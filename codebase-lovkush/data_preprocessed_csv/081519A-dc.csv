1,136,5,3,"Good morning, Doctor.  Would you please introduce yourself to the jury.",q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
2,138,5,5,Sure.  So my name is Dr. Yesh Navalgund. I'm an interventional pain management physician here in the Greater Pittsburgh Area.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
3,141,5,8,"And we're here today to take your testimony on behalf of your patient Tracy Johns regarding your evaluation and treatment of Miss Johns following a July 13, 2017, vehicle accident and any opinions you formed as a result of that treatment.

4,149,5,16,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
5,150,5,17,What type of doctor are you?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
6,151,5,18,"As I mentioned, I'm an interventional pain management physician.  My training extends from a surgery internship at the University of Virginia, anesthesiology residency at the University of Pittsburgh, and a fellowship in interventional pain management at West Virginia University.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

11,166,6,7,And what is pain management?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
12,167,6,8,"Pain management is an additional subspecialty under anesthesiology, and in some instances under rehab medicine, neurology as well. And that subspecialty includes the treatment of patients with acute and chronic pain as a result of cancer and other medical conditions as well as injuries.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,174,6,15,And how is interventional pain management different than regular pain management?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
14,176,6,17,"So pain management has over the past decade sort of split into two different types of management.  One is traditional medical management, which is basically after all sources of pain have been exhausted and there are no other alternatives we now move into medical management.  As we all know, the United States has suffered a significant crisis with the opiate crisis as a result of ignoring other options for pain.  Interventional pain management is a specialty of pain which we take, and I try to identify the actual source of injury and then treat it with minimally invasive surgical and injection therapies.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,190,7,5,And how long have you been a doctor?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
16,191,7,6,"I've been a doctor -- actually, now it's like 1999, so 20 years.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So upon completing my undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School and Saba University, went on to complete an internship in general surgery at the University of Virginia and then anesthesiology residency at the University of Pittsburgh and a fellowship in interventional pain management at West Virginia University.  Upon completion of each of the steps as I described, first, upon completion of anesthesiology residency I completed a board certification in anesthesia, which was twofold.  The first part is a written examination for testing knowledge base.  The second is an oral examination administered by experts in the field to determine competency in the field of anesthesiology.  Upon completing my fellowship training at West Virginia University in interventional pain management, an additional board certification in pain management I obtained.  And I continue to maintain certification and maintenance of that certification in pain management.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

29,243,9,6,"Sure.  A couple of highlights would be the American Society of Regional Anesthesia.  I am a founding member of the -- what they call the SIG, which is the specialty branch of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia, which focuses on minimally invasive pain management techniques.  I'm also an editor and reviewer for the Journal of Neuromodulation, which is a combined neurosurgical and pain management journal which is a peer-reviewed journal in neuromodulation.  I also am the medical director of National Bioskills Laboratories, which is a training center, one here in Pittsburgh, Dallas, Texas, as well as San Francisco, California, in which the facilities train surgeons on new techniques and both minimally invasive and invasive surgical procedures in neurosurgery, orthopedics, podiatry, as well as trauma.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,260,9,23,And let's talk a little bit about your current practice.  How long has DNA been in existence?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer

32,267,10,4,How many office locations do you have?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
33,268,10,5,"So offices, there are four locations plus two ambulatory surgical centers as well that are part of the practice.  In addition, our physicians are privileged at four hospitals in the area and perform more invasive procedures at the hospitals.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,273,10,10,And what do you do on a daily basis?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
35,274,10,11,"So my practice consists of some days clinic visits, evaluations to determine the sources of pain.  Other days I have procedural-based -- procedural-based days as well as operating room days for more invasive procedures.  And then I have days allocated at West Virginia University as well for teaching residents in the fields of anesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, neurosurgery and family medicine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,283,10,20,"And what are some types of things that you do in your interventional pain practice, such as procedures?",q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
37,286,10,23,"More common procedures that are performed are the injections which can be performed in the office where we have suites within the office that allow us to perform these procedures.  The injections range from epidural injections to radiofrequency ablation procedures, as well as some of the devices that we surgically implant, such as cancer pain pumps and things like that where we do the refills as well in the office.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,296,11,7,And how often are you performing these procedures?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
39,298,11,9,That's a good question.  At least four days a week.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

54,320,12,5,Are you familiar with costs associated with different treatments?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
55,322,12,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
56,323,12,8,How are you familiar with that?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
57,324,12,9,"So the way our practice is structured, I have my academic positions, which I'm on leadership roles within hospitals, including medical director positions, so I have an idea of costs related to hospital charges.  In the ambulatory surgical center I'm on the board for the ambulatory surgical center as well, where we routinely review costs of procedures as well as reimbursement associated with procedures.  And then, of course, in my private practice, just to stay afloat, we maintain records as well as analyze the costs of procedures and the reimbursement associated with them as well.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
58,336,12,21,My office had asked you to prepare a narrative report on behalf of Miss Johns regarding her treatment so that you could testify in that matter; is that correct?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer

70,364,13,23,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,365,13,24,"So according to your resume, and you just testified that you attended medical school at Saba University School of Medicine?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer

73,370,14,3,And where is Saba University located?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
74,371,14,4,That is in the Caribbean; Netherlands Antilles is the country.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,373,14,6,"So you attended the University of Pittsburgh for your bachelor's degree, and then you obtained your medical degree at a university in the Caribbean?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
76,377,14,10,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,378,14,11,"And you presently do some teaching, you indicated, at schools of anesthesia for the University of Pittsburgh as well as West Virginia University?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
78,382,14,15,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,383,14,16,"What type of students do you teach at those schools?  And by that I mean, are you teaching doctors, are you teaching nurses; who are you teaching at those schools?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
80,387,14,20,"At the University of Pittsburgh I'm teaching certified nurse anesthetists.  And at West Virginia University I'm teaching doctors, residents in neurology, anesthesiology, neurosurgery and family medicine.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,392,14,25,You also indicated that you're board certified in anesthesiology with a pain medicine specialty; is that correct?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
82,396,15,3,"Yes.  I obtained my original board certification in anesthesiology in 2005, I believe, and then pain medicine in 2006.  And I currently maintain certification in pain medicine since 2016.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

84,402,15,9,"No, certainly not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

86,405,15,12,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,406,15,13,"As part of your certification or otherwise, have you ever learned about what is referred to as foraminal narrowing and foraminal encroachment?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
88,409,15,16,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,410,15,17,What is meant by the term foraminal narrowing?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
90,412,15,19,"So foraminal narrowing is basically the opening where a nerve root extends out of the spinal canal.  When that narrows, or thickens, or due to trauma is displaced and it encroaches on the nerve, that's called foraminal narrowing or encroachment.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,417,15,24,Is foraminal narrowing different than foraminal encroachment?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
92,420,16,1,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,421,16,2,They're both basically the same?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
94,422,16,3,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,423,16,4,"Okay.  And as part of your certification or otherwise, have you learned about what is referred to as a disc protrusion?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
96,426,16,7,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,427,16,8,What is meant by a disc protrusion?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
98,428,16,9,So the discs themselves are basically -- be easier just to show you on the model.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,430,16,11,Sure.,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
100,431,16,12,"So the discs themselves are basically the spongy substance between the bones.  They have a shape that's almost identical to the bones above and below.  When a protrusion occurs, in this model as shown in red here, when a protrusion occurs that expands outside of its normal original shape, and that's a radiographic description, meaning looking at pictures on MRI you can see a protrusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,439,16,20,Okay.  So your current practice is located at DNA Advanced Pain Treatment Center; is that correct?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
102,442,16,23,"That's correct, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,443,16,24,What does the DNA in the name of your practice stand for?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
104,446,17,1,"Dayo Navalgund Associates.  Dayo was my original partner who unfortunately passed away with a brain tumor in 2013.  And then my wife, Dr. Brenda Navalgund, as well as myself, form the N in DNA, and the remaining associates.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,451,17,6,Okay.  So you are one of the owners of the DNA Treatment Center?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
106,453,17,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,454,17,9,And you said that's been in existence since about 2004?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
108,456,17,11,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,457,17,12,What is the approximate number of current patients that obtain treatment at the DNA Treatment Center by its doctors and other practitioners?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
110,460,17,15,"So looking at it as a whole, clinical visits, procedure visits, we encounter approximately 3,000 patient encounters a month.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,463,17,18,"And by looking at your resume, it also appeared to me that your primary practice, and you testified to this, is related to managing pain control; would that be a fair statement?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
112,467,17,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,468,17,23,And is it accurate that a regular part of your practice at DNA Treatment Center is spent providing various injections for pain relief to your patients?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
114,473,18,2,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,474,18,3,"For example, you talked about epidural injections, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
116,476,18,5,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,477,18,6,And there's facet block injections?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
118,478,18,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,479,18,8,"You might have testified to this before, and if you did I apologize; what percentage of your practice at the DNA Treatment Center would you say is related to providing injections for pain relief to patients?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
120,484,18,13,About half of the practice encounters.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
121,485,18,14,"Now, when you perform various injections at the DNA Treatment Center, is there ever any plan or expectation that those injections will be able to resolve the pain being experienced by the patient?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
122,489,18,18,"That's always the hope.  But our practice is in the management of pain, so we look for answers that may resolve pain, but mostly look for quality of life in patients.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,493,18,22,"And how about when you perform those injections, is there ever any plan or potential that that injection will resolve the pain such that the patient will not need to continue treatment at the DNA Treatment Center any longer?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
124,499,19,2,We certainly hope for that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
125,500,19,3,And have you ever seen that?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
126,501,19,4,"In various conditions, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,502,19,5,Okay.  And have you seen it where the injections have actually resolved a person's pain? You talked about hoping for it; have you actually seen it happen?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
128,506,19,9,"Yes, of course.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,507,19,10,Is the treatment that we've discussed thus far and that you perform as a regular part of your practice ever used for the treatment of generative disc disease?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
130,511,19,14,"From a management perspective, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,512,19,15,And do some of the patients that you presently treat at the DNA Treatment Center actually have degenerative disc disease?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
132,515,19,18,Sure.  It's a normal finding with age.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,516,19,19,And is degenerative disc disease a form of arthritis?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
134,518,19,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,519,19,22,And what do you mean when you say that? Why is it not a form of arthritis?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
136,521,19,24,Because a degenerative disc has nothing to do with bony malformation or arthritis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,524,20,1,But it is something you said that is common as people age?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
138,526,20,3,Yes.  Of course.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,527,20,4,And would you agree with me that degenerative disc disease may affect different people at different rates but is still just a natural part of that process of aging?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
140,531,20,8,"Of course, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,532,20,9,Are there times when degenerative disc disease becomes symptomatic requiring treatment?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
142,534,20,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,535,20,12,And that is treatment that you provide at the DNA Treatment Center?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
144,537,20,14,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,538,20,15,"Okay.  Doctor, this is not the first time you've ever been requested to provide testimony at the law firm of Simon & Simon; is it?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
146,541,20,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,542,20,19,"And Miss Johns is also not the first patient that you ever treated who also happens to be a client of the law firm of Simon & Simon, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
148,545,20,22,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,546,20,23,"What percentage of patients does your medical practice at DNA Treatment Center treat who are also clients of Miss Johns' lawyers in this case, Simon & Simon?  Just an estimate.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
150,551,21,2,If you can give me a second I can give you a percentage.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,553,21,4,Okay.,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
152,554,21,5,I'm just going to use the calculator.  I never analyzed that before.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,556,21,7,Do you have an actual number of patients that --,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
154,558,21,9,"I'm going to say approximately ten patients every couple months.  So maybe five -- five to seven patients a month.  So on the higher side, let's say seven patients a month.  Divide by our patient encounters.  About .25, so a quarter of a percent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,563,21,14,"Now, you mentioned ten; was it -- I didn't understand where the ten came from earlier.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
156,565,21,16,I said over a period of two months.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,566,21,17,"Oh, okay.  So it's seven patients per month.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
158,568,21,19,Yeah.  Plus or minus a few so. . .,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,569,21,20,Okay.,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
160,570,21,21,So. . .,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,571,21,22,So about 84 patients a year from Simon & Simon?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
162,573,21,24,"That sounds reasonable.  I don't have an exact number, but it's very close to something to that effect.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,577,22,2,Do you know a chiropractor by the name of Dr. Ralph Petrarca from the Rehab Centre?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
164,579,22,4,Not other than through our referral database system.  I don't personally know him.  I never spoke to him before.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,582,22,7,"In this case the plaintiff, Miss Johns, has previously testified that she obtained the name of Dr. Petrarca from her attorney's office of Simon & Simon, and that Dr. Petrarca referred her to you for additional treatment.  My question is, do you recall Dr. Petrarca referring Miss Johns to you for medical treatment back in October of 2017?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
166,589,22,14,"Not specifically, but I have seen his name on various referrals in the past so I wouldn't be surprised if he referred a patient to us.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,592,22,17,"Okay.  Isn't it true that many patients of Dr. Petrarca refers to the DNA Treatment Center are also clients of Miss Johns' attorney, Simon & Simon?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
168,595,22,20,That wouldn't be the case.  I've seen a number in of patients -- more patients from him than I have seen Simon & Simon related.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,598,22,23,Okay.  The medical records also indicate that another one of Miss Johns' physicians was Dr. Michelle Holding.  Do you know Dr. Holding?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
170,602,23,1,"No, I don't. I believe she's the -- either neurologist or a rehab physician that does EMGs.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,605,23,4,So you're not aware if Dr. Holding also refers various patients to you that are also clients of the law firm of Simon & Simon?  You have no knowledge of that as an owner of DNA?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
172,609,23,8,"I definitely know that some of her patients are clients of Simon & Simon, but I have no connection or know of her or talk to her so I don't know much else about her.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,613,23,12,"Okay.  Because the only thing that you know of her is that she gives you cases, clients from Simon & Simon?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
174,616,23,15,"No, just that she's a referring physician on our list of referrers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

214,707,27,2,And can you tell the jury which part of Tracy Johns this MRI is depicting?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
215,709,27,4,"Sure.  So the easiest would be to describe it based on the model itself.  So when we look at anybody's spine, for that matter, there are three segments of the spine that we consider.  The lowest is the lumbar portion; there are five lumbar vertebrae.  The middle or thoracic region, there are 12 thoracic vertebrae.  And then there are seven what we call cervical vertebrae.  Of those seven, what you're seeing in this model here are C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7.  What we're seeing on the MRI, if we look over to the right here, is exactly this view that you're looking at this way, and what you're seeing are the cervical vertebrae 1 through 7.  If we turn the spine on its side you'll be able to see from the side, which also shows you the discs in between as well as the opening in the spinal canal itself.  And so the view that we're looking at on the left side, this darkened area right here, is the spinal cord itself.  The white around the spinal cord shows up as fluid around the spinal cord.  What we're seeing -- and I'll take a little bit better slice there -- is this is C1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as we work our way down.  When we get to 1, 2, 3, 4, between 4 and 5, we start to see a little indentation here, which is the protrusion.  We discussed earlier about what a protrusion was.  And you can actually see that it's pushing back and placing an indentation against the spinal cord by pushing on the fluid.  When you get to 5 and 6, you see an additional one, slightly worse than the one above it.  So in these views here we're able to clearly identify discs that are putting pressure against the canal. The problem is, is not all discs end up protruding perfectly in one direction or another and they can be disrupted, particularly when involved in trauma or an accident.  So as we look at some of the other views -- as we look at some of the other views, you can see the various slices that show different areas and different degrees of indentation along the cord itself. So in her case, in addition to all of this, she has disruption of the facet joints at the levels above.  So the combination of the disruption of the facet joints as well as indenting against the canal produces the symptoms that she's describing, which are the radicular symptoms as well as the pain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
216,758,29,1,And you're able to determine all of this from viewing this MRI?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
217,760,29,3,"Well, from viewing the MRI and correlating it to the complaints that she has; the two go hand in hand.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

227,777,29,20,"Yes, I did.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,778,29,21,And what is an EMG?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
229,779,29,22,"So EMG falls into two categories.  So there's the EMG component of it, or electromyelography, and then there's the nerve conduction velocity testing as well.  So by placing small electrodes along the pathway of various nerves you can determine if the nerves themselves are functioning appropriately, if there's a blockage that prevents nerve signals from traveling across those nerves, or if there's weakness associated with various muscles groups that those needles are testing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,791,30,8,And did you review the EMG in this case?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
231,792,30,9,I did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
232,793,30,10,And what did Miss Johns' EMG show?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
233,794,30,11,"It did show cervical radiculopathy, and I have her impression listed here showing abnormal electrodiagnostic evidence at bilateral C5-C6, meaning as I showed you on that MRI, that level of C5-C6 was compressing, with evidence of denervation with subsequent reinnervation.  So what that basically means is, is that whenever there's damage to a particular nerve, that nerve has the ability to regenerate, doesn't always regenerate to its original state, but you can make that out based on the way nerve fibers conduct electricity. She also shows bilateral deltoid innervated by the axillary nerve at C5-C6 along that same distribution, and then the corresponding paraspinal muscles at 5-6 as well.  She shows some mild bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome affecting the sensory of the first digit.  And it seems that she wrote a prescription for pain management consult to evaluate and treat with a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
234,815,31,6,You mentioned a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.  Can you explain what radiculopathy is?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
235,818,31,9,"So anytime a nerve fiber has compression applied to it, two things happen.  The first level of compression results in what we call sensory deficit, meaning the outer layer of the nerve is responsible for the sensations that can be felt. Radiculopathy is that sensation of pain associated with that compression of the nerve itself.  Further compression will lead to what we call motor deficit, meaning that there will be loss of function so somebody can't pick up a glass or grip something. That's excessive compression of the nerve root.  But radiculopathy is particularly along the sensation that you have what we call burning or other neuropathic symptoms such as tingling or the medical term being paresthesias.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
236,833,31,24,Is radiculopathy a painful condition?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
237,834,31,25,"Certainly is, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,836,32,1,And how does it typically affect people?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
239,837,32,2,"Several ways.  One, it creates a pain that -- so, for instance, you sprain your ankle, you can bandage your ankle, you can raise your ankle, you can take some Advil, you could put some ice on it; there are things that you can do to help create a sensory change that might help distract from the pain.  Unfortunately, with radiculopathy being neuropathic in nature, there's very little that can be done for that type of pain in the way of the TLC type of things that we see with other types of sprains and injuries.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
240,848,32,13,And did you also conduct a physical examination along with reviewing her diagnostic studies?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
241,851,32,16,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,852,32,17,And what did your examination reveal?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
243,853,32,18,"So, functionally, examined the lower and upper extremity, but it seems like the cervical spine is where a lot of her range of motion resulted in -- in symptoms of facet mediated pain as well as radiating pain that resulted from the radiculopathy. As I go through I can give you the specific findings.  Inspection, exquisitely tender, radicular symptoms of the upper extremity.  No swelling or spasticity, which is good.  Did the foraminal compression or Spurling's test, which is basically turning the head and applying pressure.  Patients themselves don't know what we're looking for, so we just simply apply pressure and then mark the complaints, which usually mimic the radicular symptoms, especially when you turn your head and apply pressure.  And then the extension and rotation pain as a result of the facet-related injury.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,871,33,10,And I notice in your records you mentioned that there was a facet loading that came back positive.,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
245,874,33,13,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
246,875,33,14,Can you explain what means?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
247,876,33,15,"So basically, the easiest way to describe it is each bone of the cervical spine rests on the bone below it.  There's supposed to be a nice smooth padding between the two.  And as long as there's symmetry, much like Lego blocks, you place one on top of the other, if they're symmetric, it's no problem, but if you displace them from trauma or tumor or anything that displaces them, what you end up with is difficulty with rotation and extension. So by applying loading force, meaning pressure, and asking the patient to extend their neck, flex their neck, turn their neck left and right, you can elicit their response and correlate it with the findings on the MRI.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

259,907,34,20,"So she presented with symptoms, neck stiffness, muscle spasm, crepitus, meaning sort of this creaking sensation with range of motion.  She also complained of some shoulder pain across the right, but that's often mistaken as shoulder pain when it's actually referred pain from facet mediated discomfort.  It says it's along the back of her neck, the right sides of her neck, radiates to the trapezius, right shoulder and right upper arm. Complains that it's aching and burning and the onset immediately after MVA 7/13/2017.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

263,924,35,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
264,925,35,12,And what did you decide to do treatment-wise at that point?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
265,927,35,14,"I wanted to address the -- especially because of the radiation that she was complaining into the shoulder, I wanted to address the facet mediated pain first, and then certainly consider the radicular pain to be managed afterwards.  And so I ended up performing a C4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 facet injection for her.  And I believe I managed the left side, which was the worst.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
266,935,35,22,And can you explain for the jury what a facet block injection is?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
267,937,35,24,"Yeah, sure.  So very straight forward, as we described before, and I can show you on the model here, it's a lot easier.  Each of the bones of the cervical spine touch the bones below at a point here called the facet joint.  So a facet injection is an injection in which I take a spinal needle and I place it alongside the actual facet itself and bathe that facet with some local anesthetic and some steroids.  It's primarily a diagnostic test because, as I described before, once a facet joint has been disrupted, creates a condition called accelerated arthrosis.  So basically what would take decades to degenerate over time, when an injury takes place on a facet joint, that process is accelerated.  And the purpose of using the steroids is to help slow it down by reducing inflammation and swelling around the joint.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
268,955,36,16,And you mentioned with facet joint injuries the arthrosis accelerates?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
269,957,36,18,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
270,958,36,19,Does this injury ever go away?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
271,959,36,20,"No.  So the injury takes place, the arthrosis is accelerated.  The best we can do is over time try our best to, lack of better terms, callous the surrounding nerves to where the patient doesn't feel the problem.  The problem itself never goes away.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Confirm the right side, and then certainly look at radiofrequency ablation as a long-term treatment protocol for her.

299,1034,39,17,Can you explain what a rhizotomy is?,q,MS. HINKLE,start_answer
300,1035,39,18,"Sure.  So those facet joints that I just described earlier, they're supplied by small branches of the spinal cord called the medial branch nerves.  Those medial branch nerves are sensory only, so by burning them we don't cause or force anyone to have loss of function or movement.  And what we do is we typically will burn those nerves. And burning means using microwave energy, very similar to the microwave where you can heat food but not the bowl or dish around it, use microwave energy to generate heat to almost boiling.  And boiling being 100 degrees Centigrade, we heat to about 80 degrees Centigrade.  That causes enough disruption of the flow of those nerves.  As we've seen in the EMG as well, nerves will have a regenerative process and very often they will regenerate.  The good thing is, is they regenerate a little bit slower than other areas of the body, particularly the nervous system regenerates slower, so that usually buys us 9 to 12 months of time before we have to repeat the procedure again.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

So in this case there's three levels, and there's three levels on each side.  So that cost can vary depending on which side is hurting at what time.

Although, at Johns Hopkins, Stephen Cohen, who is the director of the fellowship training program and the director of pain medicine in Johns Hopkins, has recently looked at the value of the diagnostic injection.  And many insurance companies now demand two diagnostic injections, but he's been able to debunk that.  And we follow basically the same guidelines he does, and that is, is we do a single diagnostic injection.  So I did not recommend that she have two of them performed, just one.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

323,1123,43,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,1124,43,3,And how often would Miss Johns need this? Would she need it repeated?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
325,1126,43,5,"The injection, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,1127,43,6,And what is the cost of this procedure for a one-time?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
327,1129,43,8,"Depending on whether it's in an ambulatory surgery hospital setting or whether it's in the office, they range from 500 to $1,000 for the injection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,1133,43,12,And you also recommended some epidural steroid injections.,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
329,1135,43,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,1136,43,15,And what is that?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
331,1137,43,16,"Epidural steroid injection is basically an injection into the fat layer around the spinal cord and the exiting nerve root.  The epidural space, no different than when a pregnant woman, for instance, gets an epidural for delivery; those are a little different in that a catheter is placed and lots of numbing medicine is used.  In this case it's the same entry type of entry, but instead of the low back, it's in the neck.  And the injection bathes the fat and surrounding tissue and the nerve roots with steroids to help reduce inflammation around nerve roots and to control the radicular pain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,1150,44,3,And in your practice is this a procedure that you commonly perform?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
333,1152,44,5,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1153,44,6,How often do you perform epidural steroid injections?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
335,1155,44,8,"That's a -- it's so numerous that I couldn't give you an answer, but I would say a cervical epidural particularly, probably 25 times a week.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1159,44,12,And how often would Miss Johns need these injections?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
337,1161,44,14,"Typically we do them in series of threes. So a series a couple times a year.  Again, most of it's going to depend on the response to the initial injection and then the decisions are made beyond that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1166,44,19,And what are the costs associated with epidural steroids?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
339,1168,44,21,"Again, they range from 800 to $1,000 per injection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1170,44,23,And you also mentioned she would need some follow-ups with providers; why would she need to follow up with her providers?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
341,1174,45,1,"So there are a lot of things to we have to look at, especially after injections.  Particularly after rhizotomies as well.  We want to make sure that there wasn't anything injection related that's causing side effects or problems for the patient. We also do the follow up to see the progress, to make a decision on whether or not the next procedure ends up being the facet procedure or the procedure for radicular pain and that no new symptoms have arised since then.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1184,45,11,What is the typical cost of a follow-up appointment with a provider?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
343,1186,45,13,Anywhere from 75 to $150.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,1187,45,14,"So for all the treatment and cost projections that you just testified to, would you agree that the economic total for the future medical care Miss Johns will undergo is approximately $47,500?",q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
345,1192,45,19,"Yeah.  I was going to say somewhere shy of 50,000.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,1194,45,21,And are your opinions about future medical treatment held to a reasonable degree of medical probability?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
347,1197,45,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,1198,45,25,And are those cost projections based on your experience in the clinical outpatient and surgical setting?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
349,1202,46,3,Of course.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,1203,46,4,And does the fact that she hasn't treated with you since October of 2017 change your opinion about this future medical treatment that you're recommending?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
351,1207,46,8,"No.  I don't chase patients down. Certainly, if they want to go other places for treatment, it's their decision.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1210,46,11,And do you have any opinions about the causation of the injuries that we've discussed here today?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
353,1213,46,14,Yes.  Certainly it was a result of the motor vehicle accident that took place in July of 2017.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
354,1216,46,17,And how can injuries such as this occur in a motor vehicle collision?,q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
355,1218,46,19,"So a lot has to do with the type of accident.  If you have a front head-on collision, for instance, you end up with a lot more thoracic and cervical combined symptoms.  Sudden deceleration injuries cause a lot of lumbar-related symptoms and also can cause blood vessels to tear.  Rear end collisions we typically see a lot of whiplash type injuries; we see a lot of neck-related injuries.  I, personally, just myself, a year and a half ago experienced a rear-end type collision and I still have persistent radicular pain in my right arm as we speak.  And these are things that happen from rear-end collisions.  So it's common.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
356,1232,47,7,"Does Miss Johns' age, being 51 years old, affect your opinions in any way?",q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
357,1234,47,9,"Yeah, it does.  I mean, when you look at the degenerative changes, certainly there are some degenerative disc changes and things that are going on, but degenerative disc changes do not necessarily relate to disc bulges or protrusions or things like that.  So the fact that they've protruded and prior to that she was asymptomatic does lend me to believe that specifically the injury that took place on 7/13 was the reason why she's having these symptoms.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
358,1243,47,18,"And, Doctor, do you have an opinion as to the reasonableness and necessity of all the treatment that Miss Johns has had to date?",q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer
359,1246,47,21,I think they have all been reasonable and necessary.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
360,1248,47,23,"One last question, Doctor.  Have you given all of your opinions today to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?",q,MS. HENKLE,start_answer

490,1561,59,24,"The medical record I just handed to you also references that Miss Johns related to her chiropractor in February of 2015 that her symptoms flared up gradually over the last two months without trauma, specific incident, or known cause. Do you see that?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
491,1568,60,5,Um -- oh.  Yes.  Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1569,60,6,Do you see that?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
493,1570,60,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
494,1571,60,8,"So can neck pain, including cervical radiculopathy, ever flare up without any trauma or specific incident?  Can that happen?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
495,1574,60,11,Sure.  Anything's possible.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1575,60,12,"And does your office treat any patients who have neck pain, including pain that radiates down their arms that was not caused by an auto accident or any other known traumatic event?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
497,1579,60,16,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
498,1580,60,17,And do you treat those patients with the same type of treatment that you administered to Miss Johns in October of 2017?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
499,1583,60,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
500,1584,60,21,The February 2015 medical record that I handed to you also references that an orthopedic examination of Miss Johns' cervical spine at that time was indicative of foraminal encroachment?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
501,1588,60,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
502,1590,61,1,Do you see that?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
503,1591,61,2,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
504,1592,61,3,And is that the same foraminal encroachment that you described to me earlier --,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
505,1594,61,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
506,1595,61,6,-- where it's pinching up against nerves?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
507,1596,61,7,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1597,61,8,"And Miss Johns had that condition, that foraminal encroachment back in February of 2015?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
509,1599,61,10,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,1600,61,11,"The orthopedic examination of Miss Johns' cervical spine in February of 2015 prior to the bus accident also reveals adhesions of the nerve root, dural sleeve, or facet joint capsule. Do you see that?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
511,1605,61,16,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
512,1606,61,17,What does that mean?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
513,1607,61,18,I have no idea.  This depressor test seems to be a chiropractic type test that really doesn't show anything that makes any sense at all.  I would imagine that you would need an MRI to visualize adhesions of a nerve root.  There's no way to examine a patient for adhesions of a nerve root.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
514,1613,61,24,"Now, your written report, I'm going to refer to that once again, regarding Miss Johns for this litigation.  After referring to that March 2015 diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, it indicates: ""However, her pain was significantly improved and there were no further complaints."" Do you see that?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
515,1621,62,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
516,1622,62,7,At what point in time after March of 2015 did Miss Johns have no further complaints about neck pain?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer

518,1627,62,12,Let me ask you this --,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
519,1628,62,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
520,1629,62,14,-- were you ever made aware that Miss Johns had to seek additional treatment for neck pain and cervical radiculopathy after that point in time?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
521,1632,62,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
522,1633,62,18,More specifically in August of 2015; do you have any knowledge of that?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
523,1635,62,20,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
524,1636,62,21,"Okay.  Prior to preparing your report for this litigation in November of 2018, did you ever review any medical records from the UPMC Centers for Rehab Services regarding physical therapy that Miss Johns received in August of 2015 for new neck pain?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
525,1642,63,1,Let me just verify the UPMC records that I have.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
526,1644,63,3,I will submit to you that when I look at your report under records review --,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
527,1646,63,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
528,1647,63,6,-- I do not see anything listed for UPMC Centers for Rehab Services.,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
529,1649,63,8,"Then I would not have, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
530,1650,63,9,"Okay.  Now, did Miss Johns' law firm, Simon & Simon, ever provide you with any medical records from physical therapy that Miss Johns received in August 2015 to treat for that new neck pain for you to review prior to testifying here at trial?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
531,1655,63,14,"Not that I'm aware of, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
532,1656,63,15,"I now want to speak to you about x-rays taken of Miss Johns' cervical spine prior to the bus accident. Now, the report from the x-rays of Miss Johns' cervical spine in February of 2015 indicates: ""Degenerative disc disease is mild at C5-C6.  There is bilateral mild to moderate neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-C6."" Do you see that on the x-ray report?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
533,1665,63,24,Yes.  Certainly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,1666,63,25,And did you review this medical record prior to preparing your report regarding this litigation in November of the 2018?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
535,1670,64,3,Yes.  This is the Metro Community Health information.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
536,1672,64,5,And is the neural foraminal narrowing that is referenced in Miss Johns' February 2015 x-ray the same as the foraminal narrowing that you described to me earlier?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
537,1676,64,9,No.  Because the foraminal narrowing I showed you on the MRI was not mild to moderate.  It was moderate to severe.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
538,1679,64,12,"Okay.  And I'm talking about the idea of neural foraminal narrowing, what that is.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
539,1681,64,14,Sure.  Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
540,1682,64,15,"It's the same thing, right?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
541,1683,64,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,1684,64,17,And is the degenerative disc disease that is referenced in Miss Johns' February 2015 x-ray progressive in nature?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
543,1687,64,20,Of course it is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,1688,64,21,"So that's to say that a person's degenerative disc disease can get more severe simply as a result of the passage of time, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
545,1691,64,24,Right.  But it won't protrude like it did on the MRI as I showed you.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
546,1694,65,1,"So a person's discs in their neck can degenerate over time without the need for a specific traumatic event or incident, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
547,1697,65,4,"Yes, of course.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
548,1698,65,5,And can a person's -- I think you were talking about this earlier -- can a person's degenerative disc disease result in a disc being protruded?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
549,1702,65,9,Can a degenerative. . .,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
550,1703,65,10,"Can a person's degenerative disc disease ultimately result in a disc protrusion?  And by way of example, you testified regarding yourself.  I have also had back surgery and I have disc protrusions.  I've never any traumatic events or car accidents or anything.  I have a disc protrusion.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
551,1709,65,16,"Sure.  But that isn't the result of degeneration.  Disc degeneration leads to dehydration, and it's the opposite of protrusion; it would actually contract.  So a protrusion -- two things can happen that result in a protrusion.  A trauma or accident results in a protrusion.  And then a normal or healthy disc with poor spine alignment can result in a protrusion.  But degeneration in and of itself doesn't cause protrusion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
552,1720,66,1,"So we just discussed Miss Johns' x-rays taken of her cervical spine in February of 2015, which was before the accident, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
553,1723,66,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,1724,66,5,"And then she had an MRI taken of her cervical spine over two years later in September of 2017 after the bus accident, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
555,1727,66,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
556,1728,66,9,"And then she also had a CAT scan, CT scan of her cervical spine taken the same day as the bus accident, which was negative for any acute fractures, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
557,1732,66,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
558,1733,66,14,"Are you aware of or did you otherwise review any reports from any other x-rays, MRIs or other diagnostic tests of Miss Johns' cervical spine taken during that two and a half-year time period between February of 2015 and September of 2017?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
559,1738,66,19,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
560,1739,66,20,Would you agree that there is no way that you can determine the age of Miss Johns' cervical condition that is referenced and you talked about in detail in her September 2017 MRI report?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
561,1743,66,24,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
562,1744,66,25,Okay.  And likewise would you agree that any disc protrusion that may have been noted in Miss Johns' MRI from September of 2017 may have existed prior to the bus accident ever taking place?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
563,1749,67,4,Of course.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
564,1750,67,5,And would you also agree that a person can have the cervical condition that is referenced in Miss Johns' September 2017 MRI and still be pain free?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
565,1754,67,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
566,1755,67,10,"So even though Miss Johns may have been pain free in July of 2017 at the time of the bus accident, that doesn't mean that Miss Johns was also free of any degenerative disc disease; does it?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
567,1759,67,14,No.  Of course not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
568,1760,67,15,"In fact, the degenerative disc disease that Miss Johns had, at least as of February 2015, is not something that just goes away; is it?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
569,1763,67,18,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
570,1764,67,19,"Additionally, even though Miss Johns may have been pain free in July of 2017 at the time of the bus accident, that also doesn't necessarily mean that Miss Johns was also free of any disc protrusion, right?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
571,1769,67,24,Of course.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
572,1770,67,25,"So once again, you evaluated Miss Johns on October 18th of 2017, which is the same day that you gave her the facet injections, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
573,1774,68,3,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
574,1775,68,4,"Based upon your review of the medical records provided by Miss Johns' attorneys to your office, do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns receiving any additional facet injections since that day in October of 2017?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
575,1780,68,9,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
576,1781,68,10,Do you have any knowledge of Miss Johns receiving any chiropractic treatment or physical therapy regarding her neck since November of 2017?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer

579,1788,68,17,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
580,1789,68,18,"So in December of this year, 2019, to the best of your knowledge Miss Johns is coming up on two entire years of no treatment for her neck injuries, correct?  To the best of your knowledge.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
581,1793,68,22,"The information I'm given, I have no idea where or what treatment she's had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
582,1795,68,24,"But according to your report that you prepared for Miss Johns' attorneys as part of this litigation, you believe that Miss Johns now needs to receive three cervical epidural injections every six months for no less than ten years, right?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
583,1801,69,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
584,1802,69,5,So would you agree that comes to an alleged need of 60 epidural injections over the next ten years for Miss Johns?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
585,1805,69,8,"Potentially, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
586,1806,69,9,And you also believe that in addition to those epidural injections Miss Johns needs another facet block as well as the cervical ablation procedures every 12 months for no less than ten years?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
587,1811,69,14,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
588,1812,69,15,"So according to your report, although you have no knowledge of Miss Johns receiving any treatment for her neck injury since December of 2017, over the next ten years you believe that Miss Johns will need 60 epidural injections, another facet block, and 12 cervical ablations, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
589,1818,69,21,Ten -- that would be ten ablations.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
590,1819,69,22,Ten ablations?  Okay.  Correct?,q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
591,1820,69,23,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
592,1821,69,24,"Okay.  And you testified earlier this morning when I was asking you about that type of treatment provided by your office, such treatment can actually or has potential to resolve a patient's symptoms, correct?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
593,1827,70,4,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
594,1828,70,5,"That's the reason why you give that type of treatment, right?",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer
595,1830,70,7,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
596,1831,70,8,"Now, we've discussed previously the date of your report, once again, is November 19th of 2018.",q,MR. FOLEY,start_answer

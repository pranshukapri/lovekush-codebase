7,166,5,20,"My name is Joseph Blum and I represent Mercedes-Benz in a case that's been brought by Millers Capital insurance. I'm going to ask you a series of questions today.  If at any time you don't understand the question, please let me know and I'll be happy to restate it.  I would ask that you keep all your responses verbal because the court reporter cannot take down our nods or our shrugs.  I would also ask that you try to let me finish my question before you start to speak so that she can take one of us down at a time. Do you understand all that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
8,181,6,10,I understand.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,182,6,11,Is there anything that would prevent you from testifying accurately today?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
10,184,6,13,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
11,185,6,14,Okay.  Can you tell me how long you've worked for your current company?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
12,187,6,16,Let me think about it.  I want to say from 2000 is when I hooked up with John Elliott as a subcontractor with John.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
13,190,6,19,And are you a subcontractor there now?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
14,192,6,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
15,193,6,22,Okay.  And what services does he contract with you?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
16,195,6,24,"Basically the handling of property claims, generally the larger property claims as opposed to the smaller ones.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
17,199,7,3,All right.  And do you evaluate claims for other people or independently?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
18,201,7,5,"I have adjusted some independently to my own company, which is B&W Claims, LLC. I also am a subcontractor with Provencher, P-R-O-V-E-N-C-H-E-R, Claims, LLC.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

20,207,7,11,First-party property claims.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
21,208,7,12,"Are they typically commercial, residential, or both?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
22,210,7,14,"90% commercial, 10% residential.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
23,211,7,15,And how long have you worked like as an independent adjuster yourself?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
24,213,7,17,"Since '99, 1999.  And then when I first started in the business, which was in '77 or '78.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
25,216,7,20,"Okay.  So in '77 or '78 you started in the claims business, is that what you're saying?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
26,219,7,23,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
27,220,7,24,How did you get started?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
28,222,8,1,My dad was an independent and I was looking to change from working for a title company.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
29,225,8,4,"And then from '77, '78 all the way to '99, have you operated independently or did you work for other people?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
30,228,8,7,"No.  From, it's either late '77 to I believe August of '79 I was with a company in Nebraska called State Farmers, not State Farm, that wrote basically farm and residential. And in '79 I went to work for American General Fire and Casualty/Maryland Casualty in Dallas.  Was in the Dallas office four years as first was an auto adjuster, then I picked up liability, then I did comp and did property. And I want to say in '83 I went to Midland Odessa with them as a claims manager of a claims office.  '84 was in San Antonio for a year as a branch supervisor for workers' comp and property.  And '85 went to the regional office as a general adjuster in Houston.  And in '89 was brought up to Baltimore, the home office, as a regional general adjuster for the northeast territory. And then from there to '99, at some point I went inside as a home office property manager, and then the titles changed just to give me more money.  I'm raised time, so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
31,252,9,6,You said you worked for a title company before that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
32,254,9,8,"Chicago Title Insurance Company back in '76, I think it was '76, '75, '76, in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
33,257,9,11,All right.  And can you tell us what your educational background is?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
34,259,9,13,"Graduated high school in '73, did a year at college at Bellevue Junior College, and then went out into the work force.  With American General I completed the Insurance Institute of America three-part course and then the associate in claims course.  And then did the five-year with the -- I'm trying to think of the society -- senior claims loss associate is the final designation I've got. And, of course, all the training for business income, property, storms, whatever.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
35,270,9,24,"And are those, when you refer to that, are those like company training programs that you're talking about?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
36,274,10,3,They're national insurance training programs.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
37,276,10,5,Okay.  And so they were outside of the insurance company with like different associations?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
38,279,10,8,"Yeah.  The American Educational Institute is a national -- they provide the training or classes or educational material for all divisions of the insurance industry. And then you have the senior claims loss associate, which again is the American Educational Institute, and that's the five-year program on that aspect. And then, of course, you've got the individual training throughout the course that are put on by different entities like the Loss Executives Association, has training seminars. There was Insurance Technical Institute, which was an estimating program.  Then various accounting programs of which I had an accounting background anyway, so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
39,295,10,24,And at some point were you retained to work on or adjust a loss that occurred at the Clemens Cleaning facility here in Lansdale?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
40,300,11,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
41,301,11,5,What were you asked to do?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
42,302,11,6,"Millers' instructions are generally the same on all their claims, is basically I act as the independent adjuster, I evaluate the damages, review the coverages, and see how the damages comply or fall within the different coverages that are available. Determine whether or not we had possible subrogation, just on what the cause may be, and suggest and recommend cause and origin experts to come in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,312,11,16,All right.  And you said typically that's what Millers does.  Is that what they did here?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
44,315,11,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,316,11,20,Okay.  And had you adjusted claims for Millers before this?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
46,318,11,22,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,319,11,23,Approximately how often?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
48,320,11,24,"That's a good question.  They generally account probably, I can answer it this way, generally about 40% of my income, yearly income comes from working claims for Millers.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,326,12,5,"And when they hire you, do they pay you per hour, do they pay you per claim?  I mean, how do they compensate you?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
50,329,12,8,I'm on a time and expense basis. And it depends on the complexity of the claim as to whether we charge them a regular adjuster rate or whether we charge them a general adjuster rate.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,334,12,13,Okay.  And did you in fact work on the Clemens loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
52,336,12,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,337,12,16,What was the first thing you did on that loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
54,339,12,18,"Received the loss notice, and I believe Alex had an appointment set up for onsite inspection, so I made arrangements to meet at the site with Alex.  And I believe I had already enlisted or I had recommended a cause and origin.  Simply because of the size of it, it's almost standard practice to find out what the origin of the fire is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,348,13,2,And did you actually go to the scene to look at the building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
56,350,13,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,351,13,5,And did you meet a representative of the insured there as well?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
58,353,13,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,354,13,8,"Do you know who that was, do you remember who that was?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
60,356,13,10,Mr. Clemens.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,357,13,11,Randy?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
62,358,13,12,"Without reviewing his emails, younger guy, met him on several occasions at the site.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,361,13,15,"All right.  And when you went in to the site, had a determination been made as to whether or not the entire building would be torn down?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
64,365,13,19,"At my initial inspection, the fire marshal was there, and I spoke with him, referenced what they had done and what they were wanting.  And I made recommendations to Alex on site that we needed to bring a structural engineer in to look at the building to make an ascertation of what was rebuildable, what was not rebuildable, and what was structurally damaged and what wasn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,375,14,4,And was in fact a structural engineer retained?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
66,377,14,6,"I believe so, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,378,14,7,All right.  Let me show you a document that we marked earlier today as Hart Exhibit No. 2 and ask you if you have ever seen that before?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
68,382,14,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,383,14,12,And what is that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
70,384,14,13,"That's the evaluation report provided by Charles Timbie, structural engineer, on his inspection of the property.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,387,14,16,And was the purpose of that inspection to determine whether or not the entire structure had to be taken down?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
72,390,14,19,It was to look at the entire structure and determine what was structurally sound and what wasn't.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,393,14,22,And what was your understanding of what his results were?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
74,395,14,24,"Standing at the front of the building, basically about two-thirds of it to the right had been determined to be structurally unsound and would need to come down.  My best recollection, it was the last bay plus the interior wall and cement slab over in that area, plus the original cement slab I believe needed some repairs. But exterior walls, roof-wise, probably about two-thirds of the building, all of the exterior finish, all of the roof finish, all the insulation, all the interior drywall. And without looking at a diagram, there was one bay -- I believe there was four bays -- so the one bay where the fire started, the adjoining wall, part of the next wall. And I believe that left the exterior and interior wall of the last bay, again with the slab and framing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,416,15,20,Was there a determination made at some point to take the whole building down?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
76,418,15,22,That would have been the insured's decision.  I looked at it and valued it as a repairable building.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,422,16,1,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_chat
78,423,16,2,"I'm going to mark, if we could, as Bennett Exhibit 1 a handwritten diagram.",side_chat,MR. BLUM,symbols

82,431,16,10,"Mr. Bennett, do you recognize this handwritten diagram?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
83,433,16,12,"It's not mine, I can tell you that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,434,16,13,"That was the question, actually, so you got one step ahead of me, that's fine, you can put it aside. At some point were you asked to provide an estimate to repair and/or replace the building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
85,440,16,19,I proceeded with the repairability estimate based on what the engineer had advised me needed was structurally unsound.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,443,16,22,I'm going to show you a document which we marked as Exhibit 3 this morning and ask you if you can identify this for us?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
87,447,17,1,"That's my email to Randy, Randy Clemens.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,449,17,3,And what is it that is attached with your email?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
89,451,17,5,"That's per my email, my preliminary estimate on the rebuild with an ACV replacement cost and actual cash value number.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,454,17,8,"Okay.  So can you tell me, is that the cost, is that estimate the cost to repair the building without the entire thing being torn down?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
91,458,17,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,459,17,13,And did you at any time try to make an estimate of what the actual value of the building was the day before the fire took place?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
93,463,17,17,"I don't believe I did a full valuation on the building, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,465,17,19,"Did you know, was anyone else asked to do that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
95,467,17,21,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
96,468,17,22,"So can you tell me -- you mentioned several numbers, I just want to make sure we're all on the same wavelength -- there is various columns on that estimate, one of which is like, I think it's a cost per unit or unit cost?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
97,475,18,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
98,476,18,5,"Tell me what that, your intention of what that means, what does unit cost mean?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
99,478,18,7,"That's numbers obtained from the Marshall Swift valuation program that I utilize to provide the estimate.  An example would be architectural fees, which generally is a percentage of the estimate, and it comes out to 33,500 for the architectural piece. Everything else represents, another example would be replace vinyl siding insulation, this is after the demolition, $1.52 a square foot, which includes labor and material.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
100,489,18,18,"So you mentioned a computer program, the Marshall Swift program, just tell us generally what that is?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
101,492,18,21,"Marshall Swift is, basically it's a nationwide evaluation program that you can do building valuations on, from residential to any type of commercial.  You can also go in and utilize the unit features for individual building, for framing, for masonry, for insulation, for mechanical, and so forth. It's a recognized valuation program that it can also be used as a rebuild by the insurance industry and most contractors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,503,19,7,And so is that estimate that's sitting in front of you like a printout that came directly from that program?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
103,506,19,10,"No.  This is my -- I input the numbers, I use a program called Simsol, which is an estimating program based off of National Construction Estimator price, plus additional pricing.  And as, which you didn't ask me about, part of what I do is I maintain the database for Simsol and updating and developing pricing.  The majority of that pricing is from National Construction Estimator, some of it utilizes RSMeans, which is another construction program. This type of building I pulled strictly all the numbers from the Marshall Swift and input them into my program, because I'm able to put square footages and room dimensions and then change the pricing to whichever program I'm utilizing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,524,20,3,So I just want to make sure I understand exactly everything you just said. So you went to the Marshall Swift program first?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
105,528,20,7,"Marshall Swift, it's actually a manual, it's about longer than legal and about 3 inches thick, and they do provide software that I can go in and pull the pricing out, but it's not really estimating -- it's for valuation and estimating purposes, but then you would have to either write it down or incorporate it, it's not an estimating software.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
106,537,20,16,"Okay.  So is it accurate then that you took some of the data from the Marshall Swift program, and tell me what you did with that data?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
107,541,20,20,"All of the data was taken and all the pricing was taken from the Marshall Swift valuation program in the individual unit breakdowns as opposed to a square foot valuation.  Okay, yes. A little explanation:  Marshall Swift breaks it down.  You can do building valuations on a square foot with additions, or you can go in and actually do a complete rebuild estimate starting with your footers, your foundation, your slabs, whatever type of wall you're dealing with, masonry, your interior finish, your interior framing.  It's providing a detailed estimate. And all I did was take the numbers, the most current numbers from there, and incorporate them into my estimating program so that I could produce an estimate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
108,560,21,14,"Okay.  So you took the data from the Marshall Swift, both the books and the program, and then you put that information into the estimating software that you used?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
109,564,21,18,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
110,565,21,19,"Okay.  So the per unit costs that are listed there, are they from Marshall Swift?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
111,568,21,22,They're from Marshall Swift.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,569,21,23,And then after the per unit cost there is an RCV number?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
113,572,22,1,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,573,22,2,What does RCV stand for in this context?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
115,575,22,4,Replacement cost value.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,576,22,5,"What does that mean, what do you interpret that to mean?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
117,578,22,7,"That's basically if something costs $5 a square foot today and you have 200 square feet, that would be roughly, what, $1,000 to replace at today's cost.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,582,22,11,So is it taking the unit cost and applying it to what has to be done in this project?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
119,585,22,14,It's taking the unit cost and applying it to the square footage involved.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,587,22,16,"And then after that there is a column, I think it's labeled DEP.  What is that column?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
121,590,22,19,Depreciation.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,591,22,20,What does depreciation have to do with in this context?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
123,593,22,22,"Under -- every replacement cost policy, you can have a policy that is either on an actual cash value basis or on a replacement cost basis.  And under the loss payment clause of all replacement cost policies, the insured is entitled to the actual cash value of the loss at the time of the loss.  He can then make claim for the replacement cost, as long as he notifies the carrier within 180 days that he's going to make claim under the replacement cost. So the policy was a replacement cost policy, therefore I determined the replacement cost value.  I assessed depreciation, which is a combination of the condition of the building based on my site inspection as well as utilizing relative information provided by the Marshall Swift program as to what depreciation should be, based on the age.  But that all is, I want to say it's subjective, because it's based on the condition of the buildings.  You apply the depreciation to the replacement cost, and that gives you your depreciation amount.  So, in other words, if you have $100,000 loss and you're applying 20% depreciation, your depreciation amount would be $20,000.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
124,622,24,1,"Okay.  And so in the depreciation column, it is the amount of, like the amount of depreciation you took?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
125,625,24,4,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
126,626,24,5,"Okay.  And tell me in this context with this loss, was there a percentage that you applied across the board of depreciation?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
127,629,24,8,"I would have to go back and look at each individual number.  Within the program itself I'm able to go back and see what was applied.  Generally I'll look at an overall average and then I look at the individual materials.  If the interior finish is in good condition, it can range anywhere from 20 to 35 or 40 percent.  Generally I don't go over 50% unless the building is completely dilapidated. This building was in good condition, so, again, without going into the internal program or doing some calculations here, I don't know if I applied an overall percentage across the board or whether I did it individually by trade or material.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
128,644,24,23,"And when you say go back and look in the program, which program are you referring to?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
129,648,25,2,"The estimating program, Simsol that I ultimately put the prices in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
130,650,25,4,And what did you use or how did you determine what the original condition of this building was before the fire?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
131,653,25,7,"You can look at a building after a fire and see what the exterior condition is, look in parts of the building where it's undamaged.  And generally the fire in that area just showed a lot of heavy smoke and you can tell whether the building's been maintained or not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
132,660,25,14,And what was your opinion at that time as to whether or not the building has been maintained?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
133,663,25,17,"The building appeared to be in good condition, better than most.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
134,665,25,19,"So if you look at the last page, which is the summary of your estimate, the very back.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
135,668,25,22,All the way back?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
136,669,25,23,"Keep going all the way to the end, it's double-sided copy.  That page is an estimate summary for your entire estimate; is that correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
137,674,26,3,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
138,675,26,4,Okay.  And so the actual cash value for the repair came out to like 1.9 million; is that correct?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
139,678,26,7,That is correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
140,679,26,8,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_chat
141,680,26,9,Can I --,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
142,681,26,10,If he asks the question.,side_chat,MR. GOGINENI,start_question
143,684,26,13,"Go ahead, were you going to explain something?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
144,686,26,15,"Yeah.  This is the summary details where it's broken down by area group within the estimate, I had about six different groups.  You also find the totals of the estimate on Page 5 of the estimate, which is really the last page of the estimate, it gives you the summary amount there. The next two pages detail trade breakdown, that just breaks out the trade, does not include overhead, profits, and taxes, which is why you will have different numbers on the RCV, depreciation, and ACV. And then you get to the group detail, which when you go into the estimate starting on Page 1, you will find main building right is a grouping, which will go along with main building right here.  This totals each of the individual groups that I had for the building.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,706,27,10,Okay.  And did you have a set of photographs that you took that went along with your initial review that led to this assessment?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
146,710,27,14,"Oh, I probably had anywhere from 40 to 100 overall photos at different times on different inspections.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,713,27,17,"Okay.  And when I gave you that email, the title, it's entitled that it's the preliminary estimate.  I personally have not seen any other estimates.  Do you know, was there any subsequent estimate to that one?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
148,718,27,22,"No.  At that point I was in excess of the policy limits, based on these repair numbers, and any adjustments that would have been needed upwards would have still been in excess of the policy limits.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,724,28,3,"So I take it from your answer then, as far as you recall, there was never a need to go beyond the initial estimate?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
150,727,28,6,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,728,28,7,"And what, if anything, did you do in terms of monitoring whether or not the insured rebuilt the building and submitted claims for that rebuilding?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
152,732,28,11,"Basically the insured advised me that they were going to just replace the entire building and rebuild it to suit their needs, which is his option. He then had to submit to me all of the expenses that were being incurred so I could review them, see what was covered under the policy, what wasn't covered under the policy, so I could insure that the full 2.3 was expended in the replacement of the building.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,743,28,22,"When you say the full 2.3, what do you mean by that number?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
154,745,28,24,"The 2.3 million and change was the policy limit.  My estimate was in excess of that.  As long as the insured expended the full 2.3 in excess of the policy limit, over the 2.4 -- my estimate, he would be entitled to recover the depreciation up to the policy limit.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,753,29,7,And did you in fact follow the procedure and monitor the rebuilding and submitting those invoices?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
156,756,29,10,"I didn't monitor, but Randy Clemens submitted to me all the invoices.  And then I proceeded and prepared spreadsheets on all the individual invoices from the main general contractor, the emergency services that were provided, as well as some of the subcontractors.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,763,29,17,And what did you do with those spreadsheets?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
158,765,29,19,Provided them to the carrier.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,766,29,20,"Okay.  And just tell me generally what they look like, what would one of those spreadsheets look like?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
160,769,29,23,"Basically Excel spreadsheets that start over with the general contractor, his totals, and then the breakdown.  And I had found where some subcontractor direct invoices provided to Randy were submitted to me previously, so they had to be deducted, you know, from -- I believe the general contractor was Fenster, I don't recall exactly.  But the GC was paying the subs direct, and Randy had actually submitted me some of the sub bids directly.  So they were duplicated within my spreadsheets and I made sure that there was no duplications, and that certain items that would not have been covered under the policy were not included within the totals.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,785,30,14,Okay.  Do you have any examples of what those would be that would not have been covered?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
162,788,30,17,"Excavation, land filling, striping of the parking lot, things like along those lines that were normally excluded under the policy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,792,30,21,"And what else, if anything, did you do in the adjustment of this loss?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
164,794,30,23,Worked with Randy on his loss of income claim.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,797,31,1,And tell me what was the loss of income claim?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
166,799,31,3,The amount?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,800,31,4,No.  What was the basis of the loss of income?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
168,802,31,6,"Clemens, the dry cleaning operations, occupied I want to say probably 60% of the building, and I believe there was one other tenant-occupied area.  So the lease for the one tenant was obtained in order to ascertain the rent that was being charged by the dry cleaning.  They provided financial records showing what was being internally paid for the rent space, as well as the CAM adjustments, which would have been the charges for prorated taxes based on the amount of square footage being occupied by the tenant, maintenance, things like that that fall within the CAM. So you spread that out over the time period of 12 months along with the CAM adjustments, which the history was on the full taxes, and the taxes were actually dropped after the fire, so we had to wait for the revised or new tax bill. And so those amounts were adjusted and that was determined to be the loss of income under the terms of the policy for the 12 months, and then there was a 60-day extension beyond that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,828,32,7,"All right.  And what was your involvement, did you verify all that or how did you -- what was your personal part in taking care of that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
170,832,32,11,"Oh, I had the lease and verified the payments and verified the tax bills and then put together the spreadsheets.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,835,32,14,"And was that a spreadsheet that, again, you provided to the insurance company?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
172,837,32,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,838,32,17,"And I just want to make sure I understand.  So did the insurance company reimburse the insured for the full payment of the lease, the full amount of the lease?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
174,842,32,21,"It would have been per my spreadsheet calculation.  As I said, the rental portion pretty much stayed the same for the 12 months, that's set.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,847,33,1,Right.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
176,848,33,2,"The CAM was adjusted according to what the new taxes were, which reflected a drop over the previous year, so obviously the taxes were dropped by the local borough or officials once the building was destroyed or damaged. So the loss of income included the lease amounts from the dry cleaners as well as the one tenant -- and I'm going from memory -- along with the CAM because that was paid in addition to the base lease amount.  And that amount was figured for 12 months.  And then for the additional 60 days, I believe there was a 35% calculation.  The 60 days under the policy is provided from when the building is substantially built or the stock is replenished so that you can reopen.  It gives the insured an additional 60 days to get back up to full. Clemens Dry Cleaners had basically occupied about, I want to say 65%, and there was still 10% undone, I'd have to look at my reports.  But they occupied a percentage, there was a percentage still being done.  So in order to conclude the claim for the additional 60 days, it was agreed on a 35% loss for those next two months.  And then that closed down the claim.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,877,34,6,"Just so I understand what your answer is, that 35% you quoted, or if it's 30, whichever it was, was a number that you negotiated with Clemens?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
178,881,34,10,"Basically it's, you take what they're losing, and if they were losing 10,000 a month in leases and the percentage was 30 or 35, 30% of 10,000 would have been $3,000 for each of the 60-day period.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,886,34,15,"I'm just trying to get to, how did you get to that percentage?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
180,888,34,17,"I looked at what percentage of the building they were occupying and using to run their operations, the percentage, approximate percentage of the building that was yet to be completed, so, and what would have been available for rent had they rebuilt the same building.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,895,34,24,"Okay.  And just so I'm clear, in the way this coverage was written, there was no attempt by the insurance company to deduct from the income amount that was reimbursed the amount of money that was saved by them by not operating the building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
182,902,35,6,"No.  Each of the tenants, the dry cleaning was separate from the owner, okay? So the tenants were responsible for the utilities, as I remember correctly.  So the only savings to the building would have been any reduction in property taxes and so forth. Had the building been vacant, he would have incurred additional utility expenses.  So in my estimation there was no reduction in expenses other than the property taxes had been reduced.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,913,35,17,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
184,914,35,18,"And there was no management company involved, payments were made direct to the named insured on the building.  So therefore there was no management fee to reduce the amount of the rent spot.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,919,35,23,Okay.  Was there anything else that you recall doing in the adjustment of the loss for this fire?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
186,923,36,2,"Other than, I met with the engineers, met with the cause and origin people, met with the fire marshal, met with the insured on various occasions, and did several inspections and followup inspections on the rebuild, so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,929,36,8,"And other than hiring the experts for the cause and origin investigation, what other involvement did you have, if any, in that investigation?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
188,933,36,12,As far as trying to make a determination of the cause?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

There were several people, I had signed in on the log just to basically look at what they were doing, but then to do what I needed to do on the building.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
193,949,37,3,"All right.  And when the Mercedes people were there, did you have any discussion with them at all?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

234,1067,41,21,Okay.  And I know you said that generally sometimes you will see if there's any subrogation issues when you get hired by Millers.  Do you remember if you made any recommendations about subrogation in regards to this loss?,q,MR. GARBARINO,start_answer
235,1074,42,3,"I can give you in general how that works.  I don't recall specifically on this particular claim.  When the origin and cause gives me have an approximate or gives me a verbal as to the cause, and it appears it may be something that needs further investigation for potential subrogation, then I would recommend passing along that information to the carrier. On this particular case I believe everybody, the cause and origin was reporting direct to a counsel that had been enlisted, a subrogation counsel, which is almost standard practice on any loss of any specific size, just to get subrogation counsel involved early on to make sure that all steps that he needs are covered.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

Did the equipment like come to your new space and then you worked on it or when did you work on it just in terms of not the date, but in terms of logistics of what was happening?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
455,1147,45,5,"Most of the stuff sat in EDS's warehouse for about a week until we had the space available.

We did that ourselves.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
456,1155,45,13,And was this spreadsheet that's marked as Farr Exhibit 2 put together as the things came off the pallets?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
457,1158,45,16,"A combination of things.  Immediate replacement, so I don't know the date of this one, but as we went into finding which was operable, which wasn't, then we replaced certain items.  So it's probably some combination.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

459,1166,45,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
460,1168,46,1,So to the best of your knowledge is this the first of these spreadsheets that you put together?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
461,1171,46,4,"I believe so, the time frame would suggest that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
462,1173,46,6,"Okay.  And if we could, I just want to identify what each of the columns are for. The first --",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
463,1176,46,9,Where it was -- these were the locations codes that I gave to Farr to identify where they were so that he could like tie them to pictures if he needed to.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

469,1190,46,23,"For example, some of them would be like office equipment or shop equipment, so I don't know all the codes now that I'm looking at them, but that's kind of what those codes stood for in terms of the classification of the kind of equipment that was being replaced.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
470,1197,47,5,"Okay.  And then as we go across, the next thing it appears there's something filled in is ""Replacement Cost.""  Do you see that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
471,1200,47,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
472,1201,47,9,Did you put those replacement cost numbers in there?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

484,1222,48,5,Is that the actual cost of what you spent?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
485,1224,48,7,"Yes, I would believe so, yes, because they're very specific.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

491,1234,48,17,"This is, what I would do is accumulate something and submit, so that would be that column.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
492,1237,48,20,Okay.  So what this appears to be then is the receipts and the spreadsheet you put together for the period July 15th to August 15th that you then submitted to the insurance company?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
493,1243,49,1,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

495,1247,49,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
496,1248,49,6,"So, in other words, what they didn't do is say to you, ""You had a used piece of equipment, we're just going to pay you the used value""?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
497,1252,49,10,"I don't recall that discussion.  But I submitted our expenses to get operational, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

516,1295,51,3,Okay.  I'm going to show you a document which was marked previously as Farr Exhibit No. 6 and ask you if you know what that document is?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
517,1299,51,7,"It's items that we threw away, didn't specifically replace, probably.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
518,1301,51,9,"Okay.  When you say items we threw away, are they items that essentially were left at the old facility?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
519,1304,51,12,"It might be a combination, but there was a salvage done of what was remaining that we didn't pull out of the building, due to time and just not worth the effort.  So the answer is maybe these were most of the things that were left but not necessarily all of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
520,1311,51,19,So some of them might have come out and were scrapped?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
521,1313,51,21,"Were scrapped, sitting in the back that we couldn't do anything with, because then we had time to assess their utility.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
522,1316,51,24,"Sure.  Now, in terms of the columns on this one, ""Location"" and ""Item"" are the same?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

527,1326,52,9,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
528,1327,52,10,Did you personally put in that original cost item?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
529,1329,52,12,"They were guesstimates that I made, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
530,1331,52,14,And did you do any research when you put those numbers together?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
531,1333,52,16,"We had done some but not directly, just knowing what things generally cost.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
532,1335,52,18,Okay.  So it wasn't like you sat down and you went on the Internet and you looked up the cost of those particular items?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
533,1338,52,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
534,1339,52,22,And did you have any like business records that you used in order to look for the original cost of those items?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
535,1343,53,1,"If they were, they were lost, but the answer is no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

539,1350,53,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
540,1351,53,9,"And, again, was that based upon your personal recollection of how old those items were?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
541,1354,53,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,1355,53,13,"All right.  Then there's a column that says ""Scrap Value,"" I think it says ""Estimated at 20%.""  Do you see that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
543,1358,53,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,1359,53,17,What does that column represent?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

546,1363,53,21,"And the amount, the 20%, what, if anything, did you do to arrive at that number?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
547,1365,53,23,Guess.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
548,1366,53,24,Okay.  Was it based on any discussion you had with anyone from the insurance company?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
549,1370,54,3,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

551,1375,54,8,"On some, probably.  On others they were estimates.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
552,1377,54,10,Okay.  And do you know what amount did the insurance company pay you on these items that were on the scrapped list?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
553,1380,54,13,I don't recall that number.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,1381,54,14,Okay.  Were any of these items subject to negotiation where you and the insurance company went back and forth on any particular item?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
555,1385,54,18,"Not on a line by line, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
556,1386,54,19,Okay.  Was there any discussion on a general basis of what you would be paid on the scrapped items?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

What I will do or Gus will do is send you a copy of that transcript so that you can review it.  You'll also get something called an errata sheet.  So if the court reporter transcribed anything incorrectly, like say it was John Smith but she put John Goth or something, you can then change that name to the correct name that it is, sign that errata sheet, send it back to us.  If you don't see there's any errors, then you can just email one of us and tell us there's no errors, no errata sheet is necessary.",side_chat,MR. GOGINENI,start_chat

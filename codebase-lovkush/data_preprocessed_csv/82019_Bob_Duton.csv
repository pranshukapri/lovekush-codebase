201,617,23,23,"When you say them, who do you mean?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
202,619,23,25,"I mean Case Managers.  There is also support staff so that there would be -- on our team, we'll have an outcome specialists, we have a Case Aide.  Sometimes we have aftercare workers.  Those are all support staff.  Their role is to support the Case Managers.  In a way, everything supports the Case Managers.  We have to look at quality.  We have to look at compliance.  All of those issues that go in terms of Case Management.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,630,24,10,"And when you say compliance, compliance with what?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
204,632,24,12,"Compliance with the agency's and DHS's expectations of what needs to be done for good practice, meeting the timelines for some of the documentation that needs to be done on a case, the quality of the work that's being done, making sure you keep an eye, you're overseeing these cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,639,24,19,Would that be following the CUA Practice Guidelines?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
206,641,24,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,642,24,22,You mentioned an Outcome Specialist.  What role does the Outcome Specialist play?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
208,645,24,25,"It's a support role.  They do things that are in support to the Case Manager. They may supervise a visit.  They may be get documents.  They may take things to the parents.  They may provide transportation for children or families.  They put documents into records.  Things that, you know, just tasks that will support and help Case Management.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,654,25,8,"And we say supervised visits, do you mean visits between the children and the parent?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
210,657,25,11,"Parent and child, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,658,25,12,Would they accompany the Case Manager on home visits or placement visits?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
212,660,25,14,"They could, but it's not a main part of their job.  If two staff were needed, sure they would, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,663,25,17,What are some examples of when two staff would be needed?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
214,665,25,19,"If you were trying to transport a child or multiple children or if a child was demonstrating behavorial problems.  If there was a support person that could speak different languages, you might do that for interpretation, those kinds of things.  But it's not a main part of the -- accompanying the Case Manager is not a major part of the job.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
215,674,26,2,You also mentioned aftercare staff.  What does aftercare staff --,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
216,676,26,4,"Aftercare is a voluntary service that felt it would be, instead of just closing the case, that you could offer service, you know, just sort of follow-up services.  So you ask a family when their case is ready to be closed whether or not they would like to have a staff touch base with them, check in with them, follow up to make sure things are going okay with school, is there any problem with therapy, whatever the focus of the case was.  If they say they would like those services, then we would visit them on a prescribed basis, whatever was agreed upon, and it's a voluntary service for the families and children.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
217,690,26,18,Would the Case Aide have a similar role as the Outcome Specialist?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
218,692,26,20,"Yes.  We talk about it a lot.  A lot of it overlaps.  There are certain other sort of distinct things that they do.  For example, an Outcome Specialist doesn't request the birth certificates or the social security cards.  So things like that that are just for the Case Aide to do.  But in many other areas there are overlaps.  They put records in the files, they can go out and supervise visits. They can do a number of similar things to the Outcome Specialist.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
219,704,27,6,Do you remember working with any of these support staffs on Taj'anae Siler's case?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
220,707,27,9,I did not.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,708,27,10,"As a supervisor, did you have regular meetings with your Case Managers or do you have regular meetings with your Case Managers?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

223,715,27,17,What's the difference between an individual meeting and team meetings in terms of what's discussed?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
224,718,27,20,"The individual meetings would be much more focused on the case, on the individualized cases.  That's where you would really work with the Case Managers on their cases.  A team meeting is going to be more general.  It will get at policies and procedures.  It's going to get at team work issues or scheduling issues, general practice issues, those kinds of things.  We really wouldn't be doing individual look at cases in a group.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,730,28,6,"When you do an individual look at cases, what are you looking for as the supervisor?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
226,733,28,9,"Well, I'm looking for the quality of the work.  I want to see that they are doing the work that they are supposed to be doing.  I'm looking at the relationship they have with the family.  I'm looking at compliance, you know.  Have they seen the child, have they assessed for safety, do they know the services that the child is involved with and are they following up, did they get their assessments done in the prescribed timeframes?  All of those things go in to --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,744,28,20,And then I'm guessing you would make recommendations based on where they were meeting those guidelines or not meeting those guidelines?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
228,748,28,24,"Yeah.  We would talk about the direction moving forward.  These are the things that need to get done, this is the direction that we're going.  You're always -- I mean, as I said in the beginning, you're always looking at the safety issues, is this child safe? You're always looking at where we are going in terms of permanency because you're dealing with the law.  The law says that the child needs a permanent -- there needs to be movement towards permanency.  So we're working on permanency all the time.  So depending on the case, where are we in terms of establishing some kind of permanent situation for that child.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,763,29,13,"And as a supervisor, to make that determination about permanency, what are you relying on?  Documents, conversations?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
230,766,29,16,"Yeah.  I mean, you're relying on the conversation, you're relying on the, say, the family's compliance with things.  You have court oversight so that you've got the tools. The tools of the work have to do with the court and what the court is asking, say, of the family and of the CUA or of anybody that's working towards the permanency for this case. Plus, you also have a Single Case Plan.  That's to be developed for each family, and it's generally every six months that you have that plan.  That's supposed to be for everybody to be on the same page as to where this case is moving forward.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,781,30,5,So the Single Case Plan would have the goals for the family?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
232,783,30,7,"Yeah.  The goals, objectives to work on, yes, and the child if they are over 14.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,786,30,10,"So the child, parents or caretakers of the --",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
234,788,30,12,"They are invited to this meeting, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,790,30,14,So there is a meeting to develop this Single Case Plan?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
236,792,30,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,793,30,17,"And you said that's updated every six months, is that what you said?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
238,795,30,19,"Yes.  Back in 2016, we were having those conferences every three months. That's changed to every six months.  The expectation is that the Single Case Plan had to be done every six months.  It could be done at that three month time if there was a significant change, but generally it would be every six months.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,804,31,2,How soon after a case was assigned to the CUA would a Single Case Plan be developed?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
240,807,31,5,"It doesn't happen -- it was a little slow at times as we were trying to figure it out.  The permanency teaming meetings are run by DHS so they schedule them.  In general, I would say within three to four weeks it would happen, plus or minus.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,813,31,11,"When you say it, do you mean the teaming meeting or the plan?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
242,815,31,13,The teaming meeting to develop the goals and objectives for the plan.  Then the Case Manager and the Case Management Supervisor have ten days to put that into writing for the Single Case Plan.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
243,820,31,18,"So within a month of receiving the case, usually there would be a Single Case Plan?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
244,823,31,21,In general.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,824,31,22,Was this set by any requirements by DHS or the agency's policies?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
246,826,31,24,"My understanding is that they're supposed to have it within about three weeks. In practice, it is when it is and then we have ten days, CUA has ten days, to get it in place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,831,32,3,So would it affect your ability to provide CUA Services if you didn't have the Single Case Plan?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
248,834,32,6,"Not really.  You develop a tentative plan the day you get the case.  In terms of reading the case, you would want to know what you think is going on.  You're already getting information in the referral that comes through DHS.  They are in a way prescribing some things that look like we're going to move forward with, and then we're making contact with the child, we're trying to make contact with the parent.  So you're already gathering information that you're really going to bring to the Single Case Plan teaming meeting.  You're already working the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,848,32,20,"And when you say you, do you mean the Case Manager?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
250,850,32,22,Yeah.  Under direction of the Case Manager and supervisor.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,852,32,24,Just to go back a second.  You talked about individual and team meetings with the Case Managers; is that right?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
252,856,33,2,In terms of the teaming meetings?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,858,33,4,"Correct.  Oh, no, no.  Just supervision meetings.",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
254,860,33,6,"Oh, supervision.  Yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
255,861,33,7,About how often would you have the individual supervision meetings?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
256,863,33,9,"You try to do it weekly.  You probably average, you know -- I don't mean weekly.  You try to do it a little bit more often, but it's probably monthly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,867,33,13,"The group meetings with the Case Managers, about how often would they happen?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
258,869,33,15,"The agency would like them to happen every month.  My team, we average probably every other month.  It's very difficult.  Our staff are all over in the field.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,874,33,20,"You mentioned talking about different, like, policies or practice pointers in those meetings.  What is an example of one of those?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
260,878,33,24,"Say there is a new guideline that comes down from DHS, we would review that. If there is an internal policy change with Catholic Community Services, we would look at that.  We are tracked by DHS.  So there is what they call a scorecard.  We're always looking at scorecard issues because that's sort of a barometer of how we're doing. If we get a high score, that's a way to say thank you to the staff.  If we get a lower score, it's, like, all right, how are we going to address this and how are you thinking about this?  How can we do this as a team, how do we correct something along?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,893,34,13,So the scorecard is developed by DHS?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
262,895,34,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,896,34,16,Does the scorecard measure compliance with DHS requirements?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
264,898,34,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,899,34,19,"Is it, like, an A to F scale?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
266,900,34,20,"It's a 0, 1, or 2 scale.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,901,34,21,What does one represent on the scale?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
268,903,34,23,Partial compliance.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,904,34,24,So I guess --,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
270,905,34,25,"For example, Single Case Plan is developed, one point.  Single Case Plan is done within the ten day timeframe, two points. Single Case Plan isn't done within the ten day timeframe, then you're going to get a one.  If there is no Single Case Plan, zero.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,912,35,6,So the different areas of where the CUA is graded is on this scorecard?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
272,914,35,8,"Many areas, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,915,35,9,You talked about the Single Case Plan has one type of document that you would review as a Case Manager.  Are there any other types of documents the Case Managers would create that you would review as a supervisor?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
274,920,35,14,"Yeah.  Many documents.  You have the Single Case Plan, every note that they enter in -- it's an electronic record -- every note that they enter into the record has to be reviewed and approved by the Case Management Supervisor.  Their assessments, there is a risk assessment, safety assessment.  There is a FAST.  There is a CANS.  There are four main assessment tools that have to be reviewed. If there is a safety plan that's needed, that also has to be signed off by the Case Management Supervisor.  There is a number of referable actions that we take that have to be -- that can't move forward without approval by the Case Management Supervisor.  It could be prevention services for a placement.  All of those referrals need Case Management Supervisor approval.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,939,36,7,"And all these documents, you said they were electronic?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
276,941,36,9,"No.  The Single Case Plan, the structure progress notes, which are the notes that the workers put in about their contacts with any client or if they get collateral information, like, an e-mail or something that's relevant to the case, they are going to put that in there.  The risk assessment, the safety assessment, they are all -- CANS and the FAST, they are all documents that are in there. The CUA provider referral is in there, referrals for prevention services. There are some referables for, like, in adoption cases.  The SWAN Referral is a paper. It's a paper referral that a case management supervisor signs off on and then is forwarded. Then that gets uploaded as a document into the file.  But some of them are, you know, the forms.  The only way you can address the forms is on the electronic record.  For example, if a worker goes out and sees a child in a foster home, they come back and they have to write a note about that contact.  It's a structured note.  It's the same note for every entry. They finish that off and then it sits in a queue for me or for the Case Management Supervisor to approve.  It sits there until a Case Management Supervisor approves it and puts it into the record.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,970,37,12,"When the Case Managers do these visits, they also have to complete notes for seeing children in a placement facility?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
278,973,37,15,"Yes, they do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,974,37,16,"So you mentioned foster homes, placement facilities, I guess, also if they went to the parent's home to visit the child?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
280,977,37,19,"Yes.  For in-home cases, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,978,37,20,About how long after they make the visit do they need to complete the note?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
282,980,37,22,"Well, they say within six days. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,982,37,24,What affects whether it happens or it does not happen?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
284,985,38,1,"The workers dedication to the job.  Their organization, their schedule, what interferes with getting it done, a variety of things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

290,1002,38,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1003,38,19,When would you make those kinds of visits?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
292,1005,38,21,"I would do it to -- if I had a worker that was out and I needed to cover.  So someone calls up sick and they had an appointment and it needed to be done, you would go into a situation like that.  You would go when a worker said, I'm having a difficult time with this family.  I want another person with me when I go.  Very occasionally, it would be for, like, a safety concern if someone was concerned.  It might be that it's a complicated case or sensitive issue that needs to addressed with the family and they want some additional support.  You know, if as an agency we felt like we needed an extra pair of eyes on a family situation, we would do that.  It's not a regular part of the job, but it certainly can happen.  Sometimes it's just to meet the families.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

298,1032,39,22,"Well, it could be various.  One would be to cover the case.  If I had a worker that's out or if, say, a worker changed, if I had been working a case with a worker for over a year and then that person resigned and took another job and then I have a brand new Case Manager who has only been on that case for a month, I would go to court and I would testify. I would go out to see that family and the child or that child because that's the safety -- I would see the child so I could testify to safety. Then I would go and present the case for our agency in court.  I would go to support, like, a new staff person that's just learning the ropes in court.  We're going to prep for court.  Then I'm going to go with him or her to support them in court.  My role in that situation could be to supplement what the Case Manager is saying because I have continuity with the case.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

310,1083,41,21,"Personnel.  You know, what's going on with the staff on the team, any issues that I might have, how they are doing positively and negatively.  You would talk about anything that's new related to policies and procedures, and you would, depending on what we're -- so there could be problematic cases that needed to be reviewed.  Although, often times those get reviewed in between. Those situations don't wait.  Often it's to really focus, give you time to sit back and think on, like, the permanency issue.  Like, which cases are headed towards adoption, which cases are working to be reunified with their families, are there systemic things that are going on here that we need to address to move this process along.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I got a call one day just from him because when I was at Saint Francis and we had a lot of dealings with CBH.  This is an employee for that system that has been around a long time, knows me, and knew I was at Catholic Community Services.

The supervisor and the worker were not in the agency.  I fielded that call.  I don't recall exactly what I did, but what I would have done was inform them who the supervisor is, who the worker is, what the status is about those things so that the system knew, you know, they were reaching out to our agency to get some contact.

336,1179,45,13,"I think he was just a problem solver.  If there was something going on that was creating some difficulty, he was a problem solver.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
337,1183,45,17,What are some examples of problems that would arise with the RTF that CBH would get involved?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
338,1186,45,20,"They could be any number of things.  One could be clarity about where we are with evaluations, what somebody is recommending, what's happening with the authorization process because services with CBH have to be prior authorized.  Sometimes negotiating those issues, like, where is it in the system.  He could problem solve those things.  Sometimes you have to have somebody outside the system to dig in a little bit to find out, like, what's going on procedurally.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
339,1198,46,6,What's involved in the authorization process that you mentioned?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
340,1200,46,8,For RTF?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,1201,46,9,Yes.,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
342,1202,46,10,"Well, RTF is a specialized program and it requires medical necessity.  So for a young person to receive RTF Services, there has to be a psychiatric evaluation indicating the medical necessity for RTF Services.  That means that a psychiatrist has to be located, assessment has to take place, the documentation has to be written, and if it recommends medical necessity for RTF Services, then that's the document that then has to go to CBH.  CBH then has to approve that. I believe the CBH process is that two doctors have to approve it. Basically, you're going to have the referring doctor and the medical director looking at that and making a decision as to whether or not RTF Services are going to be in place.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,1220,47,2,"When you say medical director, who employees this medical director?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

346,1225,47,7,For RTF?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,1226,47,8,Yeah.,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
348,1227,47,9,"Ensuring that the evaluations were done in the timeframes so that if you were looking for continued RTF Services, that the evaluation was done within the timeframes, the evaluation met the standards, and that medical necessity was indicated.  Then that document and all supporting paperwork would go to CBH.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
349,1234,47,16,"After medical necessity was found and CBH also approved, what would be the next step in the process?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
350,1237,47,19,CBH would locate an RTF placement.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
351,1239,47,21,"When you say RTF, would that be a Residential Treatment Facility?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
352,1241,47,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
353,1242,47,24,"How would that facility differ from, for instance, the residential program you had under your supervision at Saint Francis?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
354,1246,48,2,"Well, the easiest way is to say there is more support.  The support is more clinical support.  The therapist is going to -- an example would be, in the residential program you might have an outpatient therapist, and the child would go to see the outpatient therapist. In an RTF Program, that therapist would meet with the child more than once.  Outpatient would be once a week. In RTF, a child might see the therapist two to three times a week.  The therapist would be part of the team and go to the team meetings.  The therapist would have a relationship with the staff, a close relationship with the staff, so that there is a much more intense team work approach in RTF. It's designed to be therapeutic.  It's designed to support the child with the needs as identified by the psychiatric evaluation. It was determined that they need, like, the clinical services.  They need the support of mill youth therapy that goes with an RTF.  The psychiatric oversight is more intense in terms of medication and regular contact with the psychiatrist.  For example, if it was in the residential program, the child might only see the psychiatrist every six months.  In a residential program, that child is going to see the psychiatrist every month. Those are examples.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
355,1277,49,7,"And then just to go back to the phone call that you mentioned from Mr. Zechiel, is it?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
356,1280,49,10,Zechiel.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
357,1281,49,11,"Other than trying to figure out the contact person at the agency for Ms. Siler, did you discuss anything else with him?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

359,1289,49,19,"Before this phone call, had you previously dealt with the Bridge on other cases?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
360,1292,49,22,"Not while I was at the CUA.  I'm sure over the years I had dealings, but the Bridge program has changed over the years.  I had contact with the Bridge, but not recently. I mean, I have had contact since, but from when I started as a CUA Supervisor until this incident with the situation which Tim called me, I had no contact with the Bridge.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
361,1301,50,5,You said the regular Case Manager and supervisor were not at the agency that day?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

372,1326,51,4,I don't know.  I don't think so. I think my communication on this was e-mail.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
373,1328,51,6,You mentioned touching the case at another instance as well.  What do you recall about that?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
374,1331,51,9,"Well, what I recall about that was Theresa Hamlett came to me when the medical examiners office had called her when they had located Taj'anae or they figured out -- they had Taj'anae.  They just couldn't figure out what the connection was.  They made the connection to Theresa and she hadn't been in the position a long time.  I don't know how long she had been in the position. She was also -- this was a totally new situation for her and she recently had a death, something in her family. Emotionally it was hard for her so she came to me and I helped her.  I supported her in terms of what needed to be done in that situation.  I just know that -- I mean, I knew what needed to be done in terms of notification.  I made sure that we notified our chain of command, the DHS chain of command, so that everybody was up-to-date. I made sure that we were documenting everything that was happening, worked with her to setup the time for the medical examiners office to come talk to her so that there could be some identification confirmation.  Then it continued in terms of support.  We went to the family with the medical examiner out to the mom's house.  Then Theresa and I went to Taj'anae's funeral. That's the basic outline of what I did in that situation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
375,1363,52,15,Who was involved in the agency's chain of command that you mentioned?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
376,1365,52,17,"That would have been Alan Speed and Theresa Thompson, our administrator, James Black, who is the CSS Administrator that oversees our program, and I'm sure I put James Amado on there.  He is head of -- I don't know his exact title, he's CSS.  He's over Jim Black.  He's the top person for us in terms of social services at Catholic Social Services.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

380,1380,53,6,"I'm just going to -- probably Kim Ali.  I know for sure I would send it to her.  It could have been Stacey Boyd, possibly. I think Shapiro and maybe Figueroa.  I'd have to look at my e-mail to know, but those are the top people that would have -- some of those people I notified.  Probably most of them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
381,1387,53,13,Were you communicating with the DHS chain of command through e-mail or phone?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

I'm just gathering this from e-mails.  I mean, I've seen a lot of cases.  So, you know, when you see certain things, it triggers thinking about the system and where she could best be helped.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question

550,1815,69,25,Is there a reason you did not include Selara Harris on this e-mail?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

571,1867,71,25,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
572,1869,72,1,What is a subcontractor referral?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
573,1871,72,3,"Subcontractor referral, the subcontractor in this case is the Bridge so that, you know, the payment for services goes from basically DHS/CUA to the Bridge.  So the subcontractor referral is our communication tool about the case to the subcontractor.  In this case, the Bridge.  It's a standard form in the system, which the Case Manager would fill out or Case Management Supervisor would fill out, whoever.  That's a referral that gets approved in our system, Case Manager, Case Management Supervisor, Case Management Director, then that gets sent down to the DHS CRU.  They would make the connection to the Bridge.  Once it's approved and accessible to us, to the CUA, we might be able to send it to the Bridge, but it's not our -- it's really the DHS responsibility in the referral process to get that to the Bridge or the placement agency.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
574,1890,72,22,Does the CUA typically send the referral to the placement agency or does DHS?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
575,1892,72,24,It's DHS that sends the referable.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
576,1895,73,1,"So the CUA completes the form, sends it to DHS, then DHS would send it to the placement facility?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
577,1898,73,4,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
578,1899,73,5,Typically how long does it take for the placement referral or the subcontractor referral to be completed?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
579,1902,73,8,"Anywhere from an hour to a day. When these situations happen, there is time pressures and it gets done.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
580,1905,73,11,Would it be unusual for it to take two or three months for a subcontractor referral to be completed?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
581,1908,73,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
582,1909,73,15,What is the purpose on the side of the facility of having the subcontract referral?  How does that help them?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
583,1912,73,18,"It provides demographic information about the client, the client's family, information about court, information about attorneys.  It explains basically the origin of the case.  Then there is a history. There is ways to explain the child's circumstances, what's going on, what needs to be addressed, what restrictions there are, all of those situations.  In that case, the Bridge would understand that, you know, a little bit about our placement history, about what's been going on with the case, what the current situation is.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
584,1926,74,6,So the Bridge would be lacking that information if they did not have access to the referral?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
585,1929,74,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
586,1930,74,10,Would it be a similar situation for the Single Case Plan?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
587,1932,74,12,"The Single Case Plan would be helpful to the case because that outlines the objectives for the family, for the child, and for the CUA.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
588,1936,74,16,"So for instance, in this case, the Bridge wouldn't have access to those goals without having the Single Case Plan?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
589,1939,74,19,"Unless someone talked to them about it, but no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
590,1941,74,21,"Then the next sentence reads, they were not done so I said that Case Manager had to get them to her.  As you have seen, I did send the DRO.  What does DRO stand for?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
591,1945,74,25,"It stands for Dependency Review Order, which no longer exist.  They still call it that.  It's the Permanency Review Order from family court.  Whenever there is a court case and court hearing, the DRO is the document that you're given at the end of the court hearing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
592,1952,75,6,I'm guessing this lists court orders for certain child or family?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
593,1954,75,8,"It explains what the -- it addresses permanency.  The most important thing for that is what the court is expecting from the child, the agency, or the family.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
594,1958,75,12,"You mentioned how the Case Manager would have to send those documents. Other than the DRO to the Bridge, is the Case Manager the usual point of contact for document request from a facility?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
595,1963,75,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
596,1964,75,18,Do you know why those forms were not completed at that time?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

598,1967,75,21,Was Selara Harris the employee assigned to complete those forms?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
599,1969,75,23,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
600,1970,75,24,Were those forms supposed to have been completed before this point?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
601,1973,76,1,I'm going to assume yes since I wrote it this way.  The subcontractor referral would get done as her discharge from the hospital was imminent.  So it could have been right around the time that it was happening. That could have been a problem because she was on vacation.  It might have been something that had to have been done while she was vacation. I don't know.  I don't know the timing.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
602,1982,76,10,"Is there, like, a normal process or procedure for covering Case Managers cases when they are on vacation?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
603,1985,76,13,"I would say there is no formal procedure for that.  Mostly, in general, I think it tends to fall to the Case Management Supervisor.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
604,1989,76,17,So the supervisor would be the person responsible for making sure the tasks are being completed on the cases?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
605,1992,76,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
606,1993,76,21,"Did Ms. Hamlett, Theresa Hamlett, reach out to you before Selara Harris went on vacation to ask with your help covering cases?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
607,1997,76,25,"No.  Let me modify that.  We have a general -- we try to support each other in terms of the Case Management Supervisors. If Theresa was out on vacation, she would of let us know that she was out and let her staff know that they need to go to alternate Case Management Supervisors.  I don't know in this situation.  I don't know what the circumstances were in terms of staff being out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
608,2007,77,9,"Then in the next paragraph you write, my recommendation would be for Selara to get to the Bridge next week to see Taj'anae in preparation for court on 7/25/16.  How did you develop that recommendation?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
609,2012,77,14,"Well, I don't know where this is, but Taj'anae was going to the Bridge.  So when that placement takes place, it's our responsibility as a Case Manager to get out and see her in her new placement even though she had been there before.  In addition, because I had some involvement with the case, I noticed that the next court date was 7/25.  It's really important that the worker sees the child in the placement to be able to testify to safety in court.  I was just trying to be supportive to Theresa in terms of something that came to mind when I was covering, you know.  I picked up on this case to help out.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
610,2027,78,3,One of the purposes of doing the visits to the placement would be to assess the child's safety?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

618,2042,78,18,What are some examples of those cases?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
619,2044,78,20,"It could be that there is, like, a visit that needs to be supervised by the Case Manager or a staff person and they would go to a facility to do that.  If there was a planning meeting scheduled that the Case Manager could get to, they might go to the facility and see the child when they are there.  It could be that there is a crisis and you would want to go there to support your child or to support the staff.  You know, just good case management decisions.

621,2060,79,10,Yes.  That could happen.  It could be in a foster home.  It could be the child lives with the maternal grandmother and you don't want to move the child.  You say the visit can take place in the home with a CUA worker there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
622,2066,79,16,You also mentioned if there is a crisis.  What are some examples of a crisis when you say that?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

624,2074,79,24,Would that include self-harming or threats of --,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

626,2081,80,5,So that type of decision would be left up to Selara Harris in this case?,q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer

It can come in different directions.  There is no set procedure for that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

662,2161,83,7,"When you say her worker in reference to Ms. Harris, who do you mean?",q,MR. NOCHO,start_answer
663,2163,83,9,"All right.  So Selara Harris is responsible for developing the Single Case Plan.  She could send it to the Bridge.  If she doesn't send it to the Bridge, then it would then bump up to the Case Management Supervisor and make sure that it gets done.  She could ask someone to send it.  She could send it herself.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

675,2195,84,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
676,2196,84,16,"So it's an e-mail dated July 18, 2016, from Ms. Kwanty to you.  It says, Leona was denied by CHOY.  They will send to CHOR. They aren't sending any right now, don't know why.  She was also denied by Carson Valley.  Do you know who Leona is?",q,MR. HILL,start_answer

678,2203,84,23,Who?,q,MR. HILL,start_answer
679,2204,84,24,"My best guess about this, and I can't answer the question, is that at the same time there was things going on with Taj'anae, there were things going on with another client on my caseload, Leona.  She was looking for -- they were looking for an RTF Program for her. I can't tell you that this is related to Taj'anae.  This could fully be related to Leona.  It could have just been crossed.  Just a mix up in terms of communication about cases.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
680,2215,85,9,Was Leona --,q,MR. HILL,start_answer
681,2216,85,10,"There is something that's not correct about this.  It's either Leona was wrongly put in there and that meant Taj'anae, but I don't believe that that's the case.  Then it helps clarify things about CHOR and the Children's Home of York.  I think that may have been more related to Leona.  If you understand. You know what I'm saying?",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

686,2235,86,3,"My best guess, Leona, but I'm not sure.  It makes more logical sense to me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

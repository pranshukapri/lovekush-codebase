So my intention is to take your deposition as the corporate representative and also take your personal deposition at the same time so that we can save time for the parties. What I will do in order to accommodate that is if I am asking a question where I expect a response from the Rotary Club of Houston, I will indicate that I'm asking, ""What would Rotary's position be with regard to such and such?""  If I'm asking for your personal opinion or your personal testimony, I will say, ""Mr. Meeks, what is your personal opinion or your personal testimony?""",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

40,258,9,11,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
41,259,9,12,And I want to say two or three times in my career.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

43,263,9,16,I am.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
44,264,9,17,"I ask the question.  You give the answer.  I try to let you finish your answer before I interrupt you.  You try to let me finish the question before you start the answer.  It's hard for people to do that.  It's hard for me to do that, but I'll try -- I'll do my best. If you need a break at any point, that's certainly fine.  Just let me know.  We can stop. My only request is that we don't do that when there's a question pending.  So let's go ahead and finish out the answer to the question before we take the break.  If you do need to take a break to talk to Mr. Garvin about anything, that's also certainly fine.  But we'll -- Mr. Garvin and I will then need to have a little bit of a discussion about that once you come back.  So --",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

47,285,10,12,"I have.  And just so everybody is on the same page, you know that Mr. Meeks has had some health problems.  And he's still confronting them, but he's a lot better. But he just -- there may be times he needs to take a pause because of those.",side_chat,MR. GARVIN,start_question
48,291,10,18,"(BY MR. TODD)  Certainly.  If at any point you don't feel well, you need a break, just let us know.  It's perfectly acceptable.  We do understand, and we're happy to accommodate that. So in order to prepare for this deposition, did you -- did you meet with anybody or did you look at any documents?  What did you do to prepare?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
49,300,11,1,"I've looked at some of the documents that Mike has provided.  I've spoken with Mike.  I did not talk to anybody else about this deposition, what I should say or what anybody else has said or any of those kinds of things at all.  I didn't think that would have any bearing on how I would respond to your questions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
50,307,11,8,"Okay.  So documents that you reviewed, were they -- did you happen to know if they were documents that were produced or not produced in the proceeding?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
51,311,11,12,Mike would have to tell you that because they're in his email that he sent to me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
52,313,11,14,Okay.  Do you recall if they had a number in the bottom right-hand corner?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
53,315,11,16,"No, I don't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
54,316,11,17,Okay.  Did you assist Mr. Garvin or his team with the preparation of responses to discovery requests in this matter?,q,MR. TODD,start_chat

56,322,11,23,Not that I recall.  So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,323,11,24,(BY MR. TODD)  Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
58,324,11,25,"-- I don't think we've had much discussion at all really, just given the situation that I've been through personally.  I've had my foot off the gas in this matter pretty extensively.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,329,12,4,It would have been probably some time ago that these requests were served.  And we need -- we just want to make sure that we understand who was sort of responsible for helping Mr. Garvin gather the information.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
60,334,12,9,"I did -- I did have a spreadsheet put together and provided it to Mike in answer to one of the questions.  So that I know specifically. If there were discussions on the phone or something like that, they were not extensive or long in nature.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,340,12,15,Do you recall generally what the spreadsheet contained?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
62,342,12,17,"Yeah, it contained revenue figures for the Lombardi Award event going back to -- five or six years at least.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,345,12,20,Okay.  Did you gather any documents to assist Rotary Club in its proceeding here?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
64,347,12,22,"No, I didn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,348,12,23,Okay.  Do you have any documents now that are relevant to the proceeding?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
66,350,12,25,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,352,13,1,Do you know how the Rotary Club of Houston maintains its documentation with regard to the Lombardi Award?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
68,355,13,4,"I know that we have a storeroom in a storage facility.  And I've never been there.  So, you know, I -- I didn't have a key for most of the time that I was president of the Club.  I transitioned out of being president at the end of June.  I gave that key to our current president. But I've never been to that storage room or was, you know, personally aware of anything that was in it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,364,13,13,Okay.  Are there electronic storage mechanisms or devices that the Rotary Club of Houston uses?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
70,367,13,16,"I assume that there's -- there's -- some of that material exists, but I'm not personally aware of it.  I haven't been involved in it.  I mean, the Club administrator would know more about that than I.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,372,13,21,Okay.  Who is the current Club administrator?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
72,374,13,23,"Her name is Dena -- give me a minute.  I'll member her last name.  We can get you the name. Dena -- gosh, brain cramp.  Sorry.  It will come to me in a couple of minutes, I'm sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,379,14,2,"Some of the documents that we have in this case are quite old.  They date back to the '70s, for example.  Do you know how the Rotary Club of Houston would have stored those types of documents or how they would have been found?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
74,384,14,7,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,385,14,8,Do you know if the Rotary Club of Houston has a documentation retention policy?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
76,387,14,10,"Not that I'm aware of.  I think there's a lot of enthusiasm and interest in it, but it's more of a grassroots by member -- by member kind of thing.  So there isn't any stated policy or -- or structure that governs that that I'm aware of.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,392,14,15,"Okay.  And the Club administrator, she would be the person that would most likely be the person responsible for maintaining records in your opinion?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
78,396,14,19,"Not necessarily.  And I'm not trying to make this difficult.  It's just that we have -- we have a number of people in the Club that are currently or formerly in the Club that have amassed, you know, mementos and different things that go with the history of the Club. So I know Phil Hampton might have some of that kind of material.  I don't know specifically what he has.  I know that Angie Jimenez, who used to be with the Club and no longer is, is -- and this is all just hearsay, but widely discussed that -- that he took a lot of documentation with him and so on, not necessarily about this matter, but just stuff that he felt was his more than it was the Club's.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,412,15,9,Sure.  Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
80,413,15,10,So --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,414,15,11,"When there's a transition from -- from one president to the next, is there a process involved, or how does that happen?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
82,417,15,14,"It -- it -- all of Rotary -- Rotary International, every Rotary Club gets new leadership on July 1st of every year.  And the vast majority of what is attended to in that transition is -- has to do with renewing memberships.  So while the Club gets completely new leadership, the Club also has to get all of its members renewed on that same date. The -- the big thing that overarches pretty much anybody's concern to anything else is filing that membership report with Rotary International at midnight on the last day of June.  So, you know, I've been through this twice when I was coming in as president and then going out as president.  It -- it -- it consumes a lot of time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,433,16,4,Okay.  Are there any written guidelines or procedures for a president in terms of what you should do or how you should conduct meetings or what you should do with the board?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
84,437,16,8,"There's probably a ton of that out there in reality.  I'm not sure that it's organized coordinated, consistent.  Different clubs are very willing to publish what they think the duties of officers are, but those are Club publications. Rotary International has a lot of guidelines, and they are all basically crafted to help a new president not fall on their face.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,445,16,16,Does Rotary Club of Houston have any such guidelines?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
86,447,16,18,"Not specifically, not beyond anything that I've already said.  A lot of stuff gets handled by tradition.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,450,16,21,"Okay.  And you raise an important point, sort of a point of order for the deposition.  When I say ""Rotary"" or ""the Club,"" my intention is to refer to the Rotary Club of Houston.  If I'm going to ask you a question about Rotary International, I'll try to say ""Rotary International"" so that we sort of know the difference.  I don't expect very many questions at all, if any, about Rotary International.",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
88,460,17,5,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,461,17,6,"But if I say ""Rotary"" or ""the Club,"" my intention is to mean the Rotary Club of Houston. If you have a question about that, just let me know; and I'll be more specific.",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
90,465,17,10,"All right.  Well, I'll try to keep track of that, because in my mind anytime somebody says ""Rotary,"" it's not the Rotary Club of Houston. It's Rotary, et al.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,469,17,14,Okay.  Then how about --,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
92,470,17,15,So we'll work through it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,471,17,16,We'll work through it.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  Let's talk a little bit about your personal history with Rotary.  When did you first join Rotary?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
94,475,17,20,September of 2013.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,476,17,21,What motivated you to join?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
96,477,17,22,I was invited by a fellow businessman that was -- that had an office in the same office building that I'm in.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,480,17,25,Is your office downtown?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
98,482,18,1,No.  We're in Greenway Plaza.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,483,18,2,"Okay.  So your friend was a member of the downtown -- or the Club that we're talking about here today, the Rotary Club of Houston?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
100,486,18,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,487,18,6,Okay.  What roles have you had in the Club since 2013?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
102,489,18,8,"So I've been a director, which means I've served on the board of directors of the Rotary Club of Houston, which is different than the Foundation.  I think you probably understand that. If you don't, I'd be happy to explain that.  And then I served as president elect and president.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,495,18,14,What years were you president elect?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
104,496,18,15,So my years -- my years as president elect ran from 2017 to 2018.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,498,18,17,So you --,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
106,499,18,18,"Hang on.  Yeah, that's right, 2018.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,500,18,19,So when were you president?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
108,501,18,20,2018 to 2019.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,502,18,21,"And as I understand it, that means that you would then transition to the board of the Rotary Club of Houston Foundation after your president year?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
110,506,18,25,Yes.  Now I'm on that board.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,508,19,1,Okay.  Would your term for the board on the -- of the Foundation be 2019 to 2020?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
112,510,19,3,No.  It runs for three years.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
113,511,19,4,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
114,512,19,5,And it ends with you being the chairman of that board.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
115,514,19,7,Okay.  So you will be chairman of that board in 2022?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
116,516,19,9,"Yeah, I think so.  I think so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
117,517,19,10,Roughly.  Okay.  What were some of the initiatives for Rotary Club of Houston when you were president?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
118,520,19,13,"What do you mean by ""initiatives""?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
119,521,19,14,"What programs did the Rotary Club of Houston put on under your tenure, fundraising programs, events, community?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

121,525,19,18,While you were president.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
122,526,19,19,"So we had a Distinguished Citizen's Award event that's a fundraiser for the Club.  Welcome Wilson, Sr., was our honoree.  We also host a regular monthly schedule of events, like Rotary House Hospitality Night, for example.  We put on a lunch for veterans during -- it's the Veterans Day lunch.  And it's always as close to Veterans Day -- whatever the Thursday is closest to Veterans Day at the Junior League, another of our big events.  We were going to have a golf tournament during my year, but we cancelled that. Gosh, what else?  I'm sure there's some other things, but -- you know, if I had a calendar in front of me or something like that, I could give you an exhaustive list.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
123,542,20,9,Okay.  The -- do you engage -- does the Rotary Club of Houston engage in fundraising for any of these events from outside sources?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

130,552,20,19,People -- people and companies out in the business community.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,554,20,21,"Do you remember there being, like, a primary, like, keynote-type sponsor in your year?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
132,556,20,23,"We typically did not have keynotes.  You know, we had sponsorship levels that people could participate in based on, you know, an ascending or descending amount of money classifying them as a gold, platinum, or silver, that kind of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,562,21,3,Do you remember for your year with the Distinguished Citizen Award who might have been the biggest sponsor?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
134,565,21,6,"There were a number of sponsors in the 3,000-dollar range.  We may have had one person bigger than that.  I don't remember specifically. I'm sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

155,607,22,22,I'm not aware of what the time frame was.  I agreed to be in that foundation only in as much as -- and I conditioned that that I would decide after the first meeting whether or not it was appropriate for me to continue on.  I attended the first board meeting -- what I thought was the first board meeting or assumed was the first board meeting and immediately resigned at the end of that meeting.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

157,619,23,8,"I was asked to be on it, along with a number of other people from the Rotary Club.

165,633,23,22,"Yeah.  Rick Slemaker and Spencer Tillman basically talked to John Lombardi and other -- I'm not even sure who attended the meeting, to be candid with you.

And they talked about what they wanted to do with the Lombardi Award now that Rotary was removed from it in their opinion.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
166,642,24,5,And what was your -- what was your reaction to that at the time?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

168,645,24,8,Why?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

191,686,25,23,Can you be more specific?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
192,687,25,24,Sure.  So does the Rotary Club of Houston collect money for the -- from sponsors for the Lombardi Award dinner?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

197,698,26,9,"That's a specific that I'm unsure of. The -- the money goes into the Foundation because it's a 501(c)(3).

235,775,29,8,Rick Slemaker represented that he communicated with them on a regular basis.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

240,785,29,18,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
241,786,29,19,A great deal of what happened when I was on the committee in Rick Slemaker's year was between Rick and the Lombardi family.  The committee struggled with the lack of transparency.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
242,790,29,23,What does that mean?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
243,791,29,24,It means that there was a lot of representation being made that seemed to be contrary to what the Rotary Club had traditionally done.  There was friction.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
244,796,30,3,"Okay.  When you were on the call with Mr. John Lombardi at the Lombardi Foundation, did he -- did he say anything about that to your memory?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

248,804,30,11,"I'd like to ask you a little bit about the communications on the board about the proceeding. And having already had some testimony about this in this proceeding, I know that there are some concerns about privilege with regard to what is going on at those meetings and how this proceeding is being discussed.  But without revealing any discussion with any attorneys, can you tell me is this dispute discussed in Foundation board meetings?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
249,814,30,21,It's -- it's a topic that comes up.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
250,815,30,22,Is it sort of like a dominant topic?  Is it the primary topic?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
251,817,30,24,"I wouldn't say that.  It -- it is a topic, but there's other things that the Foundation has to pay attention to.  So it's part of -- part of dealing with things.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
252,822,31,3,"Is the Foundation board and the Rotary Club of Houston leadership, are they sort of aligned here?  Like, they sort of -- they all have the same vision of the proceeding generally speaking?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
253,826,31,7,Generally they tend to be aligned. Differences come out in terms of establishing budgets and different amounts of spend for -- for charitable efforts and so on that the Club is involved in.  So I think we fixed a lot of those issues while I was president because we -- we aligned our financial people between the board and the Foundation very nicely.  So that resolved a lot of those discussions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,835,31,16,Are there -- are there written communications between the Foundation board and the Rotary Club of Houston about this dispute?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

Because I don't think it's -- how different people from either place feel about this matter is relevant to the issues that are before the TTAB.  So I'm just going to ask you to limit your questions.

259,858,32,13,"I mean, the truth is I don't -- again, I don't understand why that's relevant.  I mean, there's a legal dispute between parties.  And who makes the decisions is not relevant to the issues before the TTAB.  I just really think it's veering way off the rails.

290,928,35,5,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,929,35,6,"Okay.  I will represent to you that -- that we believe that that's a -- an accurate quote from the actual telegram.  It appears to be what the telegram says.  So with regard to -- let's look at Exhibit No. 4 and that quote.  Having read that, what -- what does that quote mean to you personally?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
292,936,35,13,What that quote means to me is that Mrs. Lombardi authorized the Rotary Club of Houston to use Vince Lombardi's name in putting together a national award.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,940,35,17,"Okay.  When you were -- when you were president -- let me back that up. When you were a member of the committee, was there any discussion about what the nature of your authority would be to use Mr. Lombardi's image?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
294,945,35,22,Not that I'm aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

300,959,36,10,"Yes, I do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

302,964,36,15,She authorized us to use his name.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

318,992,37,17,"No, I don't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
319,993,37,18,"Okay.  The first paragraph of the letter says, ""As you will be president of Rotary during the next Lombardi Award Banquet in 1979, I hope that I may share some of the concerns that have been expressed by some of our American Cancer Society members and by some Rotarian members."" Did I read that correctly?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
320,1000,37,25,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
321,1002,38,1,"Okay.  So it appears that at least Mr. C.D. Tinsley is going to be the next president of Rotary that Mr. Reimann is referring to, at least according to Mr. Reimann, correct?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
322,1006,38,5,It would seem so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
323,1007,38,6,"Okay.  The second paragraph says, ""The first concern is the rather tenuous nature of our original authority for the Rotary Club to sponsor the Lombardi Award Dinner with the proceeds to go to the American Cancer Society.  As you know, we have only a telegram authorizing us to proceed with such dinners.  The success of the dinner indicates that there may very well be additional organizations who would relish the opportunity to put on a similar event."" Did I read that correctly?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
324,1018,38,17,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

326,1023,38,22,"Well, to be candid with you, having just been president of this Club for a year and having encountered so many different opinions in response to a speaker or a topic from so many corners of the room, I read this without having any idea of what the context is, who these people are, what the personalities were that they were exerting over the Club, those kinds of things.  I have absolutely no idea if this letter is pandering or any of those kinds of things.  So it's -- it's really hard to respond to this as -- as anything that would be factual and specific over the general will or tenure of the Club.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
327,1037,39,10,Do you believe the Rotary Club of Houston's authority is tenuous with regard to the award?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

329,1040,39,13,Why not?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
330,1041,39,14,"Because I believe we were given permission to use Lombardi's name, and we built an award around that and presented it for 47 years.  And so you take -- do the math, whatever 1979 is out of that.  You know, this is eight years into it -- seven or eight years into it, and the award continued on well past that.  So I don't see it as tenuous from where I'm sitting.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
331,1049,39,22,"But it appears that perhaps at least Mr. Reimann did, whoever he may be?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

337,1067,40,14,What does the Lombardi name mean to you personally?  What connotation does it have for you?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
338,1070,40,17,"I've always admired Vince Lombardi, the coach, and honored the work that he did.  And I've -- I've also had a great deal of regard and respect for the Lombardi Award.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
339,1074,40,21,"So when you say you admire Vince Lombardi, what -- why?  For what reason?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
340,1076,40,23,"For his coaching skills, his motivational abilities, the way he -- he took in people and made great football players out of them and stood them up as people in the community.  He's just a great example.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
341,1082,41,3,So Coach Lombardi's image is something that Rotary wanted to promote in conjunction with the -- its award?  Is that correct?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
342,1085,41,6,Clearly they wanted his name associated with the award.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
343,1087,41,8,"Because of some of the qualities that you've mentioned, or are there others?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
344,1089,41,10,"That would be assumptive on my part, but yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
345,1091,41,12,Was there ever any discussion at the Rotary Club of Houston while you were either on the committee or as president about why to give the Lombardi Award?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
346,1095,41,16,"No, not -- not that I can specifically recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
347,1097,41,18,Do you know what the Club's motivation would have been to give the award or to continue the award?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
348,1100,41,21,"Well, primarily I would say as a -- as a fundraiser for cancer research.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
349,1102,41,23,"Okay.  So was the -- the primary motivation then for awarding the award would be to raise money for cancer research.  And then would that make the athletic piece a secondary concern, sort of the award to the students?  So what was -- what was primary, and what was secondary?  Or can you classify it that way?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
350,1110,42,5,I've never thought of it that way.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
351,1111,42,6,Okay.  Was it ever discussed?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
352,1112,42,7,"Oh, I don't -- I don't recall anybody ever taking the -- the Lombardi Award apart into its pieces like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
353,1115,42,10,Okay.  Do you associate the Lombardi name with leadership?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
354,1117,42,12,I associate Vince Lombardi with leadership.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
355,1118,42,13,Okay.  Do you associate either Vince Lombardi or the Lombardi family name with integrity?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
356,1121,42,16,I associate Vince Lombardi's name with integrity.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
357,1123,42,18,Okay.  Would you associate the Lombardi name or the Vince Lombardi name with sportsmanship?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
358,1125,42,20,"His name, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
359,1126,42,21,Okay.  Would you associate the Lombardi name -- family name or Vince Lombardi's name with cancer?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
360,1129,42,24,"I associate the award with that, with cancer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
361,1132,43,1,Okay.  How about with cancer research?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
362,1133,43,2,The same answer.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
363,1134,43,3,"Looking back at Exhibit No. 5 at the very last paragraph, it says, ""The third concern"" -- I'm sorry, last paragraph on the first page. Excuse me.  It says, ""The third concern is the need for an established budget approved by appropriate Rotary and American Cancer Society directors."" Do you see that sentence I'm talking about there?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
364,1143,43,12,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
365,1144,43,13,"Okay.  Did the Lombardi Award -- during your tenure either as chair of the committee or as president, was there a budget that was approved for the award?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
366,1148,43,17,"I'm trying to understand what -- in the context of your question and what this is saying what ""an established budget"" actually means.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
367,1151,43,20,"Okay.  So when you were on the committee, was there a budget for the event?  Without reference to this document, just was there a budget for the event?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
368,1155,43,24,That's a hard question to answer because the -- the cost of putting the event on was a dynamic set of variables.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
369,1159,44,2,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
370,1160,44,3,"There -- there was never anything that I was aware of that was a cutoff on how much -- you know, how much we could spend or how much we should spend based on what we needed to spend to put on a great event.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
371,1165,44,8,"Okay.  So were there fundraising targets? Like, you wanted to raise a certain amount of money?  Was there something like that?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
372,1168,44,11,Everybody had a different opinion about how much money could be raised.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
373,1170,44,13,Okay.  And was there somebody keeping an eye on expenses?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
374,1172,44,15,"The cost of putting the event together kind of assembled itself over a span of meetings.  So, you know, where -- where the -- the costs were from month to month was reviewed.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
375,1176,44,19,"Over the course of that sort of performance period, how would you ensure that there was going to be money left to donate; in other words, that the expenses wouldn't consume the fundraiser?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
376,1180,44,23,I'm not sure I understand the question.  I'm sorry.  It's not you.  It's me.  Could you ask me the question again specifically?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
377,1184,45,1,"Sure.  I'm just trying to get an idea of how the committee would have managed a budget -- undefined budget, just a sort of, you know, income in, expenses out process for the award.  In other words, you -- you raised money, you paid expenses, and you had to make a donation to charity.  Is that sort of like the general process?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
378,1191,45,8,"Generally, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
379,1192,45,9,Okay.  So what I'm trying to get at is was there an idea in advance about what that process would look like in terms of fundraising and expense and hopeful donations?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
380,1196,45,13,"Again, it was a dynamic situation the year that I was on the committee and Rick Slemaker was in charge of the event.  The -- there were a lot of differences of opinion on what needed to be a part of the event.  There were differences of opinion on -- and those differences of opinion became more urgent, if you will, based on the cost of those things that were being added to the event. So it tended to be a number of conversations along the line of, ""Why are we doing this this year?  We didn't do it last year.""  ""Why are we not doing something last year"" -- or ""this year that we did do last year and previous years,"" and so on.  So with me being new to that event at that point in time, it was -- there were a number of -- any number of contentious moments where it seemed to me that the amount of money being spent only made sense by people going out and selling more sponsorships, which I think is a natural process.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
381,1217,46,8,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
382,1218,46,9,"But absent the continuity that other people had, it's hard for me to specifically answer your question.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
383,1221,46,12,Did the American Cancer Society have a voice in that process?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
384,1223,46,14,I assume they did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
385,1224,46,15,Okay.  Did you -- but did they ever attend a meeting that you were at?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
386,1226,46,17,There were people on the committee that were responsible for dialoguing with them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
387,1228,46,19,Okay.  Did the Lombardi family have a say in that process?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
388,1230,46,21,I assume they did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
389,1231,46,22,Do you have any personal knowledge that they did?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
390,1233,46,24,"No, I don't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
391,1234,46,25,Okay.  Do you recall during your year on the committee how much money was donated to charity following the event?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
392,1238,47,3,"No, I don't, but it's on the spreadsheet.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
393,1239,47,4,Okay.  Do you have any historical knowledge about donations to charities sort of over time?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
394,1241,47,6,Nothing specific.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
395,1242,47,7,Do you know if there's a trend up or down? Has it been increased -- was it increasing or decreasing?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
396,1245,47,10,"I think the number moved around.  So I can't tell you that -- that -- that -- you know, I -- I personally didn't have a pulse of this.  I was on the committee for one year, and I attended the event that year.  So --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
397,1250,47,15,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
398,1251,47,16,-- somewhat limited knowledge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
399,1252,47,17,And you don't recall how much -- there was no sort of celebration about how much was donated that would spur your memory or --,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
400,1255,47,20,"Yeah, I believe there was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
401,1256,47,21,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
402,1257,47,22,But I don't remember the specifics of it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
403,1258,47,23,And I believe you said that to your knowledge there were no reports made to the Lombardi family about this event.  Is that correct?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
404,1263,48,2,Nothing that I'm specifically aware of.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
405,1264,48,3,I would like to hand you what we will mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 6.,q,MR. TODD,is brackets
406,1266,48,5,(Exhibit 6 marked.),brackets,,start_answer
407,1267,48,6,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
408,1268,48,7,(BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen this document before?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
409,1270,48,9,Not that I recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
410,1271,48,10,"Okay.  At the top it has a -- some version of letterhead, I guess, that says ""Madeline and George Werner"" and a phone number.  Do you know who Madeline Warner is or George Warner?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
411,1275,48,14,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1276,48,15,Have you ever heard of them before?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
413,1277,48,16,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
414,1278,48,17,"Okay.  And then it's addressed to a Mr. Jack Hardison, Executive Vice President, American Cancer Society.  Have you ever heard of Mr. Hardison before?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
415,1282,48,21,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
416,1283,48,22,"Okay.  So the first paragraph of that letter says, ""Since the November 1985 Lombardi Award Dinner, it has been my intention to write to you to reaffirm the Lombardi Family decision to exclusively have the American Cancer Society/Houston the sole recipient of the proceeds of the annual dinner."" Did I read that correctly?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
417,1292,49,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
418,1293,49,6,Do you have any idea why Ms. Werner would need to reaffirm --,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
419,1295,49,8,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
420,1296,49,9,-- permission here --,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
421,1297,49,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
422,1298,49,11,-- or reaffirm the decision?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
423,1299,49,12,No idea.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
424,1300,49,13,Okay.  Is that some indication to you that perhaps prior decisions weren't permanent?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
425,1302,49,15,"No, it really isn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
426,1303,49,16,Okay.,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
427,1304,49,17,"To -- for it to be -- for that to be the case, you'd have to assume that this is some kind of summary document, and I just don't see it that way.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
428,1308,49,21,What do you mean by that?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
429,1309,49,22,"Well, it goes back to my answer on the previous document.  Having come out of being president of this Club for a year and understanding that anybody can write a letter to anybody for any reason, I just don't attach a lot of specific gravity to something that's -- that's not in the context of what's going on at the moment.  I have no idea of what the context was. So I don't know if this letter is straight down the middle of an issue or it comes out of the blue, no idea.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
430,1321,50,8,Is that the same for the communication that's the telegram?  Do you feel the same way about that?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
431,1324,50,11,"No, I think that that's different because it specifically gives the Rotary Club of Houston the right to use Vince Lombardi's name.  And that's more or less reaffirmed in this letter.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1328,50,15,"So the second paragraph says, ""In 1970 when the Rotary Club of Houston called me for permission to use the Lombardi"" -- ""the name Lombardi in conjunction with Lineman of the Year Award dinner in honor of my brother Vince, it never occurred to me that from then to now the proceeds of the dinner would grow to such propositions."" Do you see what I'm pointing to there?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
433,1337,50,24,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
434,1338,50,25,"So she's -- Mrs. Werner, who is the signatory here, is referencing a call from Houston for permission, correct?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
435,1342,51,3,"To use the name Lombardi, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
436,1343,51,4,So is this some kind of a reflection of what was contained in the telegram?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
437,1345,51,6,I see a link to that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1346,51,7,Okay.  And is there any indication in there that this -- this grant -- is she referencing that the grant of permission in here is permanent in some way?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
439,1350,51,11,I don't -- I don't know how to answer that one way or the other.  I don't really infer anything of that kind into this.  It seems to me that this recognizes that they see that having the Rotary Club of Houston create and deploy the Lombardi Award year over year has been very successful.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
440,1357,51,18,And referencing the permission from the family?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
441,1359,51,20,To use the name.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

453,1380,52,15,Is that a website that is maintained by the Rotary Club of Houston?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
454,1382,52,17,I'm not -- I'm not certain if it's currently maintained.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

We've consistently delivered on that charge, raising millions in the process."" Do you see that?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
460,1399,53,8,"Uh-huh, I do.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

462,1401,53,10,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

464,1404,53,13,It's likely that it does.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
465,1405,53,14,Do you believe it accurately reflects the permission that she granted?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

468,1411,53,20,Not necessarily.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

476,1429,54,12,"Well, my -- my interface with -- with what I've just said in my own life is that you hire somebody to write copy for you to put out a publication or to put out a notice and make it interesting, make it powerful, give some -- you know, people that write copy for a living are good at conveying things.  So that's kind of how I read this.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

Every year brings people that have enthusiasm and new ideas that -- if they're new to Rotary, they -- they feel that they can do something to help deal with issues they see as Rotary having too much of or not enough of. They sit and work with people that have been in those situations -- not just the Lombardi Award, but any situation -- that have been doing it that way for 20 years, and it works.  The Rotary constantly deals -- and I mean Rotary International constantly deals with the confluence of new ideas and doing things that work as -- as a historical precedent.  It's part of what makes Rotary a great organization, and it also generates a lot of letters of opinion that come out of nowhere.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
508,1515,57,20,"As the representative of Rotary, are you aware of things that the Rotary Club of Houston could have done to improve the award?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
509,1518,57,23,"I think every single person out there would have an opinion about how things could be done differently, done better, do more of this, not as much of that.  But this is -- this is a process of people working on ideas together year over year. Whether it's -- whether it's the Lombardi Award, whether it's the DCA, whether it's how to get more books into the hands of kids in Houston schools, everybody has got an idea of how to make things better.  And they have an idea of what doesn't work and what should be tried next.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
510,1530,58,9,"Well, were specific ideas for improving the award or the ceremony or the process discussed?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
511,1532,58,11,Can you give me something to anchor that to? Discussed when?  Discussed where?  Discussed --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
512,1534,58,13,"Okay.  So during your tenure on the committee, were there problems or challenges with the event discussed?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
513,1537,58,16,"When I was involved, there were discussions about, ""How can we raise more money?  What can we do better?  What shouldn't we do any more of?"" There were traditions in the award that were attractive to people, as I understood, that, you know, you do certain things in certain ways, and that's attractive.  There were people that wanted to do a bigger dinner.  There were people that didn't want to do dinner at all. So, I mean, basically -- and that's -- and to me that's how Rotary operates.  Every -- every year people talk about how to make the event bigger, better.  They bring their own preferences and experiences.  They compare it to other things that are done. Other people will say, ""This is how we've always done it, and it works really well.  And you can't criticize it.  It raised $300,000 one year,"" you know, that kind of stuff.  So it's just part of the context of being in a volunteer organization that embraces people to participate.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
514,1559,59,12,So the process is sort of inconsistent from year to year?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
515,1561,59,14,I wouldn't say that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
516,1562,59,15,Okay.  But what would be consistent about what you just described?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
517,1564,59,17,"That people come together and get consensus understood, and then people -- so it's -- it's like a family discussion.  Everybody wants something different.  But when you agree on what you're going to do, people lean in and do it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
518,1569,59,22,"But this deliberation process takes place sort of year after year after year in terms of what we're going to do, how we're going to do it?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
519,1572,59,25,"It can, but I don't think that's deleterious to the effort.  I think that's what engages people.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
520,1576,60,3,But does the effort change from year to year?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
521,1578,60,5,"It can move back and forth a little bit. The last event was -- was different in some ways from previous events because it did not involve a meal and it took place in an auditorium rather than a ballroom.  So, I mean, the -- the -- there's -- there's a willingness to try new things and innovate and improve and advance the award, as -- the same thing with Distinguished Citizen or with the Veterans Day Lunch. You know, just for context, I'm in charge of it this year.  I was president over it last year. We have a number of the same people helping out again this year that want to do things the way they used to do, and there's people that want to do things differently.  You find ways to incorporate those issues so that enthusiasm is maintained and people get engaged.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
522,1595,60,22,Is there a different chair of the Lombardi Committee every year?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
523,1597,60,24,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
524,1598,60,25,"And that different chair, they have their own vision of sort of how the event should proceed?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
525,1602,61,3,I think that's too polarizing to say that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
526,1603,61,4,Did you have your own vision of how the event should proceed when you were chair?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
527,1605,61,6,I had enthusiasm for -- I was never chair of the event.  Did you just ask me that?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

533,1614,61,15,I was just a participant in the committee.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

535,1616,61,17,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
536,1617,61,18,"Excuse me.  So while you were a member of the committee, were you aware that the chair had their own vision of sort of how the event should proceed?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
537,1621,61,22,"I think that everybody had preferences for how they would change it, how they would grow it, but I don't want to -- I don't want to substantiate your question, if it's being asked in the context of, ""Was it different every year?  Was it reimagined every year?  Was"" -- ""was it"" -- ""was there no consistency or congruity?"" That was -- there was.  There was consistency.  There were -- there were congruous elements of that from one year to the next, if that's the right word.  People were interested in making it better, making it bigger, and -- and -- and with enthusiasm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
538,1635,62,10,"In the year that you were involved, were there celebrity speakers?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

540,1638,62,13,Who was that?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
541,1639,62,14,"I'm trying to recall.  I think that -- gosh, that's all on record.  It's really hard for me to call up names.  I'm sorry.  But, yes, there were. There were some celebrity speakers.  And my understanding of their participation was they were secured by Axiom for that event.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
542,1645,62,20,Was there national broadcast coverage of the event?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
543,1647,62,22,I don't think there was.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
544,1648,62,23,Were there guidelines for the members of the committee on how to run the event?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer

548,1656,63,5,So you didn't -- it was -- your exposure to the award was when you became a member?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
549,1658,63,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
550,1659,63,8,"Okay.  Was it -- when you were part of the committee -- when you were a member on the committee, was there any discussion about inviting the Lombardis to the event?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

552,1664,63,13,Do you think they should have been invited to the event?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
553,1666,63,15,I can't say that they weren't.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
554,1667,63,16,Okay.  But let's say -- let's say -- let's say they weren't.  I'm not saying that that's your testimony.  Do you think they -- do you think they should be there?,q,MR. TODD,start_chat
555,1671,63,20,Objection.  That's a different question.,side_chat,MR. GARVIN,start_chat

557,1674,63,23,"(BY MR. TODD)  Regardless of whether or not they were invited, do you think the Lombardis have a place at this event?  Do you think they have a role to play in this event?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
558,1679,64,2,My impression was that there was a standing invitation for anybody in the Lombardi family to attend the event.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
559,1682,64,5,Do you know if the Club made any attempt to coordinate their attendance?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
560,1684,64,7,I believe those attempts were made and that -- that people reached out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
561,1686,64,9,Why do you believe that?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
562,1687,64,10,"Because it was talked about, like, ""Who's coming from the Lombardi family this year?  Who's going to attend?""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
563,1690,64,13,"So do you remember any more about that, like what kinds of invitations were extended or who -- who might be attending from the family?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer
564,1693,64,16,"I don't.  I mean, my -- my -- looking back on it, my -- my view of that was that people with a much longer history than mine involved in the award were also involved in those matters. Certainly there was -- I never heard a single word of exclusionary intent towards anybody in the Lombardi family.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
565,1700,64,23,"Do you think -- in your opinion if the Lombardis had wanted something changed about the award, do you think Rotary would have responded to that?",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

567,1707,65,4,Sure.  Do you feel like the Lombardis have a say in how this should -- this event should be carried out?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
568,1710,65,7,"I think that in proper context Rotary would embrace their input, but the name is separate from the award in my opinion.  The Rotary Lombardi Award is something that the Rotary Club built and did its best to advance every year, and the relationship with the Lombardi family was always a big element of that.  So, you know, if you're -- if there's a relationship, you respect what goes back and forth in that relationship.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

575,1730,66,1,Does Rotary have an obligation to uphold the dignity of that image?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
576,1732,66,3,"I'm struggling with your question, to be candid with you.  I'm trying to -- I'm trying to think about what I know about Rotary and how Rotary operates, the good that we do in the world, somehow being held up against an interpretation of duty or obligation.  I'm not sure that -- that's just tough for me. Rotary does a lot of good things in the world.  And I don't feel like I have to sit here and defend Rotary, but -- but, you know, any -- any kind of an assertion that Rotary is not doing right by something is difficult for me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
577,1744,66,15,"The implication here is that the Rotary Club of Houston has some kind of permanent right to use the Lombardi name.

TODD,start_answer

I come from a big family, and I'm just here to tell you that everybody tends to speak for themselves.

613,1839,70,6,No.  This -- what I'm aware of in the context of what we're talking about proximate to this letter is that the discussions were that -- that -- that nobody really had the authority to speak for the entire family unless they could demonstrate they had that authority and that there was a lot of discussion that other people in the overall family may not and probably did not agree with this.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
614,1848,70,15,"What does ""a lot of discussion"" mean?  Does that mean formal agenda items at meetings, or does that mean --",q,MR. TODD,start_answer

680,1988,75,25,I never heard anybody in Rotary say the award was personally theirs.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
681,1991,76,2,"Okay.  But we're talking about the vision for the award in terms of what it's going to accomplish, what it should represent, how it should be viewed in the community, was it being used to raise money for cancer research.

684,2002,76,13,"It's a difficult question to answer.  I think that Rotary's -- Rotary's intention has always been with the Rotary Lombardi Award to advance the award, make it a prestigious event, use it for fundraising, innovate, improve, and increase it along the way, as they've done for all of these years.  And my view of what Rick Slemaker personally wanted to do with the award was to own it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

697,2032,77,17,Equal status as the Heisman Award.  Was that Rotary Club of Houston's goal?,q,MR. TODD,start_answer
698,2034,77,19,"We're talking cats and dogs differences here.  The -- the -- advancing an award, increasing its prestige, having it be year over year beneficial to cancer research and so on is -- you don't know what you don't know.  I don't know what I don't know.  But I'm just telling you from me the difference of having this award be being at its base somebody's personal property and having ideas for the award and so on be driven by ego at a singular personal level after it being a product and something that evolved with the Rotary Club of Houston for 47 years, it's hard for me to talk about those two things as though they're on the same set of railroad tracks.  That's really what this is about.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

It's just extremely confusing to have two Rotary Clubs presenting two Lombardi Awards in the same community, especially in the context of the fact that a newly formed club was involved in and claimed it was now going to take the Lombardi award forward and so on.  There's a lot of -- just a lot of confusion in the air within the world of Rotary, as limited to Houston anyway.

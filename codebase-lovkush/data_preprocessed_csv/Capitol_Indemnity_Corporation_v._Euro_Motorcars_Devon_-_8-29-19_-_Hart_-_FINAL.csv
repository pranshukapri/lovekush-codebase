I'm going to ask you a series of questions today.  Any time you don't understand my question, please let me know, I'll be happy to restate it for you.

8,180,6,7,Yep.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
9,181,6,8,"If at any time today you want a break or anything like that, please let me know.

41,258,9,10,All right.  And what was in the file other than the file notes that you looked at?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
42,260,9,12,"Various reports from our independent adjuster, a lot of invoices and -- I'm trying to think what else -- photographs, engineer reports.  I don't know, there's a lot in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
43,265,9,17,Okay.  And when was the first time that you had anything to do with this loss at the Clemens facility?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
44,268,9,20,"It was assigned to me originally, so basically when we got the loss report, which I think was the day after the fire, it was in my name, and it was in my name the whole time, I think, so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
45,274,10,1,And who was the insured that Millers had on that property?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
46,276,10,3,"I believe it was P.R. Clemens Family, LP.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
47,278,10,5,"And is it your understanding that your insured owned the physical plant there, the building?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
48,281,10,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
49,282,10,9,"Okay.  And what was the insurance, basically what was the insurance coverage that Millers provided to P.R. Family Partnership?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
50,285,10,12,"It was for building coverage and with that business income, which was rental income from I think Clemens Uniform or Clemens Cleaning, something like that.  So the businesses that ran in the building.  But our coverage applied to the building.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
51,291,10,18,"Okay.  And after this loss was received or you got notice of it, did you personally go there to the scene?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
52,294,10,21,"Yes.  I think it was within -- I think it was the day after we received the report of the claim, so within 48 hours of the loss.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,299,11,1,And what was the purpose of going there?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
54,301,11,3,"Just overall site inspection and kind of, I don't know, scope it out, I guess, and meeting with, I believe the fire marshal was still onsite, emergency services contractors were there, our independent adjuster, Dave Bennett, was there.  And I think there may have been a few other people, I can't remember.  But basically just to kind of get eyes on it, see the extent of the damage and what the building looked like.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,311,11,13,"You mentioned that there was an independent adjuster, David Bennett, who was there.  When was Mr. Bennett retained?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
56,314,11,16,"Would have been the same day we received the loss.  Just knowing the size, I think there was news coverage of it, we just kind of knew with the limit and the video and what the news was reporting, it was a large loss.  And he's usually who we use for losses of that size.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
57,321,11,23,Okay.  And what was he retained to do?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
58,324,12,1,To adjust the claim and basically quantify the damages.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,326,12,3,"And when you say adjust the claim and quantify the damages, can you be more specific in terms of what was his real assignment, what was he supposed to do?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
60,330,12,7,"Sure.  Basically to write a repair estimate or determine the value of the building, if it's a full replacement or, you know, answer questions regarding the policy or apply the appropriate coverages to, you know, items they may run into that may not fall under the typical building coverage but might be added on as extensions or enhancements or things like that.  So basically to apply the coverage as it appears on the policy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,340,12,17,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_chat

70,358,13,10,Yes.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
71,359,13,11,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
72,360,13,12,"And if you could, could you take a moment and review, just in your head, the question 85 and the answer that's there.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
73,363,13,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
74,364,13,16,Have you had an opportunity to review that?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
75,366,13,18,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
76,367,13,19,And is that an accurate answer in terms of the total amount that was paid by Millers Capital Insurance to or on behalf of the Clemens Family Partnership?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
77,371,13,23,"I believe it is, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
78,372,13,24,"Okay.  So there really, as you said, there are two things that were paid.  First there was $2,401,763.52 paid for building damage; correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
79,377,14,4,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
80,378,14,5,"And then there was $187,560.52 for business income?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
81,380,14,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
82,381,14,8,"And we'll get into it more, but that business income is actually a loss of rental income; correct?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
83,384,14,11,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
84,385,14,12,"So let's talk about the building damage, that $2.4 million.  What does that number represent?  Is it a number for the repair of the building or is that a number for what the building was worth before the fire?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
85,390,14,17,"That was basically our policy limit was $2.3 million.  Then there was, I think there's an automatic 4% increase every year, so I think Dave Bennett calculated it as our limit would have been like $2.365, or something like that, so that would be for the repair or replacement of the damage up to that amount. And then there was various enhancements or extensions of things that are added on.  I know debris removal is one of them.  I think some landscaping we can cover, fire department charges.  Certain things are added on to increase the limit other than what's stated on the property schedule.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
86,406,15,8,Okay.  And is it your understanding that that $2.4 million that was paid was like the max limit that was available?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
87,409,15,11,"Yes, I believe it was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
88,410,15,12,Okay.  And was there a determination made by you or anyone acting on behalf of Millers of what the value of the building was the day before the fire?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
89,414,15,16,"Yeah, I believe Dave Bennett would have done that with, I think he used a program, Marshall Swift, that you can type in the square footage of a building, the occupancy, the construction, everything.  I mean, you can lay in as many details as you know and it should give you an accurate amount of what it would cost to tear it down and rebuild it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
90,424,16,1,"Okay.  That's not my question. Okay?  That's a question of, like, like you said, tearing it down and rebuilding it.  But did anyone make a determination of what was the value of that building the day before the fire?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
91,430,16,7,"Yeah, I believe I did answer that Dave Bennett would have done that as part of the initial investigation that he was doing, is determine that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
92,434,16,11,"And did you ever, did Mr. Bennett ever verbally or in writing convey to you what that number was?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
93,437,16,14,I don't remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
94,438,16,15,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

102,453,17,5,"Yes, I have.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,454,17,6,And who was C.N. Timbie Engineers retained by?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
104,456,17,8,He was retained by Millers to do structural evaluation of the building.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,458,17,10,"Okay.  And why was that done, why did Millers hire him to do that?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
106,460,17,12,"I believe the borough or the fire marshal wanted to tear the building down.  And we, I know we knew many people would want to be in there and looking around and, you know, determining their own cause and origin investigation.  And also to determine if the building needed to be torn down, as they said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,467,17,19,All right.  And what was your understanding of what Mr. Timbie's recommendations were in terms of whether or not the building needed to be torn down?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
108,471,17,23,"I believe he said part of it could remain, which would have been, I don't remember the direction, but basically the far end of the building away from where the fire started, I think he said it could remain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
109,477,18,4,"And who made the decision, if you know or if you have been told, who made the decision that the building would be torn down in its entirety?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
110,481,18,8,"I believe the insured made that decision, but I don't know for sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,483,18,10,"And when the insured made that decision, did that impact in any way the value of what Millers was willing to pay in terms of like the rebuilding or restoring the property?",q,MR. BLUM,start_chat

117,501,19,3,"Okay, you can go ahead and answer.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer

So we wouldn't have been making that determination or letting it affect our, how much we were going to be paying.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

125,522,19,24,And have you ever seen this before?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
126,524,20,1,"Well, I was copied on it, so I assume I did see it at some point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
127,526,20,3,And is it accurate that by July 20th of 2016 you had at least a preliminary estimate from Mr. Bennett on the cost of rebuilding the structures?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
128,530,20,7,"That appears accurate, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
129,531,20,8,"Okay.  And when you received the estimate which is attached, did you review it?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
130,533,20,10,"Yeah, I would have reviewed the attachments, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
131,535,20,12,"Okay.  If we could look at Page 1 of the estimate itself, it's numbered in the bottom right corner.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
132,538,20,15,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,539,20,16,"When you received this, if you look on the actual estimate portion, there are five columns there, the first of which is Description.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
134,543,20,20,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,544,20,21,Then there's a Unit Cost.  Did you have an understanding of what that unit cost was?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
136,547,20,24,I'm going to -- what do you mean by did I understand the unit cost?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,550,21,2,"What did you understand that to mean, what did you understand that to represent?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
138,553,21,5,"Well, that would be the cost for a contractor to do that work.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,555,21,7,"Okay.  And then as you go across, there's three columns there, RCV, DEP, and ACV.  Can you tell me what your understanding of those were?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
140,559,21,11,"So the replacement cost value, and the RCV would have been the total amount based on square footage.  And the unit cost depreciation is DEP, and that's the, basically due to the age and condition of the descriptive item, you know, basically how it is, loses value or its life expectancy at the time.  And then you subtract that off of the RCV number to arrive at the ACV number, which is the actual cash value.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
141,569,21,21,"And if we go all the way to the end, there is a summary at the very back page. Which of these numbers, if any, that appear there are what Millers agreed to pay?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
142,574,22,1,"Well, at this point it would have been the ACV number, $1,998,047.70.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
143,576,22,3,"Okay.  And as we sit here today, then, can you tell us what the difference is between the 1.998 and the 2.4 million that was paid?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
144,580,22,7,Are you asking the dollar amount?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,581,22,8,"No.  I'm asking what it was for, and I apologize that was not clear. So, in other words, if you paid 1.998 for the ACV on the building, what else did you pay that went from the 1.998 up to the 2.4 million?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
146,587,22,14,"I guess I'm still not understanding your question.  I mean, the ACV is issued as, you know, up front.  And then they have to provide the invoices and receipts and proof of payments for -- to show that they incurred the $2.483 million loss for us to pay additional dollars.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,594,22,21,"Okay, I think I understand.  So what you're saying is that if in fact the insured spent more than the 1.998 rebuilding it, you would have paid them up to the policy limit for the replacement?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
148,600,23,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,601,23,3,"Okay.  So if we went back to the answer to Interrogatory No. 85, the 2.4 million there is an amount that was paid because the insured rebuilt the building and provided the invoices?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
150,606,23,8,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,607,23,9,Okay.  And was it Mr. Bennett or you or someone else who put together the information to verify that all those funds were spent on the building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
152,611,23,13,"Yes, Mr. Bennett met with Randy from Clemens I think a few times and gathered invoices, receipts, canceled checks, and all kinds of documentation and put it together to prove that the money was incurred and spent and the building was repaired and was back in a useful state.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,618,23,20,"Okay.  You can put that aside. To the best of your knowledge, did you ever see another estimate from Mr. Bennett?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
154,622,23,24,"I don't recall.  He may have had -- he may have shared another one before sending that one.  I don't know.  I mean, sometimes there are preliminary estimates and they are revised.  I don't know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,628,24,5,"That one was the preliminary one, that's the earliest one that I saw.  But did you ever see a later one that was dated beyond July 20th of 2016?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
156,632,24,9,I don't remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,633,24,10,"I'm going to switch for a moment, if we could, to the income loss.  Okay?  Who was responsible for verifying or determining what amount would be paid for the income loss?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
158,637,24,14,That was also Dave Bennett's responsibility.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,639,24,16,And did Mr. Bennett ever provide you with any kind of a written report or any information off of which you could base the amount of the income loss that was paid?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
160,643,24,20,"Yes.  I believe he -- he had sent me things over the course of the claim's life.  I don't remember exactly what they were, but he gathered either leases or income statements or something from Randy to show what was being paid to, I guess, Clemens Family, LP, as or in consideration of rent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,651,25,3,And is it the policy or did this policy of insurance cover the total amount of the rent that was lost or was it the loss of actual income that they would have had from the rental property?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
162,656,25,8,"Well, the language of the policy has been the income for rental properties, it's typically that is the rent, there's not usually, you know, profit and loss statement or something where there's a balancing of actual profit and expenses and things like that, so it's usually just rent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,663,25,15,"So it is the position of Millers that, you know, if the rent is 10,000 a month, you reimburse the actual 10,000, not what the income would have been for the landlord?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
164,667,25,19,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,668,25,20,And do you know what period of time was covered under the policy for that rental loss?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
166,671,25,23,"Yeah.  The policy states it's 12 months.  Typically the policy has a 72-hour waiting period before it begins, though we have an enhancement on our policy that it deletes that 72-hour waiting period.  And I believe it adds up to maybe 60 days for additional loss of income, I don't remember the exact language at this time.  But we did make a consideration for those additional 60 days and paid an additional figure, I can't remember the exact amount, past 12 months to kind of help things conclude in claims.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,684,26,11,"Is it accurate -- I don't want to put words in your mouth -- what Millers would have done, what Millers did do is essentially pay 14 months of rental income?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
168,688,26,15,I don't think that's completely accurate.  I believe we paid a portion for the 13th and 14th month.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,691,26,18,Okay.,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
170,692,26,19,"I can't remember the exact dollar amounts or anything, but I believe the building was mostly back to the way it was prior to the claim within 12 months or at the end of that period, and we didn't pay the full monthly rent for those additional two months, from what I recall.  So if he had -- if the rent was 10,000 a month, there was I think three or four different spaces in there, so if three of them were back to normal and one was still being worked on, we wouldn't pay the full 10,000, we would pay only the portion that was still uninhabitable or unoccupied or still under construction.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,707,27,9,And who made that decision about like the percentage that would be paid once there was a portion of the building?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
172,710,27,12,"Dave Bennett calculated that with Randy to iron that out, because I think the -- I can't remember the specifics, but he worked that out and had it laid out so Randy would understand it as well what we were paying for.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,715,27,17,And did you receive any kind of a report from him or something in writing which told you what the amount you should pay is?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
174,718,27,20,"Yeah, I think there either would have been a report or just an email saying, this is what we agreed was going to be paid.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,721,27,23,Okay.  And was the Clemens Family Partnership also reimbursed for lost rent from a company called S-Bond Technologies?,q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
176,725,28,2,I have never heard the name so I'm not sure.  Is that one of the tenants of the building?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,728,28,5,"It was a tenant, yes.",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
178,729,28,6,"Okay.  Then, yeah, that would have been factored in to the rent calculation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,731,28,8,"And, again, Mr. Bennett would be the person who put those figures together or calculated them?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
180,734,28,11,Yes.  I believe he gathered the leases or whatever agreements or income statements to show what was being paid.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,737,28,14,"Okay.  And what, if any, participation did you have in the investigation of the cause and origin of the fire that occurred at this location?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
182,741,28,18,"We retained Schriver, I think it's, Fire and Explosion Investigations, so Brad Schriver, he was out there with I believe maybe one or two other cause and origin investigators to, you know, examine the scene and try to pinpoint exactly where the fire started and why.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,749,29,1,"And other than retaining that outside expert, did you personally have any involvement in that investigation?",q,MR. BLUM,start_answer
184,752,29,4,"I was not there when they were doing the investigation, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

I don't think they were there when I was on the scene, and that was really my main, you know, involvement of, you know, any discussions or anything, was really that day.  I don't know that Dave Bennett would have, but I don't know for sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

    "1) Sometimes in a question, we have the questioner being identified:\\\n",
    "`Q.  (BY MR. SMITH) <question>`\\\n",
    "The `(BY MR. SMITH)` should be removed as it is not part of the question. Currently it is not being removed\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Certain types of headers are not being detected and are considered part of a question/answer. For example:\\\n",
    "`I have no further questions. F U R T H E R E X A M I N A T I O N`\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The page numbering does not always work correctly. One reason why is from the file `Transcript_for_sync_HG082219.txt`:\\\n",
    "`00010:01 Q. Okay. Did you look at the LLC agreement?`\\\n",
    "In most depositions, the page number has its own line at the top, whereas in this deposition, the page number and first line of text is part of top line of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) There are certain kinds of duplicates that are not detected. I have not spent any time to work out why. E.g.:\\\n",

    "5) Identifying questioner does not always work. E.g. in `082319.txt`:\\\n",

    "10    EXAMINATION BY\n",
    "11    MR. CROKE:\n",
    "12        Q.    Good morning, Mr. Mathur.```\\\n",
    "Currently I look for the phrase `BY MR. CROKE` on one line, whereas here it is split on two lines\n",

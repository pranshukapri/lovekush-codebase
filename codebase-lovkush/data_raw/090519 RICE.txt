          15   BY MS. SEREDA:

          16   Q.     Good morning, Ms. Rice.  My name is

          17   Devon Sereda.  I am one of the attorneys

          18   representing the defendants in this matter.

          19          Have you ever had your deposition

          20   taken before?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     I'm going to give you a few

          23   instructions to make today go smoothly, okay?

          24   We have a court reporter sitting between us.

                                                            6



           1   She is taking down everything that you and I

           2   say.  For that reason, it's important that

           3   all your responses be verbal.

           4          It's easy in everyday conversation to

           5   nod, shrug your shoulders, say uh-uh or

           6   uh-huh, but that won't make a clear record.

           7   If you do that I'm going to give you a quick

           8   reminder that we need a verbal response,

           9   okay?

          10   A.     Okay.

          11   Q.     It's easy in everyday conversation to

          12   anticipate where my question is going and

          13   start to answer before my question is done,

          14   but that makes her job harder.  Try to let me

          15   finish my question before you start your

          16   answer.  If for any reason I cut off your

          17   answer and started my next question, let me

          18   know, so I can make sure we get your full

          19   answer on the record.

          20   A.     Okay.

          21   Q.     I'm sure your attorney has advised you

          22   of this, but we want to make sure you don't

          23   guess at any answers today.  If I ask you a

          24   question and you don't know the answer or you

                                                            7



           1   don't remember the answer, those are

           2   perfectly acceptable responses, as long as

           3   that's the truth, okay?

           4   A.     Okay.

           5   Q.     There may be questions that I ask you

           6   to estimate time or distance.  Once again, I

           7   don't want you to guess, but if you feel like

           8   you're able to make an estimate, go ahead and

           9   do so.  Just let me know you're making an

          10   estimate, okay?

          11          I'm pretty quick at taking

          12   depositions, but if at any time you need to

          13   take a break, use the restroom, speak with

          14   your attorney, whatever it may be, I'm happy

          15   to give you that time.  I just ask, if there

          16   is a question pending, that you answer that

          17   question before we take our break, okay?

          18   A.     Okay.

          19   Q.     If I ask a question and you don't

          20   understand it, be sure to let me know,

          21   because if you answer the question, I'm going

          22   to assume you understood it.  If any part of

          23   my question seems unclear, just let me know.

          24   I'll be happy to rephrase it so it is clear,

           2   A.     Okay.

           3   Q.     Do you have any questions about those

           4   instructions?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Are you under the influence of

           7   anything; drugs, alcohol, medication, lack of

           8   sleep, anything that would prevent you from

           9   being able to understand and answer my

          10   questions truthfully and accurately here

          11   today?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Are you ready to begin?

          14   A.     I'm ready.

          15   Q.     Can you give us your full name?

          16   A.     Jaquaya Rice, J-A-Q-U-A-Y-A, R-I-C-E.

          17   Q.     What's your date of birth?

           3   Park.  The main street is Hunting Park.

           4          The light is facing towards me at the

          23   Q.     If the incident hadn't occurred, you

          24   would have crossed to that other corner and

                                                           21



           1   then crossed the street?

           2   A.     No, I would have -- this is the

           3   corner.  I would have crossed the street.

           4   The bus stop is right here, the 89 stop.

           5   Q.     You're actually crossing the street

           6   when the incident occurred?

           7   A.     Correct.

           8   Q.     Can you tell me how the accident

           9   occurred?

          10   A.     On the corner of I Street, you have

          11   the cars that can go both ways.  Cars can go

          12   straight down I Street, going towards I and

          13   Eerie.  Then you have cars that can go down

          14   the opposite direction, going towards I and

          15   Bristol.  Cars can go this way, and cars can

          16   go that way.

          17          Cars that's in the middle of, I guess

          18   you can say, I Street coming from Eerie can

          19   turn onto Hunting Park going towards G and

          20   Hunting Park.  My light had the pedestrian

          21   walk sign.  So the number signs never came up

          22   at the time I was crossing the street when he

          23   turned that white van going onto Hunting Park

          24   going towards G and Hunting Park.  At the

                                                           22



           1   time I got hit, it was literally in the

           2   middle of the street.

           3   Q.     You said you were walking your

           4   daughter?

           5   A.     My daughter was walking with me.

           6   Q.     Was your daughter walking next to you,

           7   behind you, in front of you?

           8   A.     She was walking next to me but a

           9   couple feet behind me a little bit.

          10   Q.     When you say next to you, was that

          11   closer to the van or farther from the van?

          12   A.     It was farther from the van because it

          13   hit me first and then she jumped back.

          14   Q.     Prior to the impact, did you see the

          15   white van?

          16   A.     I seen it in the process about to

          17   turn.  But common sense, if I'm in the middle

          18   of the street, why would you turn?

          19   Q.     Did you see it stop at all prior to

          20   the impact?

          21   A.     He stopped as soon as he went boom.

          22   Q.     After the impact, he stopped?

          23   A.     Right.

          24   Q.     But prior to that, did you see him

                                                           23



           1   making the left-hand turn, or did you see him

           2   stop before to check for traffic or anything

           3   of that nature?

           4   A.     No, he was the first car.  He was just

           5   in the process of turning onto Hunting Park

           6   going towards G Street.

           7   Q.     What was your daughter's name that was

           8   walking with you?

           9   A.     Rayana R-A-Y-A-N-A, Purefoey,

          10   P-U-R-E-F-O-E-Y.

          11   Q.     You said she was 13 at the time?

          12   A.     She was like 12.

          13   Q.     You said that it happened in the

          14   middle of the intersection.

          15          Was it completely in the middle of

          16   Hunting Park where you're crossing?

          17   A.     There are two double-yellow lines for

          18   cars to come down Hunting Park going towards

          19   G and Hunting Park.  On the other side, you

          20   have where the 89 is going down towards M and

          21   Hunting Park to make a turn onto Castor

          22   Avenue, that bus route.

          23          The cars are going both ways in the

          24   intersection.  The barrier is the two

           1   double-yellow lines for cars to go both ways

           2   down Hunting Park.

           3   Q.     Did it happen directly in the middle

           4   of the two lanes there?

           5   A.     There are two lanes in between the

           6   double lines.  Two cars can go down Hunting

           7   Park going towards G Street, and on the

           8   opposite side there is two cars that can go

           9   towards Castor Avenue from Hunting Park.

          10          When the car turned from I Street on

          11   the opposite direction, he has to make a

          12   wider turn onto Hunting Park to get towards G

          13   and Hunting Park.  You have to look between

          14   ongoing traffic because you have cars going

          15   down I Street going towards I and Eerie.

          16          Then the cars coming from the opposite

          17   way on I Street can go towards I and Bristol

          18   going towards I and Cayuga where those cars

          19   can make a right or left turn.

          20          It's a park right in front of the

          21   street.  You have to be mindful of the

          22   oncoming traffic because cars are going this

          23   way and this way.

          24   Q.     He's making a left-hand turn, correct?

                                                           25



           1   A.     The car is coming down I Street.

           2   Q.     You're doing a lot of gesturing.

           3   A.     The car is coming down I Street, and

           4   then it's making a --

           5               MR. MCCANDLESS:  It's a left.

           6               THE WITNESS:  It's a left turn

           7   onto Hunting Park.

           8   BY MS. SEREDA:

           9   Q.     What I'm trying to get at is -- and

          10   you're doing a good job.  I understand it's a

          11   complicated intersection -- but what I want

          12   to find out is where the actual impact

          13   occurred on Hunting Park?

          14   A.     I'm on the corner, walking across the

          15   street.

          16               MR. MCCANDLESS:  Did you get to

          17   the double-yellow lines before you got hit?

          18               THE WITNESS:  No, I did not get

          19   to the double yellow.

          20   BY MS. SEREDA:

          21   Q.     That's what I was trying to find out.

          22   A.     I'm in the middle of the street where

          23   the white lines are, the barrier for the

          24   white lines, before you get to the double

                                                           26



           1   yellow --

           2   Q.     That divides Hunting Park?

           3   A.     Right, where the two cars can come

           4   down Hunting Park going towards G street, I'm

           5   in the middle of them white lanes where the

           6   two cars can come down Hunting Park.

           7          Mr. Torres' car is in the middle of

           8   the street.  The cars had to go around him.

           9   When he got out of the car, he dragged me

          10   from the white lines back to the side where I

          11   came from on the corner of I and Hunting

          12   Park.

          13   Q.     When you say he dragged you, explain

          14   to me how that happened.

          15   A.     As he's turning real quick, I turn

          16   around.  I'm like, what the fuck, and I fall

          17   on my knees.  I break my fall with my hands.

          18   I tilted over.  He rushes out the car, drags

          19   me from the street back to the corner where I

          20   initially came from.  I'm on the ground, and

          21   he says, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

          22   Q.     When you say he dragged you, it wasn't

          23   with the car; it was with his person?

          24   A.     Right, took me by the cuff of my

                                                           27



           1   underarms and dragged me to the sidewalk.

           2   Q.     Did you actually have any contact with

           3   the van?

           4   A.     Yes, the bumper of the van hit me on

           5   my knees, both of my knees.  Because when I

           6   turned around and actually seen the car, I

           7   couldn't do nothing.

           8   Q.     You said it hit both your knees.

           9          Were you basically facing the front of

          10   the van when the impact occurred?

          11   A.     When the car turned and I'm walking

          12   across the street, I'm just like, what the

          13   fuck?  It happened so fast.  To explain it

          14   more in depth, I really can't because it was

          15   just like I turned around and it's like boom.

          16   Q.     You said you broke the fall with your

          17   hands and fell onto your knees?

          18   A.     This parts of my hand.

          19   Q.     You're indicating the palms of your

          20   hand?

          21               MR. MCCANDLESS:  I think we call

          22   that the heel.

          23               MS. SEREDA:  Heel of your hand.

           1   BY MS. SEREDA:

           2   Q.     You said he got out of the van,

           3   grabbed you under the underarms and dragged

           4   you back to the corner from where you had

           5   come from?

           6   A.     Correct.

           7   Q.     And said he was sorry?

           8   A.     Correct.

           9   Q.     What happened from there?

          10   A.     The other two guys that were in the

          11   car with him -- there was a person in the

          12   passenger seat -- they got out of the car.

          13   My daughter was like, you hit my mom.  He

          14   said I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

          15   Q.     Who is he?

          16   A.     Mr. Torres said that he was sorry.

          17   I'm like, you really hurt my knees really

          18   bad.  How couldn't you see me?  The other

          19   person that was in the car in the passenger

          20   side was just shaking his head the whole time

          21   and was translating for Mr. Torres.

          22          At the time, Mr. Torres got on the

          23   phone with, I guess, his boss, Jeffrey or

          24   whatever his name is.  I can't recall.  We

           1   tried to wait for the police, but they didn't

           2   come at all.

           3          I asked for his name.  He told me

           4   Hector Torres.  He told me whom he worked

           5   for.  He didn't give me other information,

           6   but it was a language barrier, so there was

           7   not too much that we both could do.

           8   Q.     You said there were two other guys in

           9   the vehicle?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     But only one --

          12   A.     Was translating.  It was a skinny guy.

          13   Q.     What did the other person look like?

          14               MR. MCCANDLESS:  Which other?

          15               MS. SEREDA:  The skinny guy,

          16   other than being skinny.

          17               THE WITNESS:  The guy that was in

          18   the passenger side was about my height with

          19   spiky hair, had on boots, Hispanic.

          20   BY MS. SEREDA:

          21   Q.     How about the third passenger?

          22   A.     The third passenger was the same size

          23   as Mr. Torres, little huskier.  I really

          24   don't remember hair or anything, but he could

           1   not speak any English at all.

           2               MS. GARBER:  I have two questions

           3   for her before you move on to a different

           4   topic.  I think it will be more confusing if

           5   we go back; is that okay?

           6               MS. SEREDA:  That's fine.  Go

           7   ahead.

          12   Q.     Ms. Rice, my name is Cheryl Garber.

          13   I'm with Garber Law.  I'm personal counsel

          14   for Pro-Coat Painters.

          15          Good morning.

          16   A.     Good morning.

          17   Q.     While on the topic, I have a couple

          18   questions for you.

          19          When you said Mr. Torres said I'm

          20   sorry, I'm sorry, was he speaking in English

          21   or Spanish?

          22   A.     He said, I sorry, I sorry, I sorry,

          23   just like that.

          24   Q.     When you say that he grabbed you under

           1   your arms and dragged you to the corner, can

           2   you describe that for me a little bit more.

           3          Can you tell me were your feet on the

           4   ground?  Were your knees on the ground?

           5          What was the lower portion of your

           6   body doing when he assisted you to the

           7   corner?

           8   A.     When I fell on my knees, I tilted over

           9   a little bit, and Mr. Torres got out of the

          10   car.  He rushed because he was in a panic,

          11   you could tell; eyes bulging open.  I was in

          12   a panic because I was scared.

          13          He grabbed me under the cuff of my

          14   underarms and dragged me on the sidewalk of

          15   which I first initially came from when I was

          16   trying to walk across the street.

          17   Q.     Is it fair to say your feet were sort

          18   of on the ground being drug along?

          19          You weren't being drug on your knees;

          20   it wasn't ruining your clothes, right?

          21   A.     I got drug from my back.  The back of

          22   the heels of my shoes, my clogs, were

          23   dragging.  My jacket was a three-quarter

          24   length.  It came to my knees basically.  The

                                                           32



           1   bottom part of my jacket was dragging on the

           2   ground.

           3   Q.     You mentioned your clogs.  Can you

           4   tell me a little more.

           5          What did they look like?  Did they

           6   have a wedge heel?  Did they have a heel

           7   heel?

           8   A.     They're pink clogs, like nursing clogs

           9   for support for my feet.

          10   Q.     What does the heel look like?

          11   A.     They're just a brown clog heel.

          12   Q.     Is there a separation in between the

          13   heel and the middle of the shoe on the bottom

          14   or is it all one piece?

          15   A.     No, it's all one piece.

          16               MS. GARBER:  Thank you, ma'am.

          22          Was the roadway wet?

          23   A.     Yes, it was wet.

           1          Was there any snow on the ground or

           2   ice?

           3   A.     It was slushy.  The night before was

           4   that temperature where it was icy.  That

           5   morning when it was raining, the rain broke

           6   some of the ice, so it made it slushy.

           8   sidewalk.

           9          Are you standing at this point,

          10   sitting?

          11   A.     I'm sitting down on the ground.

          12   Q.     How are you sitting?  Are you sitting

          13   Indian style?  Are you sitting off the curb?

          14   How are you sitting?

          15   A.     With my back towards the pole, and I'm

          20   were in the other vehicle and your daughter;

          21   anybody that came up to you and said, hey, I

          22   saw this happen?

          23   A.     Nobody came up.  They just was

          24   looking.  Everybody gave their two cents, but

           1   it was early in the morning.  Everybody was

           2   trying to get to work.  People trying to get

           3   their kids to school.

           4   Q.     Did the vehicle actually push you to

           5   the ground, or did you fall from the

           6   surprise?

           7   A.     No, it pushed me to the ground because

           8   he was trying to stop.

           9   Q.     How do you know he was trying to stop?

          10   A.     Because you heard the skrrt, that

          11   part.

          12   Q.     You heard the screech of brakes?

          13   A.     Right.

          14   Q.     You said you said what the fuck and

          15   were surprised.

          16          How much time passed between when you

          17   saw something was about to happen and the

          18   impact actually occurring?  Was it

          19   instantaneous, or was there a few seconds

          20   that went by?

          21   A.     I didn't even have a few seconds

          22   because when I'm walking across the street

          23   and he's turning and it starts to count 23,

          24   22 seconds and before I even reach that

           1   double-yellow line, before I knew it, the car

           2   just said boom.  I turned around, and it's

           3   right when I'm on my knees.  I'm like, what

           4   the fuck?

           5   Q.     Prior to you starting to cross the

           6   street when you were still on the corner, did

           7   you see his vehicle at that point?

           8   A.     I really wasn't paying attention

           9   because the little pedestrian walk thing was

          10   up, and the light was green.  My recollection

          11   is I can walk across the street.  I'm not

          12   going to cross the street on a red or yellow

          13   light.

          14   Q.     How would you describe the force of

          15   the impact from the vehicle?

          16   A.     It was hard to the point where my

          17   daughter was crying, so it was hard enough.

          18   Q.     Just to be clear, your daughter was

          19   not hit by the vehicle, correct?

          20   A.     Correct.

          21   Q.     You said that the police did not come

          22   to the scene.

          23          Did you call the police?

          24   A.     Yes.

           1   Q.     Did you have a cell phone on you at

           2   the time?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     Were you carrying anything at the time

           5   when the incident occurred?

           6   A.     Just a pocketbook.

           7   Q.     What kind of pocketbook was it?

           8   A.     Just a shoulder bag.

           9   Q.     Did anybody else come to the scene?

          10   A.     My sister came.

          11   Q.     What's your sister's name?

          12   A.     Jasma, J-A-S-M-A.  Same last name,

          13   Rice.

          14   Q.     How soon after the accident did she

          15   come to the scene?

          16   A.     Right after, like five, ten minutes.

          17   She had to walk from my mom's house to I

          18   Street.

          19   Q.     Is that the only person that you knew

          20   that came to the scene of the accident?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Did any ambulance personnel come to

          23   the scene?

          24   A.     Yes.  Hold on.  They came, but they

                                                           37



           1   came about 15, 20 minutes later.  Clothes was

           2   drenched wet.

           3   Q.     Your clothes?

           4   A.     Yes, pants and jacket was wet.

           5   Q.     What did you tell the EMS personnel

           6   when they came?

           7   A.     My daughter was hysterical.  I've

           8   never been hit by a car before.  She's like,

           9   Mom, Mom, can we get to the hospital a

          10   different way.  I was like I'm not going to

          11   get in the ambulance right now.  They were

          12   like, are you sure?  You look a little

          13   disoriented.  I was like I'm okay, I'm okay.

          14          They started talking to Mr. Torres,

          15   but there was a language barrier.  The skinny

          16   guy was trying to translate.  After that, I

          17   went back to my mom's house, changed my

          18   clothes because I was wet and didn't want to

          19   go to the hospital wet, and I went to the ER.

          20   Q.     You said your pants and your jacket

          21   were wet?

          22   A.     My pants were wet.  My jacket was wet.

          23   Q.     You said it was wet.

          24          Was it wet in the back, in the front,

                                                           38



           1   the entire jacket?

           2   A.     The back of my jacket was wet, but

           3   after laying on the ground, my whole jacket

           4   was wet.  It had black spots on it and

           5   everything.  It was a cream-colored jacket.

           6   Q.     Was your daughter still crying and

           7   upset when the EMS personnel got there?

           8   A.     I just told her to relax before they

           9   even got there.  I'm like, relax, call Titi,

          10   which is my sister.  I'm okay, I'm okay.  I'm

          11   fine.  She didn't go to school that day.

          12   Q.     Was she still crying when the

          13   ambulance personnel came?

          14   A.     No, she was just breathing heavy,

          15   shocked.

          16   Q.     Did you have any other conversation

          17   with anybody else at the scene?

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     Any more attempts at conversation with

          20   Mr. Torres?

          21   A.     No, he was just like, I'm sorry, I'm

          22   sorry, I'm sorry.  The other guy was

          23   translating.  I was like you really hurt my

          24   knees.  How did you not see me?  He kept

                                                           39



           1   saying, I sorry, I sorry.

           2          Then when I was like how did you hit

           3   me, he kept saying no se, no se, no se.  Then

           4   the skinny guy was translating to him what I

           5   said.  Then Mr. Torres spoke back to him in

           6   Spanish, and I just asked what is you saying.

           7          Mr. Torres called, I guess, his

           8   supervisor at Pro-Coat, and the skinny guy

           9   gave me the information of Pro-Coat, the name

          10   of the company, his name and the boss' name

          11   and that's it.

          12   Q.     How long would you say you were

          13   actually at the scene for?

          14   A.     I was there for a long time.  Police

          15   never came.  I wound up going to the

          16   24th/25th District to make a report.  The

          17   information that Mr. Torres gave me that day,

          18   I filed a report with that information.

          19   Q.     When did you go to the district?

          20   A.     That same day.

          21   Q.     After the emergency room?

          22   A.     No, no, before I went to the emergency

          23   room.

          24   Q.     Did you go home first, change your

                                                           40



           1   clothes, and then go to the police office?

           2   A.     No, I went to the police station

           3   first, made the report.  They gave me the

           4   report number.  I went home, just threw on

           5   some sweatpants and went to the emergency

           6   room.

           7   Q.     Which ER did you go to?

           8   A.     Elkins Park.

           9   Q.     Did you tell the EMS personnel what

          10   was bothering you?

          11   A.     I told them my knees hurt, and I said

          12   I'm just in pain.  But at that time that day,

          13   when I tried to break my fall with the cuff

          14   of my hands, those were hurting me.  I had a

          15   little bruise because I'm light, so I had a

          16   bruise there.

          17   Q.     Did you tell the EMS personnel about

          18   your hands or just your knees?

          19   A.     Well, they could see it because I was

          20   showing them.  They were like, are you okay?

          21   Are you sure you're okay?  The short EMS lady

          22   thought I was a little disoriented and was

          23   like, are you sure you're okay?  I said I'm

          24   okay.  I just want to make sure my daughter

                                                           41



           1   is okay.

           2   Q.     Did you see any damage to the van from

           3   the impact?

           4   A.     To tell you the truth, I didn't look.

           5   Q.     You went to Elkins Park for the ER.

           6          Is that Aria?

           7   A.     Einstein.

           8   Q.     What did you tell them your complaints

           9   were when you went to Einstein?

          10   A.     When you initially go through

          11   admissions, they asked me what's the reason I

          12   was here.  I said I was hit by a vehicle,

          13   gave the information that Mr. Torres gave me.

          14   After that, they said what's going on.  I

          15   showed them my hands and my knees.  I got an

          16   x-ray.

          17          At the time, they asked for my

          18   insurance information.  I waited, and they

          19   were like you have some swelling in your

          20   knees but it's nothing we can do.  Try to put

          21   an ice pack on it.  They put an ice pack on

          22   my hands.  They were like, by tomorrow, you

          23   may feel soreness and things like that.

          24   Q.     You said swelling.

                                                           42



           1          Was the swelling in both knees?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     What did they take x-rays of?

           4   A.     They took x-rays of my knees and my

           5   back.

           6   Q.     Why your back?

           7   A.     Because I told them it was hurting.

           8   Q.     You didn't mention that before, so

           9   that's why I'm asking that.

          10          You told them your hands were hurting,

          11   your back, and knees?

          12   A.     Right.

          13   Q.     Was it your upper back, middle back,

          14   lower back, whole back?

          15   A.     Lower back.

          16   Q.     When did that start hurting you?

          17   A.     It was just a sharp pain.  I was just

          18   like, what the hell?

          19   Q.     Was that immediately after the

          20   accident, or did it develop?

          21   A.     No, it happened maybe an hour or two

          22   after.  It was just like a soreness, I guess,

          23   from just the dragging and just the shock or

          24   whatever.

                                                           43



           1   Q.     Did they discuss the results of the

           2   x-rays with you?

           3   A.     They said they couldn't find anything.

           4   My knees showed swelling or whatnot but that

           5   was about it.

           6   Q.     I think you said you had bruising on

           7   your hands?

           8   A.     Yeah, I had bruising on my hands,

           9   right here at the bottom.

          10   Q.     Indicating the heel of your hand?

          11   A.     Correct.

          12   Q.     Did you take any photographs of the

          13   bruising?

          14   A.     No, I wasn't thinking about that --

          15   hold on.  I did on my daughter's phone, but

          16   she switched phones.  I couldn't find those

          17   pictures.  My daughter had took a picture of

          18   the license plate of the van.  When she

          19   accompanied me at the ER before I went in the

          20   x-ray, she did take a picture of the palms of

          21   my hands.

          22   Q.     You no longer have those?

          23   A.     I just can't find them because through

          24   Google photographs and this is a new phone

                                                           44



           1   that she received, so we just couldn't locate

           2   the pictures.

           3   Q.     How long were you at the hospital for?

           4   A.     Hours.  From 10:30 -- hold on.  I got

           5   to think.  Probably approximately 9:30, and I

           6   didn't get discharged until about 2:00 or

           7   3:00.

           8   Q.     You said they told you to put ice on

           9   both your hands and knees?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Did they give you any other discharge

          12   instructions?

          13   A.     They just said follow up with my

          14   primary physician, follow up with physical

          15   therapy, if needed.

          16   Q.     When is the next time you sought

          17   medical treatment?

          18   A.     Approximately, the end of January, the

          19   beginning of February.

          20   Q.     Where did you go?

          21   A.     Philly Spine Center on North Broad

          22   Street.  Then I went to Philly Spine Center

          23   on Cottman Avenue.

          24   Q.     Why the gap in treatment?

                                                           45



           1   A.     Because I don't have no more time left

           2   at work.  I have two children.  I have to be

           3   a mom, as well.  You have to deal with the

           4   pain and just go on with life.

           5   Q.     When you first went to Philly Spine

           6   Center, were your complaints the same; your

           7   hands, low back, and knees?

           8   A.     When I went to North Broad Street, my

           9   knees were very agitated and hurting.

          10   Basically, I was always an active person.  I

          11   did ballet for 18 years.  I never had any

          12   type of knee pain, back pain, or anything

          13   like that.

          14   Q.     It was just your knees?

          15   A.     It was knee pain, back pain.  I just

          16   did at-home exercises.

          17   Q.     Prior to going there?

          18   A.     Prior; take baths with Epsom salt,

          19   doctor Teal's Epsom Salt.

          20   Q.     How did you come about treating with

          21   Philly Spine?  How did you find the facility?

          22   A.     I spoke to an attorney in regard to

          23   the accident.  After that, I was referred to

          24   Philly Spine Center.

                                                           46



           1   Q.     What did they do for you there at

           2   Philly Spine?  What kind of treatment?

           3   A.     Just physical therapy treatment, like

           4   back treatment, knee treatment.

           5   Q.     What specifically?

           7   hands on, a vibrating massage thing, walking

           8   exercises, exercises with my knees.  They

           9   gave me a paper of what I can do at home to

          10   try to take down the pressure of knee pain

          11   and things like that.  I told them what I was

          12   doing at home before I even got to them.

          13   Q.     How often were you going for

          14   treatment?

          15   A.     Two to three times a week.

          16   Q.     How long would each visit last?

          17   A.     Probably like a half-hour.

          18   Q.     How many months did you treat with

          19   Philly Spine?

          20   A.     February 2018 to -- I don't remember.

          21   I think in 2019.  The one on Cottman Avenue

          22   released me, I think, in March or April 2019.

          23   I don't really remember off hand, but

          24   approximately around that time.

           1   Q.     Your recollection is you were treating

           2   up until this past spring?

           3   A.     Yeah.

           4   Q.     Was there any break in that treatment

           5   at Philly Spine?

           6   A.     Of course, I would miss some days

           7   because I have children, so most likely I

           8   have to miss days.

           9   Q.     Any large gaps between the end of

          10   January beginning of February 2018?

          11   A.     It wasn't too big of a gap, but, yes,

          12   I would miss some days out of the week.

          13   Sometimes I would go one day out of the week,

          14   sometimes I would go two.  I have to do

          15   homework.  I have to cook.  I have to work.

          16   I have to pay bills.  I have to be a mom.

          17   Q.     Did they send you out for any

          18   diagnostic testing?

          19   A.     I went to MRI Diagnostics.

          20   Q.     You had an MRI done?

          21   A.     Yeah.

          22               MR. MCCANDLESS:  You had an EMG.

          23               Didn't somebody come to Cottman

          24   Avenue and do an EMG?

                                                           48



           1               THE WITNESS:  I had an EMG, but I

           2   had an MRI done on Roosevelt Boulevard, that

           3   diagnostic place where I sit in the chair and

           4   they did an MRI.

           5   BY MS. SEREDA:

           6   Q.     Of what body parts?

           7   A.     They did it of my lumbar spine,

           8   cervical.

           9   Q.     Why your cervical?

          10   A.     That's just what the doctor ordered.

          11   Q.     Did you have any neck complaints?

          12   A.     Sometimes I had neck complaints, but

          13   that's what he ordered.  When I went, I was

          14   like, Doc, I felt like it was a shooting

          15   nerve pain, and I never had this before.  To

          16   be honest, I didn't have it the day of the

          17   accident, but maybe a week or two later I

          18   started having this sharp pain in my neck

          19   shooting up and down my neck.

          20   Q.     Your lumbar spine, your cervical

          21   spine.

          22          Any other body parts they did an MRI

          23   of?

          24   A.     If they did, I don't know.

          14   going to discuss that with me.

          15   Q.     Did he ever?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     What did he tell you?

          18   A.     Oh, I don't remember.  I don't

          19   remember.

          20   Q.     How about the MRI, did anyone discuss

          21   the results of the MRI with you?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     What did they tell you?

           2   Q.     Anything else they told you about the

           3   MRIs?

           4   A.     They said it was swelling around the

           5   tissue in my back.  It showed an aggravated

           6   nerve.

           7   Q.     When you stopped going to Philly

           8   Spine, were you discharged, or did you

           9   voluntarily stop going?

          10   A.     No, the doctor discharged me.

          11   Q.     Did you see any other doctors after

          12   you were discharged from Philly Spine?

          13   A.     I went to MRCP.

          14   Q.     When did you go to MRCP?

          15   A.     When did I go to MRCP?

          16   Q.     You can't ask him.  I just want to

          17   know what your memory is.

          18   A.     I don't remember.

          19   Q.     But it was after Philly Spine?

          20   A.     It was after Philly Spine.

          21   Q.     Was it fairly recently?

          22   A.     No, it wasn't recently.  It was a

          23   couple months ago.

          24   Q.     How long did you go to MRCP for?

                                                           51



           1   A.     I went to the one downtown.  I went to

           2   the one up the boulevard.  I went to MRCP

           3   downtown maybe about two or three times.

           4   Then I was referred to the one on Roosevelt

           5   Boulevard.  I went there about twice.  Then

           6   after that I didn't have time to go back.

           7   Q.     Who referred you there?

           8   A.     MRCP downtown, Dr. Yang.

           9   Q.     Who is Dr. Yang?

          10   A.     She's the doctor at MRCP.

          11   Q.     Who referred you to MRCP?

          12   A.     My attorney.

          13   Q.     What kind of treatment were you

          14   getting at MRCP?

          15   A.     Just therapy treatment, exercises to

          16   exercise my knee and my back, because they

          17   asked me what was my complaints.  I told them

          18   that off and on periodically my knees pain

          19   me, and I never had those issues before.

          20   Q.     Did the physical therapy that you

          21   received at Philly Spine improve your pain at

          22   all?

          23   A.     After a couple months, it improved a

          24   little because I wasn't having consistent

                                                           52



           1   pain in my knees.  It's seven days out of the

           2   week.  My knees were paining me more so four

           3   to five days out of the week where I was

           4   taking Epsom salt baths to help me and Motrin

           5   to help me.

           6   Q.     When you were discharged from

           7   treatment at Philly Spine, were you still

           8   having back and knee pain?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Neck pain?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Had it improved from when you first

          13   went to Philly Spine?

          14   A.     A little.

          15   Q.     How about the treatment you received

          16   at MRCP, did that help with your pain at all?

          17   A.     A little.  Like I told them, it just

          18   happens periodically.

          19   Q.     When is the last time that you can

          20   remember going to MRCP?

          21   A.     I think I went in June or July.

          22   Q.     Just recently?

          23   A.     June or July.

          24   Q.     Do you have plans to go back to treat

                                                           53



           1   with them?

           2   A.     Hold on.  May Or June.

           3   Q.     Are you planning on seeking further

           4   treatment with them?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Do you have any current appointments

           7   scheduled?

           8   A.     Not yet because I don't have any more

           9   time right now at work.

          10   Q.     Other than the physical therapy, did

          11   you have any other type of treatment at MRCP?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     When were you typically going to these

          14   visits for physical therapy at Philly Spine

          15   and MRCP?  Was it during your workday, after

          16   work?

          17   A.     No, I was getting transportation, so

          18   it was after work.

          19   Q.     Both facilities?

          20   A.     MRCP, I believe, I went one time when

          21   I was off of work.  Yeah, about two or three

          22   times I went when I was off of work when I

          23   had other appointments.  Then it was another

          24   time, I think, on the weekend or maybe after

                                                           54



           1   work hours, I believe.

           2   Q.     Philly Spine was providing you

           3   transportation.  MRCP you were getting there

           4   on your own?

           5   A.     I was getting there on my own.

           6   Q.     Did MRCP send you out for any

           7   diagnostic testing; x-ray, MRI, anything of

           8   that?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     What did they send you for?

          11   A.     They sent me for an MRI of my knees.

          12   Q.     Did they discuss the results of the

          13   MRI?

          14   A.     I never went.

          15   Q.     Why did you not go?

          16   A.     Because during the time of the

          17   accident, my job had sent me a form in

          18   reference to when I had went to go get some

          19   diagnostic tests done.  I had gave the MRI

          20   center my health insurance.

          21          I received something back from my job

          22   that said, as a result, we cannot pay for

          23   this billing because you were in a car

          24   accident at the time.  You need to forward

                                                           55



           1   this information to your attorney's office,

           2   and you need to discuss with the attorney's

           3   office ways to pay this because it wasn't

           4   being paid for under my insurance.

           5   Q.     You got a denial letter for your prior

           6   MRIs from your health insurance?

           7   A.     One denial letter.  That was at the

           8   time I was being represented by Simon &

           9   Simon.

          10   Q.     You didn't go to get another MRI

          11   because they had denied payment?

          12   A.     I didn't want the same issue to happen

          13   again.

          14   Q.     Any other treatment that we're missing

          15   that you've had in relation to the accident.

          16          We have the ER, Philly Spine, the EMG

          17   with a male doctor, the MRIs, MRCP.  Anywhere

          18   else that we're missing?

          19   A.     But the EMG was done at Philly Spine

          20   Center.

          21   Q.     But you said a male doctor came in and

          22   did that?

          23   A.     Correct.

          24   Q.     Any other health providers or

                                                           56



           1   treatment providers I'm missing?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     Ever see your primary care doctor in

           4   relation to this?

           5   A.     I seen him once in reference to this.

           6   He told me to treat my pain with Motrin and

           7   to go see a physical therapist or a

           8   chiropractor.

           9   Q.     When was this that you saw your

          10   primary care?

          11   A.     I seen him about a week or two after

          12   the accident.

          13   Q.     Let's talk about how you're currently

          14   feeling.  I don't mean as you're sitting in

          15   the chair today, but let's just talk about in

          16   the last 30 days.

          17          Are you still getting low back pain?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     How often?

          20   A.     It's seven days out of a week, so

          21   maybe three or four days out of the week.  If

          22   it's seven days, it happens about four days

          23   out of the week.

          24   Q.     Four days out of the week.

                                                           57



           1          How long does it last when you

           2   typically get it?

           3   A.     Sometimes it lasts for an hour or two.

           4   Sometimes it lasts for minutes.  If I take

           5   medication, meaning ibuprofen or Advil, it

           6   lasts for no more than a half-hour.

           7   Q.     What would you say your pain is like

           8   in your low back when you get it on a 0 to 10

           9   scale, 0 being no pain, 10 being the worst

          10   pain you can imagine?

          11   A.     It's about an 8 or 9.

          12   Q.     How about neck pain, are you still

          13   getting that shooting pain in your neck?

          14   A.     I get it periodically.

          15   Q.     How often?

          16   A.     Probably about three, four days out of

          17   the week.

          18   Q.     What's the pain level in your neck

          19   when you get it?

          20   A.     About an 8 or 9.

           1   week.

           2   Q.     Is the pain level the same in both

           3   your knees or is one worse?

           4   A.     Both of them is the same.

           5   Q.     What's the pain level like in your

           6   knees?

           7   A.     Between 1 and 10?

           8   Q.     Yes.

           9   A.     Like a 10.

          10   Q.     How about your hands, are you still

          11   getting hand pain?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     How long did that take to resolve

          14   after the accident?

          15   A.     Probably about seven, eight months

          16   after with the exercise.

          17   Q.     How long did the bruising last after

          18   the accident?

          19   A.     I'm pretty light, so it lasted for

          20   about a week or two.

          21   Q.     Did anyone ever prescribe you any

          22   medication in relation to the accident?

          23   A.     No, I just took ibuprofen.

          24   Q.     Did anyone give you any sort of

                                                           59



           1   medical equipment to use at home?

           2   A.     I received a paper of medical

           3   equipment that I can buy.

           4   Q.     But nobody gave you anything, like a

           5   pillow or brace or anything like that?

           6   A.     No.  They gave me a list of things

           7   that I can buy that I bought myself.

           8   Q.     What did you buy?

           9   A.     I bought some knee brace.  When it's

          10   cold or rainy, that's when the pain really

          11   aggravates me more.  I went to Rite Aid or

          12   Walmart and bought knee braces, things like

          13   that.  Ice packs to bring down the pain, make

          14   it easier.

          15   Q.     Do you still get any swelling in your

          16   knees?

          17   A.     I get swelling in my left knee.

          18   Q.     How often does that happen?

          19   A.     When it rains, if I walk too long.

          20   Q.     Let's talk about how these injuries

          21   have affected your life.  I'm going to break

          22   that down into two different categories.

          23          First, I want to know about any

          24   activities that you were doing before this

                                                           60



           1   accident that you have not returned to at all

           2   since this accident.

           3          Then I'm going to ask you about

           4   activities that you still do, but you do them

           5   with some sort of pain or limitation,

           6   different from how you did them prior to the

           7   accident, okay?

           8          When I say activities, it's a very

           9   broad term.  I want you to tell me anything

          10   you do on a daily basis; grooming, chores,

          11   hobbies, social activities, relationship with

          12   your family, work, anything on a daily basis,

          13   okay?

          14   A.     Okay.

          15   Q.     First, are there any activities that

          16   you completely stopped doing?

          17               THE WITNESS:  Can we take a

          18   break?

          21    this time.)

          23   BY MS. SEREDA:

          24   Q.     I was starting to ask you about your

                                                           61



           1   limitations.  I think my last question was,

           2   are there any activities you were doing

           3   before the accident that you haven't returned

           4   to at all since the accident?

           5   A.     Well, I have two children.  I have a

           6   13 and a 10-year-old.  Things I used to do

           7   with them before I don't do as much with them

           8   now.  I do it, but I don't do it as often as

           9   I used to.

          10   Q.     Are there any activities that you

          11   can't do at all?

          12   A.     No, there's no activities I can't do

          13   at all.

          14   Q.     Let's talk about activities you do

          15   less frequently or you do them in a different

          16   way because of your injuries?

          17   A.     I don't clean my house as frequently

          18   as I used to.  I catch SEPTA transportation,

          19   so waiting by the bus stop and things like

          20   that.  I'd rather just stay in the house or

          21   sit outside than to walk to the bus stop and

          22   walk to my mom's house and go to the mall.

          23          Me and my kids used to go out to eat

          24   and things like that, but I don't do it as

                                                           62



           1   often as I want to.  It's limited.  I still

           2   do it, but it's just limited.

           3   Q.     How about any specific chores at home

           4   or grooming, anything like that?

           5   A.     Cleaning the bathroom.  I usually go

           6   to the hairdresser every two weeks.  It's

           7   about every three weeks now.  To sit in the

           8   chair and sit underneath the dryer in that

           9   cramped space, I can't do that every two

          10   weeks.  I go when I feel up to it or

          11   basically when I can.

          12   Q.     How about work, anything different

          13   with work?

          14   A.     At work, they accommodate me a lot.  I

          15   have a chair with a pillow that sits behind

          16   me.  I can stand and sit frequently or at my

          17   leisure.  I have a step stool that my legs

          18   can rest on.  I can go to the nurse and get

          19   ice packs when I need them.  My job is really

          20   accommodating me.

          21   Q.     Anything else that you can think of

          22   that's been changed or altered or done less

          23   frequently as a result of your injuries?

          24   A.     Just going out and interacting with my

                                                           63



           1   family.  I don't go as often as I would

           2   before.  That's life.  I mean, I go, but it's

           3   not all the time.

           4   Q.     You mean social events with your

           5   family?

           6   A.     Yeah, like social events.  I can't

           7   wear heels that long.  I got to take them off

           8   and come down.  I used to wear heels for

           9   hours at a time.  Now, with these knees, I

          10   only can keep them on for about 15, 20

          11   minutes.  After that, I got to come down to

          12   some flats or some sneakers.

          13   Q.     Anything else you can think of?

          14   A.     No, that's it.

          15   Q.     If you think of anything else as we're

          16   going along, just let me know.

          17   A.     That's it.  Trust me.

          18   Q.     Any other outstanding medical bills

          19   that you may have, which we'll work out with

          20   your counsel?

          21          Are there any moneys you can think of

          22   that you have paid out of pocket for in

          23   relation to the accident that you haven't

          24   been reimbursed for?

                                                           64



           1   A.     Only stuff that I buy -- not buy --

           2   have bought for my knees to help when I have

           3   to go to work or maybe I'm at an event by the

           4   pool, a knee brace and things like that.

           5   Q.     The knee braces that you bought?

           6   A.     Yeah, that's it, and the heating pad.

           7   That's about it.

           8   Q.     Prior to this incident, had you ever

           9   been in a motor vehicle accident before?

           5   you been in any motor vehicle accidents?

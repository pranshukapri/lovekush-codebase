       15  BY MS. LUNCEFORD:

       16      Q.   Will you state your full name for the record,

       17  please.

       18      A.   Richard Anthony Boullion.

       19      Q.   Mr. Boullion, my name is Erin Lunceford.  And

       20  we just met, correct?

       21      A.   Yes, ma'am.

       22      Q.   I represent the defendant, Kuraray, in this

       23  case, and we're going to take your deposition today.

       24      A.   Yes, ma'am.

       25      Q.   If -- I tend to kind of go fast through this

        1  stuff.  So if I ask you something that you don't

        2  understand, if I can get your agreement just to ask me

        3  to repeat or rephrase my question.  Is that okay?

        4      A.   Yes, ma'am.

        5      Q.   And you're doing a great job so far.  Try not

        6  to talk on top of each other.  I'll try not to start

        7  another question before you finish.  That way the court

        8  reporter doesn't get mad at us.  Is that okay?

        9      A.   Yes, ma'am.

       10      Q.   And one final thing:  If you would answer

       11  "yes" or "no," or whatever the answer is as, opposed to

       12  "uh-huh" and "uh-uh," because that doesn't come across

       13  very well on the record.

       14      A.   I'm straightforward.

       15      Q.   Okay.  And I always warn people that if you do

       16  say "uh-huh" by mistake, I just say, "Is that a yes?"

       17  And I warn you that I'm not trying to pick on you.  I'm

       18  just trying to get a clear record.

       19      A.   That's fine.

       20      Q.   Okay.  What -- have you ever been deposed

       21  before?

       22      A.   Do what?

       23      Q.   Have you ever had a deposition before?

        3  hooch is?  Like just general.

        4      A.   Because you got to go all the way down here.

        5  And I would turn.  So I'm assuming it's -- because I

        6  would have to walk around from here.  So it's somewhere

        9      Q.   Okay.

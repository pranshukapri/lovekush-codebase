 3                       EXAMINATION
 4   BY MR. WRAY:
 5        Q    State your full name for the record,
 6   please.
 7        A    Shellie Lynne West Hodges.
 8        Q    And I understand you prefer to go by
 9   Ms. West.  Is that correct?
10        A    Yeah.  That's my maiden name, and that's
11   how people know me here, I grew up here, so Shellie
12   West is good for me.
13        Q    Ms. West, my name is Ron Wray, and I
14   introduced myself just prior to the deposition
15   today.  I am one of the attorneys representing the
16   defendants in a lawsuit that you've brought, and
17   I'm here today to ask you some questions about
18   that.
19             For purposes of today, do you understand
20   that in this lawsuit you've named a number of
21   different Walmart entities as defendants in this
22   case?
23        A    I guess that's correct.
24        Q    Well, there are a number of different
25   defendants in the case.  I just wanted you to
0006
 1   understand that for purposes of today, when I refer
 2   to Walmart, I'm talking about all the defendants
 3   named in the case.  Do you understand that?
 4        A    Yes, yes.  Okay.
 5        Q    Have you ever given a deposition before?
 6        A    Yes, I have.
 7        Q    In what context was that?
 8        A    This is my third deposition.  The first
 9   was as a defamation of character lawsuit with a
10   councilwoman on Hilton Head.  I was brought in by
11   the defendant just as an expert on how tax money is
12   handled with the Convention and Visitor Bureau and
13   Chamber of Commerce because I run the Chamber.  And
14   the second one was for probate.
15        Q    In the defamation claim that you were
16   involved in, were you actually a party to that case
17   or just a witness?
18        A    No, just a -- just an expert witness on
19   use of funds.
20        Q    And you were asked to come in and testify
21   as an expert on behalf of the defendant in that
22   case you said?
23        A    I'm not sure.  I guess it was on his
24   behalf.
25        Q    Do you recall who the parties were?
0007
 1        A    It's Skip Hoagland.  I don't remember the
 2   attorney.
 3        Q    Skip Hegland was --
 4        A    Hoagland, H-O-A-G-L-A-N-D.
 5        Q    Was that the party that you were retained
 6   to testify for?
 7        A    That's who I was deposed by, yes.
 8        Q    That was the lawyer who took your
 9   deposition?
10        A    No, that is the defendant against the
11   defamation suit.
12        Q    And who was the person bringing the
13   lawsuit?  Do you recall?
14        A    Kim Lankins, counsel on Hilton Head.
15        Q    Who was it that retained you in that case
16   to testify?
17        A    What do you mean retained me?
18        Q    You said you were hired as an expert
19   witness.  Who was it that actually --
20        A    Oh, no, I wasn't hired, no.  He just -- I
21   was just brought in to say how chambers are run and
22   how those monies and funds are distributed through
23   chambers of commerce.
24        Q    And then the probate case, is that the
25   matter involving --
0008
 1        A    The estate.
 2        Q    -- Gayla?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    And are you the plaintiff in that case?
 5        A    I am the personal representative.
 6        Q    When were you deposed in that case?
 7        A    Couple weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago,
 8   maybe four.
 9        Q    Who is representing you as the personal
10   representative?
11        A    Antonia Lucia.  She's the probate
12   attorney.
13        Q    And do you recall the lawyer who actually
14   took your deposition?
15        A    Brian Treacy.
16        Q    So you've been deposed twice before, and
17   today will make your third opportunity to give a
18   deposition?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    So you're familiar with the procedure?
21        A    Uh-huh.
22        Q    Is that yes?
23        A    Yes.  I'm sorry.
24        Q    Well, I was going to tell you --
25        A    I know the head shake doesn't count.
0009
 1   Yes, yes.  Sorry.
 2        Q    Right.  A couple ground rules is we will
 3   need verbal responses.
 4        A    Right.
 5        Q    And then also we're talking a little bit
 6   over each other this morning.  If you'll wait until
 7   I'm finished with my question, I'll try to wait
 8   until you're finished with your answer, and that
 9   way we can get an accurate transcript, okay.
10        A    Okay.
11        Q    I'm sure -- I'm confident that today I'll
12   ask you something that's confusing or doesn't make
13   any sense.  If that should happen, would you please
14   just ask me to repeat my question to make sure you
15   understand it?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Is there any reason that you can't give
18   honest and truthful testimony this morning?
19        A    No, there is not.
20        Q    Are you under the influence of any drugs,
21   alcohol, or medication that would impact your
22   ability to understand my questions and give
23   truthful testimony?
24        A    No.
25        Q    Where do you currently live, Ms. West?

 6        Q    Were you the sole owner of the Bluffton
 7   Business Club?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    And what else have you done in terms of
10   your career since you got your master's?
11        A    I was a department head manager for Hyatt
12   Hotels on Hilton Head.
13        Q    What years did you do that?
14        A    My mind just went blank.  It was before I
15   got married.  It would have been -- I think I
16   started there in '96 and left in '99, and then I
17   worked for the Resort Services, Inc. as a -- well,
18   I started with employment management, and then I
19   moved over to sales, and then I left there in two
20   thousand -- 2001, after I had my first child.
21        Q    We met your sister Leigh yesterday.  Is
22   she your only sibling?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Any stepsisters?
25        A    No.
0017
 1        Q    Or stepbrothers?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    Do you have any other relatives that live
 4   in what I'm going to call the Lowcountry of South
 5   Carolina other than your sister?
 6        A    My ex-husband's brother lives here, Gary
 7   Hodges, but not blood related, no.
 8        Q    Where does the rest of your family live?
 9   You mentioned you were born in Augusta.  Is most of
10   your family still in Georgia?
11        A    Yes.  Most of them are scattered through
12   Georgia.
13             Let me step back.  My mother does live in
14   Ridgeland.  I forgot she's here.  I don't see her
15   very often.  But my mother and her husband live in
16   Knowles Island in Ridgeland.
17        Q    What's your mom's name?
18        A    Linda Phillips.
19        Q    And what's her husband's name?
20        A    Greg Phillips.
21        Q    And you did good a moment ago.  If you
22   think of something that you've said earlier that
23   may not have been accurate or you remember some
24   additional information, feel free to let me know.
25        A    Okay.
0018
 1        Q    So you recall your mom obviously lives
 2   over in Ridgeland.  Anybody other than your mom
 3   that you know, relatives that live in South
 4   Carolina?
 5        A    I don't think so.  There could be a few
 6   out there.  We just don't know who they are.  But
 7   no, not -- none that I know of.
 8        Q    Ms. West, we're going to spend a lot of
 9   time today talking about your dad and of course
10   about the incident that this lawsuit involves.  Let
11   me say initially that I apologize, and I'm sorry
12   that this brings us here under these circumstances.
13   I know it's going to be tough at times, so we'll go
14   at your pace.  If you need to take a break, if you
15   want to stop at any time, if you'll let me know,
16   okay.
17        A    Okay.
18        Q    Let me just ask you first, I know your
19   dad's name was Randolph West, correct?
20        A    William Randolph West, Jr.
21        Q    Okay.  William Randolph West, Jr. and --
22        A    He went by Randy.
23        Q    And that's what I wanted to ask you.  For
24   purposes of our discussion today, would you prefer
25   that I refer to him as Randy, Mr. West, or how
0019
 1   would you like for me to talk about him?
 2        A    "Your dad."
 3        Q    Let me ask you some questions about your
 4   dad.  You mentioned that you live -- I'm sorry.  Do
 5   you need a break already?
 6        A    I'm sorry.  I haven't talked about it
 7   much.
 8        Q    That's okay.  As I said, we can break any
 9   time you want to.  Do you want to stop for a
10   moment?
11        A    Just give me a second.  Okay.
12        Q    It really is fine.  Any time you want to
13   stop, you just let me know, okay.
14        A    It's just hard because I haven't really
15   talked -- you know, you talk about it a lot in the
16   beginning, and it's been almost a year now, and you
17   try not to burden your family and your friends with
18   it after a point, so just -- anyway, sorry.
19        Q    I understand.  So I was asking you about
20   your dad.  You told me you were born in Augusta.
21   Is that where your dad was from?
22        A    He was a military brat, and he was born
23   in -- I don't know if it was actually Brunswick,
24   Georgia, or if he was actually born on St. Simons
25   Island.  But my granddaddy was a Marine, so he was
0020
 1   a military brat.  But they ended up in Augusta
 2   after my granddaddy retired, and he went to high
 3   school there and college, part of college, some
 4   college.
 5        Q    What was the furthest your dad went in
 6   school?
 7        A    Probably two years.
 8        Q    Do you know where he attended?
 9        A    AC, Augusta College.
10        Q    And did I understand from your answer
11   earlier he didn't actually graduate or get a degree
12   from there?
13        A    No.
14        Q    He was a high school graduate?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Where did he graduate high school?
17        A    Butler High.
18        Q    Did he join the military himself?
19        A    No.
20        Q    What did your dad do after he finished
21   high school?
22        A    I'm not sure what he was doing because my
23   parents had me at a young age.  My mother was 19,
24   and he was 20.  So I know he was going to college.
25   He was probably working at night, but I don't know
0021
 1   where.  I don't recall where.
 2        Q    Did your dad attend any trade schools or
 3   technical schools to develop any professional
 4   skills?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    I understand he was a contractor?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Was he a licensed general contractor?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    And he was licensed in the state of South
11   Carolina?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    Do you know if he was licensed in any
14   other states?
15        A    No, just South Carolina.
16        Q    You mentioned that your --
17        A    Wait a minute.  I've got to step back.
18        Q    Okay.
19        A    I know he did some remodeling work when
20   we were in Augusta, so I would imagine he would
21   have had a license there.
22        Q    You mentioned that your dad and mom had
23   you at a fairly early age.  When were your parents
24   married?  Do you know the date?
25        A    I know it was October 13th, and it was a
0022
 1   Friday, because we used to joke about that, that
 2   they were married on Friday the 13th.  I was born
 3   in '68, so I think they were married '67.
 4        Q    Was that -- and your dad was married to
 5   Linda?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Was that his first marriage?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Was that Linda's first marriage, to your
10   knowledge?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    And then I know your dad was married to
13   Gayla at the time of this incident.  Is that
14   correct?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Did he have any other marriages besides
17   Linda and Gayla?
18        A    No.
19        Q    When did your parents divorce?
20        A    I'm not sure of the year.  I was 25, and
21   I was in grad school, so it could have been '92 or
22   '93.  I'd have to do the math.  If you want me to
23   do the math, I can.
24        Q    No, that's fine.  '92 or '93 is fine.
25             And then other than you and Leigh, did
0023
 1   your father have any other children?
 2        A    I don't think so.  No, not to my
 3   knowledge.
 4        Q    I understand your dad ran a contracting
 5   business here in Bluffton?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    What was the name of his business?
 8        A    Randolph West Builders.
 9        Q    Was he the sole proprietor of that
10   business?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Anybody else have any ownership interest
13   in that business, to your knowledge?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Do you know when that business was
16   started?
17        A    I'd have to guess '82 or '83.
18        Q    What was the nature of the business?  I
19   know it's contracting, but what kind of work did
20   your dad do?
21        A    He really specialized in upfitting and
22   remodel work, commercial upfitting and remodel and
23   regime work, a lot of repairs.
24        Q    Were there any employees of the business?
25        A    No.
0024
 1        Q    So your dad did it all?  He was the owner
 2   and did all the work himself?
 3        A    Well, he subcontracted out, yeah.
 4        Q    Is Randolph West Builders still in
 5   operation?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Now, did you have any relationship or
 8   business association with Randolph West Builders?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    What was your relationship with the
11   business?
12        A    I was the office manager and did the
13   bookkeeping.
14        Q    How long did you do that work for your
15   dad?
16        A    I think ten years.
17        Q    When did you begin doing that?
18        A    2002.
19        Q    And then did you quit around 2012?
20        A    No, not -- well, I started my business
21   2010, but I was still helping him.  Once we -- once
22   we formed the chamber, then I got busier with the
23   chamber and then started backing away from doing a
24   lot of stuff for him.
25        Q    So you said you started around 2002, and
0025
 1   you initially told me you thought you did that for
 2   around ten years, so did you leave working with
 3   your dad or for your dad around 2012 when you
 4   started working at the chamber?
 5        A    Yeah, that's probably accurate.
 6        Q    Did anybody take over the role that you
 7   had been doing with your dad?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    So after you kind of left that position,
10   did he then just do those tasks on his own?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    What other businesses, if any, did your
13   dad own?
14        A    He owned Seacoast Enterprises with a
15   gentleman named Joe Buckles that was a boat
16   building company.
17        Q    What was his partner's name?
18        A    Joe Buckles.
19        Q    When was that business started?
20        A    I'm not sure.
21        Q    Is it still operating?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    Mr. Buckles still runs that?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    And was that located here in Bluffton?
0026
 1        A    It was originally located in Hardeeville,
 2   South Carolina.
 3        Q    What other businesses, if any, did your
 4   dad own?
 5        A    Trident, LLC.
 6        Q    What was Trident, LLC?
 7        A    It's just a property development, holds
 8   property and a building.
 9        Q    Do you know when that was formed?
10        A    2008.
11        Q    Does it still operate?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    And are there any other owners of that
14   business?
15        A    Yes.  The managing partner is Miles
16   Loadholt.
17        Q    Is Trident, LLC based here in Bluffton?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    Any other businesses?
20        A    Commercial Services, Inc., which isn't
21   operating.
22        Q    What was Commercial Services, Inc.?
23        A    It was a janitorial services company that
24   my dad and my ex-husband and I started in 2005.  I
25   could be off on the date.  I'm not sure without
0027
 1   looking at the document, but I believe it was
 2   around that time.
 3        Q    When do you believe that ceased
 4   operations?
 5        A    I think we had it operating for maybe two
 6   years.
 7        Q    So 2005 to 2007, roughly?
 8        A    Yeah.
 9        Q    Any other businesses?
10        A    No.
11        Q    What other properties, if any, did your
12   dad own?  He had a house here at 8 Myrtle Island
13   Road?
14        A    It doesn't matter what order I give it to
15   you?  I just got to think.  I got to go around the
16   town.  He owned 8 Myrtle Island Road, which was his
17   primary residence, for -- since -- I think he built
18   it in '83, and that's where my sister and I grew
19   up.  He had just recently bought a property across
20   the street, eight -- I mean, 11 Myrtle Island, and
21   it was a fixer-upper.
22             Are you talking personal property or
23   property within the businesses too?
24        Q    Property that he owned personally.
25        A    The other personal property is in Santa
0028
 1   Claus, Georgia.  It's three lots.
 2        Q    Any other property that you know he owned
 3   at the time of his death?
 4        A    Not personal property, no.
 5        Q    Gayla told us yesterday that your father
 6   had some interest in an antique store somewhere in
 7   Georgia.  Do you know anything about that?
 8        A    Yes.  That's under Seacoast Enterprises.
 9        Q    What was the name of that business or
10   place?
11        A    The Little Red Wagon.
12        Q    Do you have familiarity with the earnings
13   from your dad's various businesses?
14        A    Somewhat, yes.
15        Q    You mentioned you had done
16   paperwork/bookkeeping for a while for your dad at
17   least at Randolph West Builders.  What were the
18   earnings for that business, if you know, in the
19   year 2018?
20        A    We haven't done the taxes yet, so I
21   couldn't articulate that.  He ran on cash flow, so
22   the cash that came in pretty much went out as it
23   came in.  I couldn't tell you what he netted.  I
24   don't think it was substantial.  And he had sold a
25   boat, so he had some money in there from selling
0029
 1   the boat.  But my guess is somewhere between around
 2   $30,000 net is what I'm guessing.
 3        Q    What would you think the gross would have
 4   been for 2018?
 5        A    Maybe around $400,000.
 6        Q    How about 2017, what were the earnings
 7   gross and net that year, as best you know?
 8        A    I'm not sure.
 9        Q    Would it have been fairly consistent with
10   2018, or do you think it would have been more or
11   less?
12        A    It's hit or miss -- it's hit or miss
13   around here.  Dad was kind of semiretired, so -- I
14   mean, he was already taking Social Security.  He
15   took that early.  So it just depends on what's
16   going on in the market, and so it's not -- it was
17   never consistent, no.
18        Q    Who would have access to the financial
19   records that would show us what the earnings were
20   from your dad's various businesses?
21        A    Myself for the Randolph West Builders and
22   the Trident, and Joe Buckles for the Seacoast.
23        Q    Did your dad or you use an accounting
24   firm to handle the taxes for Randolph West
25   Builders?
0030
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Did you guys prepare and do your own tax
 3   returns?
 4        A    For Randolph West Builders, yes.
 5        Q    And did that continue to be true after
 6   you left the business in 2012?  Your dad at that
 7   time just did his own taxes?
 8        A    Yes, he would have.
 9        Q    You mentioned that you would be the
10   person most knowledgeable about the tax records or
11   accounting records for that business.  Do you still
12   have possession of those somewhere?
13        A    Bank statements only.
14        Q    You told me that at the time of this
15   incident, your dad was already on Social Security?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    What other sources of income did he have
18   other than what he was earning through Randolph
19   West Builders and the various other businesses that
20   you told me about?  Any other sources?
21        A    No.
22        Q    And do you know what his earnings were
23   from Seacoast or from Trident, LLC?
24        A    Trident was making nothing, and it may
25   have -- it may have netted one year $6,000 at best,
0031
 1   but it was just a -- it wasn't set up to make
 2   money; it was just a property holder.  It was
 3   supposed to be investment and a turn.  Seacoast, I
 4   don't -- I really know what he was getting out of
 5   Seacoast.
 6        Q    That would be something maybe Mr. Buckles
 7   would know?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Had your dad ever talked about
10   retirement?
11        A    Not really, other than he was probably
12   going to just keep going 'til he could -- you know,
13   as long as he could.  He was very healthy and very
14   young for his age and very active.
15        Q    There was some testimony yesterday that
16   perhaps your dad postponed retirement because he
17   was interested in trying to help you rebuild your
18   house after the fire.  Did that ever happen?  Did
19   you ever have that discussion?
20        A    No.  I never heard that before.
21        Q    Did you ever have any talks with your dad
22   about helping you rebuild or get a new place after
23   your home burned?
24        A    Yes.  He was going to do it for me at
25   cost, so we were going to pay him to build it and
0032
 1   try to do it at cost if we could.  But yeah, we
 2   were -- you know, we were going to pay for the
 3   labor and the materials.
 4        Q    In answer to one of my questions a moment
 5   ago, you described your dad as very young for his
 6   age and very active.  Is that correct?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    To your knowledge, did your dad have any
 9   health issues?
10        A    Not to my knowledge, no.
11        Q    Was he on any medications at the time of
12   his death that you know of?
13        A    I would say no, but that's not to my
14   knowledge.
15        Q    Had your dad ever been hospitalized
16   during any period of time that you're aware of?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Had your dad ever had any surgeries that
19   you know of?
20        A    Other than having a cyst removed off his
21   back, that's -- and not Lasix -- eye -- it's not
22   glaucoma.
23             MR. TINSLEY:  Cataract?
24             THE WITNESS:  Cataract, that's it, yeah.
25   BY MR. WRAY:
0033
 1        Q    Did your dad have a family doctor, anyone
 2   that he saw regularly?
 3        A    I don't think he saw anybody regularly.
 4   I know he probably saw Mikkelson a couple of times,
 5   but he was not the type of person to go to the
 6   doctor much.  I mean, he'd have to be really
 7   injured or really hurt to go to the doctor, and I'm
 8   kind of the same way too.  We're pretty strong
 9   people.
10        Q    You mentioned Dr. Mikkelson.  Is he a
11   family practitioner?
12        A    He's a GP, general practitioner.
13        Q    Is he located here in Bluffton?
14        A    Yes, he is.
15        Q    What type of hobbies or activities did
16   your dad like to do outside of work?
17        A    He was a fisherman, sporting fisherman.
18        Q    What kind of fishing did he do?
19        A    Deep sea.
20        Q    Did you ever go with him?
21        A    Not out there, no.  I was a more inshore
22   fisherman.  I got to be in control of my -- if I
23   need to go home, I need to go home.
24        Q    How about your sister Leigh, did she fish
25   with your dad?
0034
 1        A    A few times, yes, occasionally.
 2        Q    And in terms of being a fisherman, was
 3   that just a hobby, or did he do that as any type of
 4   business?
 5        A    No.  He actually years ago was a judge
 6   for ESPN Sports, and he did tournament judging in
 7   South America.
 8        Q    I know your dad owned at least one boat.
 9   How many boats did he have?
10        A    At one time, probably two.
11        Q    How many did he have at the time of his
12   death?
13        A    Just the one Boston Whaler.  He had
14   already sold his catamaran earlier in the year.
15        Q    You mentioned the catamaran.  Was your
16   dad a sailor as well as a fisherman?
17        A    No.  It was a catamaran sport fishing
18   boat.  He designed it and built it.
19        Q    What else did he like to do?  Liked to
20   fish?  I understand from Leigh yesterday he was a
21   very hard worker.  What else did he do?
22        A    Yeah.  I think he was what you call a
23   piddler, little projects, making furniture, just,
24   you know, little piddly stuff, gardening, fixing my
25   stuff, her stuff, whatever was broken down, fixing,
0035
 1   always fixing stuff.
 2        Q    Which address were you at at the time of
 3   the accident?
 4        A    I was at the 11 Palmetto Beach Lane.
 5        Q    And how far was that from your dad's
 6   residence at 8 Myrtle Island Road?
 7        A    The next road over.
 8        Q    Just estimate.  Is it a quarter mile,
 9   half mile, or less than that?
10        A    Less than a quarter of a mile.  It's just
11   the next road, a block.
12        Q    When you guys moved to Bluffton from
13   Augusta, did you move to the 8 Myrtle Island Road
14   address?
15        A    No.
16        Q    When did you move to that address?
17        A    I'd estimate '83, 1983.
18        Q    And who lived there at the time when you
19   first moved?
20        A    My sister and I, my mother, and my
21   father.
22        Q    My understanding is that occasionally
23   your dad would burn materials in the backyard of
24   that house in what I'll describe as a burn pile.
25   Does that sound familiar to you?
0036
 1        A    He burned sticks and stuff like that.
 2        Q    Had he done that throughout the time that
 3   you guys lived at the Myrtle Island Road address?
 4        A    What do you mean?  The 15 Myrtle Island
 5   address?
 6        Q    No, no.
 7        A    Oh, you mean the 8 Myrtle?
 8        Q    Where he lived.  He lived at 8 Myrtle
 9   Island Road.
10        A    I don't really recall when I lived there
11   if he was doing it or not.
12        Q    Yeah, and that's what I wanted to --
13        A    I really don't.
14        Q    As a child when you were growing up, did
15   your dad burn stuff in the backyard in a burn pile?
16        A    I'm sure he did, but I don't really
17   remember the actual burning of the pile, no.
18        Q    Tell me a little bit about your dad and
19   Gayla.  When did they meet?
20        A    2015, late 2015, I think.
21        Q    Do you know how they met?
22        A    They met at the Little Red Wagon.  I
23   think she was a vendor there, and from what I
24   understand, she also lived there.  There was an
25   apartment in there.
0037
 1        Q    Do you know if someone introduced them or
 2   they just kind of bumped into each other while your
 3   dad was down there one day?
 4        A    They were introduced by Joe Buckles.
 5        Q    When were your dad and Gayla married?
 6        A    October 2016.
 7        Q    So if they met in 2015, they married in
 8   2016, did they date about a year?
 9        A    I'm sorry?
10        Q    I said -- I think you told me he met her
11   in 2015, and they were married in 2016, so I said
12   did they date about a year before the marriage?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Did they live together for any period of
15   time before they were actually married?
16        A    Not -- I believe she moved into the
17   house, the main house, a couple months before.
18        Q    When you're referring to the main house,
19   you're talking about the 8 Myrtle Island address?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    When did you first meet Gayla?
22        A    Fourth of July weekend that same year.
23        Q    2015?
24        A    '16.
25        Q    Prior to that Fourth of July
0038
 1   get-together, were you aware that your dad was
 2   dating Gayla?
 3        A    He said he had a friend named Gayla.
 4        Q    What was your impression of your dad and
 5   Gayla's relationship prior to the marriage?
 6        A    He seemed pretty smitten with her, and I
 7   guess vice versa.
 8        Q    Did you ever talk with your dad about his
 9   relationship with Gayla prior to the marriage?
10        A    Yes, because we really didn't know her
11   very well, so yeah, I just wanted to make sure that
12   he was going to be happy.
13        Q    Did you ever try to discourage your dad
14   from marrying Gayla?
15        A    No.
16        Q    In some of the materials that we've been
17   given in this case, there's been some references to
18   perhaps you requested that your dad get a prenup
19   with Gayla prior to the marriage.  Is that true?
20        A    I never told him to get a prenup.
21        Q    Did you ever have that discussion with
22   your dad?
23        A    We had -- I was with him on a meeting
24   about that type of discussion with his attorney.
25        Q    So who brought up the subject then?
0039
 1        A    Roberts Vaux.  He was dad's attorney at
 2   the time.
 3        Q    Were you supportive of the notion that
 4   your dad should get some type of prenuptial
 5   agreement with Gayla before the marriage?
 6        A    Yes, if that's what he wanted.
 7   Otherwise, that's his business.  It wasn't any of
 8   my business.
 9        Q    So as I understand what you're telling
10   me, Ms. West, it's your testimony you neither
11   encouraged or suggested that your dad get a prenup?
12        A    No.  I never told him.  I told him if he
13   wanted to secure things, to get it in writing, but
14   if he wanted -- he didn't want -- he just needed to
15   make sure that his intentions were known.  That's
16   all I'd said to him.  But I never mentioned the
17   word prenup or said get a prenup, no.
18        Q    Did you have any type of ownership
19   interest in any of the businesses your dad owned?
20        A    No.
21        Q    You mentioned that you worked briefly as
22   a bookkeeper for the contracting business, but was
23   that the only business association you had with
24   your dad?
25        A    Yes.  And I didn't take a paycheck.  I
0040
 1   just, you know -- if I needed something for
 2   something, then that's kind of how it went.  We
 3   tried to help each other.
 4        Q    My understanding is that your dad did, in
 5   fact, have some type of prenuptial agreement with
 6   Gayla.  Is that accurate?
 7        A    That's correct.
 8        Q    And from some of the testimony yesterday,
 9   I understand that's what the current litigation
10   between the estate and Gayla revolves around.  Is
11   that right?
12        A    And the will, yes.
13        Q    Did you actually attend the marriage, the
14   wedding?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Where did they get married?
17        A    At the John the Baptist Church here in
18   Bluffton.
19        Q    Was it a big wedding, meaning all the
20   family and friends came, or was it just a small
21   service?
22        A    No.  It was just my sister and I and my
23   children -- I'm not sure if my husband was there, I
24   think my husband may have been there -- and Gayla
25   and dad.
0041
 1        Q    And after your dad and Gayla were
 2   married, did you have occasions to spend time with
 3   them as a married couple?
 4        A    Not much.  Occasionally, yes.
 5        Q    How often would you say that you
 6   interacted with your dad and Gayla together?
 7        A    Maybe once every couple of weeks.
 8        Q    And what would be the occasions for those
 9   visits, just stopping by to see your dad or him
10   coming by to see you?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    During the I guess it was about two years
13   that your dad and Gayla were married, did you form
14   any type of impression about their relationship and
15   their marriage?
16        A    I assume they were happy.
17        Q    Did you see any evidence to the contrary
18   that led you to believe that maybe this was an
19   unhappy marriage or they were having difficulties?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Did your dad ever discuss with you or
22   share with you that he was having any marital
23   difficulties with Gayla?
24        A    No.
25        Q    How would you describe your personal
0042
 1   relationship with Gayla?
 2        A    Friendly.
 3        Q    Did that ever change at any point in time
 4   prior to your dad's death?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    Did you ever have any arguments or
 7   disputes that you can recall with Gayla prior to
 8   the -- prior to your dad's death?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    How about your sister Leigh, how was her
11   relationship with Gayla?
12        A    Probably about the same, but she didn't
13   come around much.  We don't see her much.  She
14   works a lot.  And I live in the neighborhood.
15        Q    Who actually initiated the litigation
16   between the estate and Gayla?  Is that something
17   your family filed, or did Gayla file claiming
18   against you guys?
19        A    Gayla.
20        Q    And have you had any interactions with
21   Gayla since your dad's death?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    What type of involvement have you had
24   with her, other than in connection with the
25   lawsuit?
0043
 1        A    Really just trying to support each other.
 2        Q    Has that changed recently with the filing
 3   of litigation between you guys?
 4        A    Yes, yes.  Once attorneys got involved,
 5   the communication kind of stopped.
 6        Q    When's the last time that you actually
 7   spoke with Gayla?
 8        A    Probably late January of this year.
 9        Q    Was that when the lawsuit was filed
10   around January of 2019?
11        A    I'm not sure.  I would think so.
12        Q    Has there been any type of order entered
13   by the court that prohibits you guys from talking
14   or interacting with Gayla?
15        A    Not that I know of, no.
16        Q    So in terms of your lack of communication
17   or lack of involvement with her, that's just y'all
18   have both kind of decided mutually it's best not to
19   interact while the lawsuit's going on?
20        A    Just taking attorney advice.
21        Q    What did you do, if anything, to prepare
22   for today's deposition?
23        A    Nothing.  I think I had a stiff drink
24   last night.  That's about it.
25        Q    Did you have an opportunity to meet with
0044
 1   your lawyers?
 2        A    Briefly, but a phone call and letting me
 3   know what was going on and what I needed to bring
 4   to the table, the discovery stuff.
 5        Q    And I don't want to know about any
 6   communications you may have had, but just who did
 7   you communicate with?  Was it Mark or Brady?
 8        A    Brady.
 9        Q    How long did you guys talk before the
10   deposition?
11        A    I don't know, maybe ten minutes.
12        Q    Did you talk to your sister prior to
13   coming here today about her deposition yesterday?
14        A    No.  We didn't talk about the deposition.
15        Q    Did you talk to her at all?
16        A    Briefly.
17        Q    But your testimony is it didn't relate to
18   her testimony or anything she was asked yesterday?
19        A    No.
20        Q    And then I assume it's fair to say you
21   didn't talk to Gayla about her deposition
22   yesterday?
23        A    No.
24        Q    As I understand it from the papers that
25   have been filed, you are serving as the personal
0045
 1   representative of your dad's estate, and you are
 2   the party bringing this lawsuit against Walmart.
 3   Do you understand that?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    How was it determined or decided that you
 6   would be the personal representative?
 7        A    I'm named personal representative in my
 8   father's will.
 9        Q    And my understanding, I think you're the
10   older -- oldest child?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    How old are you, Ms. West?
13        A    51 fabulous years.
14        Q    Other than this case against Walmart and
15   the estate's claims with Gayla, is there any other
16   litigation that you know of involving your dad's
17   estate?
18        A    Not currently, no.
19        Q    Have any other claims been filed against
20   any other person or entity relating to your dad's
21   death?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    Who else have you filed a claim against?
24        A    Oh, I have not filed a claim against
25   anybody.  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand the
0046
 1   question.  Do you want to repeat it?
 2        Q    Yeah, yeah.  I was saying other than this
 3   lawsuit and the litigation involving Gayla and the
 4   estate, is there any other litigation involving
 5   your dad's estate that relates to this incident?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    You haven't filed a claim against any
 8   other person or party claiming that they're
 9   responsible for your dad's death?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Have you received any insurance proceeds
12   of any type related to your dad's death?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Have you received any compensation from
15   any source related to the accident involving your
16   dad?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Now, one of the things that we as lawyers
19   do in a lawsuit like this is we serve questions on
20   the other side asking them for information, and we
21   ask for documents.  Have you been involved in that
22   process as the personal representative of your
23   dad's estate?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    And in this case, have you received or
0047
 1   been asked to look at any requests we have made
 2   asking for documents in your possession?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Have you reviewed your files, records,
 5   everything you have to provide to your attorneys
 6   everything that you have that may be responsive to
 7   those requests?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    We're going to transition now to talk a
10   little bit about the incident involving your dad.
11   Do you want to take a short break before we do
12   that, or do you want to keep going?
13        A    Yes.  I need to check my makeup.
14        Q    Let's take a break.
15        A    Thank you.
16             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
17        9:59 a.m.
18                  (A recess transpired.)
19             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  On the record at
20        10:03 a.m.
21   BY MR. WRAY:
22        Q    Ms. West, as I told you just before the
23   break, I now want to ask you some questions about
24   the date of the incident involving your father.
25   And I know at points this is going to be difficult,
0048
 1   so as I told you, please feel free to take breaks,
 2   ask for breaks as you need them.
 3             So let's just start at the beginning.  Do
 4   you recall the date that the incident happened?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    What was the date?
 7        A    November 18, 2018.
 8        Q    And my understanding is that was a Sunday
 9   morning?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Were you at home on the morning of the
12   incident?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    And at that time you were at that
15   11 Palmetto Drive address?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    And I think you told me that was about a
18   block away from your father's house?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    What was the first information or notice
21   you had that something had happened at your
22   father's residence?
23        A    I heard the sirens first, but I wasn't
24   sure if it was the house, and then Jim Odum called
25   me from Gayla's phone.
0049
 1        Q    Were you still in bed when you heard the
 2   sirens?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Approximately what time of the morning
 5   was it?
 6        A    It was probably between 7:30 and 7:45.
 7   It was before 8:00.
 8        Q    Had you seen your dad on the day before
 9   that Saturday?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Do you have any knowledge about what his
12   activities were on the day before?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Do you have any knowledge of what his
15   activities were on the morning of November 18 prior
16   to when you heard sirens?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Jim Odum, you said, called you shortly
19   after you heard the sirens, and my understanding is
20   Mr. Odum was your dad's next-door neighbor?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Were they also pretty good personal
23   friends?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    Who else was at your home when Mr. Odum
0050
 1   called?
 2        A    My children.
 3        Q    Did you actually answer the call from
 4   Mr. Odum, or did somebody else answer and give the
 5   phone to you?
 6        A    I was on the -- my husband was in DC.  I
 7   was on the phone with my husband, and the call came
 8   through, and I'd already heard the sirens, and once
 9   I saw Gayla's name come up, I said, "Oh, my God.  I
10   got to go."  I knew something was wrong.
11        Q    When you said you were on the phone with
12   your husband, was that talking with him about just
13   his trip or his -- whatever business took him to
14   DC?
15        A    No, just checking in.
16        Q    Okay.  You weren't talking to him about
17   your dad or what might be happening in the
18   neighborhood?
19        A    No.  Didn't know.
20        Q    So you were on the phone with Eric, and
21   call waiting showed that it was Gayla's number?
22        A    Uh-huh, yes.
23        Q    You told me first off that Jim Odum
24   called, but it was Jim calling from Gayla's phone?
25        A    Yes.
0051
 1        Q    Is that the way it worked?
 2        A    Yes, yes.
 3        Q    Tell me first off, before you heard the
 4   sirens in your neighborhood, did you hear a boom or
 5   any type of noise that you believe was coming from
 6   the neighborhood?
 7        A    No.  I heard the sirens because I was
 8   outside.  I don't think I would have heard anything
 9   if I was inside the house.
10             Actually, let me back up.  I was not in
11   bed when I heard the sirens.  I took the dogs out,
12   heard the sirens, and then paused and then went
13   back inside and laid back in the bed and then got
14   the call.  I was on the call.
15        Q    Did you have a regular routine in terms
16   of when you took the dogs out each morning?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    About what time -- about what time was it
19   your typical routine to take the dogs out?
20        A    Usually between 7:00 and 7:30, trying to
21   make them wait as long as possible because they
22   bark too much.
23        Q    So that was what happened this particular
24   morning?  You got up as you typically do, took the
25   dogs out between 7:00 and 7:30?
0052
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And were you still outside with the dogs
 3   while you were talking to your husband on the
 4   phone?
 5        A    I think he called me when I got back in
 6   the house, but I'd heard the sirens, brought the
 7   dog -- and paused to try to determine where it
 8   stopped.  We have sirens coming through, I mean, a
 9   lot because a lot of people in the neighborhood are
10   older, so -- and we all know each other, so when we
11   hear it, we're -- you know, we're alert, trying to
12   figure out if it's a neighbor or somebody that we
13   know, but I didn't -- couldn't determine where it
14   was, so I think I didn't get on the phone 'til I
15   went back in the house.
16        Q    And you kind of touched on one of the
17   things I was going to ask you is I'm like a lot of
18   people, be a nosy neighbor, when you hear something
19   in your neighborhood, you crane your neck or look
20   to try to see what's going on and where it's
21   happening.  Did you do that before you went back
22   inside?
23        A    You can't see where I am.  There's a
24   privacy fence, so -- but Dad's house is back over
25   on the next block.
0053
 1        Q    So as you were in the backyard walking
 2   your dogs, you're not able to see your dad's
 3   residence from there?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    Do you know -- or were you able to see
 6   any evidence that your dad had a fire going or
 7   anything burning in his yard that morning before
 8   when you first heard sirens?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    So you're on the phone with Eric, and you
11   see a call coming in from Gayla's number.  Tell me
12   what happened next.
13        A    I just said, "I got to go."  I started
14   screaming.  The next thing I know, my two -- my
15   landlord, who's a friend of mine, and one of my
16   other friends were beating on my door, because they
17   had already caught wind of it and were coming, you
18   know, to get me.
19        Q    When you picked up the call from Gayla's
20   number and it was Jim Odum on the line, what did
21   Jim say to you?
22        A    I really don't recall.  I think he said
23   there's been an accident, and I don't remember any
24   details.  It's a blur.
25        Q    Do you recall whether Jim gave you any
0054
 1   details about what had happened?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    You mentioned that you began screaming
 4   almost immediately.  What was it about what Jim
 5   said that caused you to scream?
 6        A    He just said there's been an accident,
 7   and I'd already heard the sirens, so I knew
 8   something -- and then my friend was at the door
 9   saying it's really bad, and I screamed for my son
10   to come with me.
11        Q    Do you recall whether Jim told you that
12   whatever the accident was involved your dad, or
13   Gayla, or who might have been involved?
14        A    I don't recall.  He just said there's --
15   I can't even remember what he said.  I really
16   can't.  I know he said something that, "There was
17   an accident, and your dad's hurt."  I don't know if
18   he said he was burned.  I can't remember.
19        Q    Do you remember if Jim mentioned anything
20   about anybody being on fire or there being a fire
21   at your dad's residence?
22        A    I believe he said he'd been burned.
23        Q    Any other details that you can share from
24   that initial call from Mr. Odum?
25        A    No.  I'm pretty sure I dropped the phone.
0055
 1   As soon as he said accident, burn, whatever, I
 2   didn't talk to him any further.
 3        Q    Were your children up when you received
 4   the first phone call from Mr. Odum?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    And then you mentioned that you started
 7   screaming.  Did that awake the children?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    And tell me what discussion, if any, did
10   you have with your kids about what was going on?
11        A    I just said, "Luc, get up.  Papa's been
12   in an accident.  Get up."  That's all I remember.
13        Q    Then you said your neighbor and your
14   landlord or a friend and your landlord began
15   knocking on your front door?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Who was that?
18        A    Catherine Donaldson and Geist Ussery.
19        Q    How do you spell Geist?
20        A    Geist is G-E-I-S-T, Ussery, U-S-S-E-R-Y.
21        Q    Which one was your landlord?
22        A    Catherine.
23        Q    And where did Ms. Donaldson live?
24        A    In front of me, same property.
25        Q    So does your property have two different
0056
 1   residences?
 2        A    It's a guest house.  It's a guest house.
 3   I was living in her guest house.
 4        Q    How about Mr. Ussery, where did he live?
 5        A    He lives on Confederate Avenue.
 6        Q    How far was that from where you were
 7   living at that time?
 8        A    Probably two blocks, maybe three.
 9        Q    How long would you estimate it was
10   between when Mr. Odum called you to when Mr. Ussery
11   and Ms. Donaldson came to your front door?
12        A    Immediately after I dropped the phone,
13   they were already beating on the door.
14        Q    What, if anything, do you recall
15   discussing with Ms. Donaldson and Mr. Ussery?
16        A    I just -- she just looked at me and just
17   said, "It's really bad."  She was a firefighter, so
18   she knew.
19        Q    So is it your recollection that
20   Ms. Donaldson was doing most of the talking?
21        A    That's all I remember her saying to me.
22        Q    Did Ms. Donaldson share with you any of
23   the details that led her to tell you things looked
24   bad, what she had seen or what she'd observed?
25        A    No, no.  I think she may have talked with
0057
 1   Tom Vezzosi, who was on the site, or on the scene.
 2   I'm not even really sure how she even knew.  I
 3   don't know.  Like I said, we know everybody in the
 4   neighborhood, so someone had called somebody, and
 5   that just kind of prompted everything, you know, to
 6   come get me and --
 7        Q    Did Ms. Donaldson indicate to you whether
 8   she had actually been over to your dad's house
 9   before she came to your door?
10        A    She may have, but I don't recall.  We
11   haven't discussed it since.
12        Q    Was Mr. Ussery saying anything about what
13   he had heard or what he had seen over at your dad's
14   residence?
15        A    No.  I think my friend Druella had called
16   him because they heard the explosion.
17        Q    And you mentioned another name there,
18   your friend --
19        A    Druella.
20        Q    How do you spell that?
21        A    You like all these names?
22        Q    Yeah.  How do you spell her name?
23        A    We're all old southern over here.
24   D-R-U-E-L-L-A, Schultz.  She is a very good friend
25   and neighbor, and they're behind my dad's.  It's
0058
 1   all on the same block, so they had heard.
 2        Q    And do you know how Druella spells her
 3   last name?  Is it S-H-U-L-Z?
 4        A    It's S-C-H -- I got to think.
 5   S-C-H-U-L-T-Z.
 6        Q    I assume you were already up and dressed
 7   because you had taken the dogs out?
 8        A    Pajamas.
 9        Q    Did you have to change clothes or do
10   anything before you left the residence?
11        A    No.  I pretty much ran barefoot and
12   braless, which never happens unless there's an
13   emergency.
14        Q    And when you say you ran barefoot and
15   braless, I assume you're talking about to your
16   dad's residence?
17        A    Yeah.  I was trying to get there, but
18   then my friends coaxed me in the car.  I didn't
19   know how to get there fast enough, you know.
20        Q    Did you actually get in the car?
21        A    Yes.  Then they took me to the house, to
22   my dad's.
23        Q    So when you said you ran, you just
24   mean --
25        A    I ran --
0059
 1        Q    -- you ran out the front door?
 2        A    Yeah, I ran -- well, yeah.  I was running
 3   down the road, and they told me to get in the car.
 4        Q    Who picked you up?
 5        A    Geist.
 6        Q    Did your children go with you, or did
 7   they remain at your house?
 8        A    I can't recall if my son was with me.  I
 9   know the girls weren't.  I think it was just me in
10   the car.  It was just me in the car.  Luc came
11   later.
12        Q    When your neighbor and -- or your
13   landlord and your friend came to the house, how
14   long did it take you to actually get over to your
15   dad's residence?
16        A    Just a few minutes.
17        Q    You told me you'd already heard the
18   sirens, so is it safe to say that some type of
19   emergency vehicles were already at your dad's
20   residence?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Do you recall who was there?  And I don't
23   mean right now by name, but was it fire department?
24   EMS?  Police?  Which agencies were there?
25        A    I recall fire department agent -- fire --
0060
 1   I don't know if it -- it wasn't the chief.  I'm not
 2   sure who it was, but yeah, the fire department was
 3   there.  Dad was already gone.
 4        Q    Do you recall any other emergency
 5   response agencies that were there on site when you
 6   arrived at the house?
 7        A    Not that I know of.  I don't recall.
 8        Q    Did you -- you said you rode with Geist
 9   over.  Do you remember where he parked?
10        A    He came -- we parked up in the driveway.
11        Q    The driveway at your dad's house?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    And once you got the car stopped there in
14   your dad's driveway, where did you go?
15        A    I ran to Gayla yelling, "What happened?
16   What's going on?"
17        Q    Where was Gayla at that moment?
18        A    She was on the porch with two of her
19   friends and neighbors, sitting.
20        Q    When you say on the porch, talking about
21   the back porch?
22        A    Yes.
23                  (Defendant's Exhibit 10, Graphic of
24             Property, was marked for identification.)
25   BY MR. WRAY:
0061
 1        Q    Ms. West, I'm going to show you what we
 2   marked as Exhibit 10, and I'm going to tell you
 3   that this is a graphic that we just put together to
 4   help us at these depositions.
 5        A    Okay.
 6        Q    This is intended to be a representation
 7   of your dad's property there at 8 Myrtle Island
 8   Road with Myrtle Island I guess running in front of
 9   the house.  Is that correct?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    And then he had a driveway that went down
12   the side of his house to a shed or storage area in
13   the back?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    And I know it's not to scale, but does
16   this generally look like the layout for your dad's
17   property?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    I'm going to hand you a pen, and I want
20   to ask you first if you would just put an X on the
21   drawing where you remember Gayla was when you first
22   came up in the backyard.
23        A    (Witness complies.)
24        Q    And you told me she was sitting on the
25   steps.  It looks like there's an umbrella there on
0062
 1   the porch.  Was she kind of in that area where the
 2   umbrella was?
 3        A    No, closer to the -- the umbrella and the
 4   table and chair's in the corner.
 5        Q    Was her feet actually down on the brick
 6   area that goes around the back deck?
 7        A    No.  She was on the top step, sitting.
 8        Q    Was anybody with her?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Who do you recall being with Gayla?
11        A    Cathy Hester and Joann Rieser.
12        Q    Who is Ms. Hester?
13        A    She's an old family friend of ours and a
14   neighbor.
15        Q    She lived in the Myrtle Island Road
16   neighborhood?
17        A    They live on Nanny Cove Court, I think is
18   what it is, Court.
19        Q    How about Ms. Riester, I think you said?
20        A    Rieser.
21        Q    Rieser.
22        A    She also lives within the same vicinity,
23   on Nanny Cove.
24        Q    And did you -- did you actually park out
25   on the street and then come running down the
0063
 1   driveway to the back porch area?
 2        A    I think Geist pulled me up to the --
 3   close to the back, or mid-house.  I mean, that's
 4   kind of where everybody stops.
 5        Q    Did Geist get out with you?
 6        A    I don't recall.
 7        Q    Who else do you recall being in the area
 8   there where Gayla was besides Gayla, Cathy, and
 9   Joann and yourself?
10        A    I'm not sure.  I think Jim Odum was out
11   there, some other neighbors, a friend of ours
12   that's a fire/EMT.
13        Q    Did I understand you to say earlier that
14   when you got there and ran into the backyard/back
15   porch area, your dad was already gone?
16        A    Yes.  They had just left with him in the
17   ambulance.
18        Q    Did you ever at any time on the day of
19   this incident see your dad there in the backyard?
20        A    No, I did not.
21        Q    When you went into the backyard
22   initially, did you see any evidence of any type of
23   fire in the backyard?
24        A    I didn't go to the backyard.  When I knew
25   he was gone, I said, "I got to go," and I made
0064
 1   arrangements quickly to follow him wherever he was
 2   going.
 3        Q    So if I'm understanding you correctly,
 4   you kind of stopped where the deck and porch area
 5   was of the house.  Is that fair to say?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    But to make sure my question was
 8   answered, from where you were, could you see any
 9   evidence of a fire anywhere in the backyard?
10        A    No, no smoke, nothing like that.
11        Q    Did you smell anything that indicated to
12   you or suggested that there had been a fire there
13   that day?
14        A    I could smell gas, yes.
15        Q    And when you say you could smell gas, was
16   it a strong odor?  A faint odor?  How would you
17   describe it?
18             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
19   BY MR. WRAY:
20        Q    Go ahead.  You can answer.  He's just
21   preserving an objection for the record.
22        A    I mean, for smelling gas out in the air,
23   I think that's pretty significant.
24        Q    Could you tell the area where the gas
25   smell was coming from?
0065
 1        A    It was the backyard.
 2        Q    Any more precise than that, though?  As
 3   we look at our diagram here, could you tell was it
 4   coming closer back here where the shed area is and
 5   these trees and palm fronds, or was it closer up
 6   here to the deck where you were, or could you tell?
 7        A    I could just smell it from the deck.
 8        Q    You said that your recollection when you
 9   first encountered Gayla was you yelled out what
10   happened or what's going on, something to that
11   effect.  Is that correct?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    Did Gayla respond?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    What did she say?
16        A    She said that he was coming out to start
17   a fire, and she heard an explosion, and that was
18   all I got out of her because I said, "I got to go."
19        Q    When you say that Gayla said he was
20   coming out to start a fire, who are you talking
21   about?
22        A    My father.
23        Q    Did Gayla give you any other details
24   about how your dad was going to start the fire?
25        A    No.
0066
 1        Q    Did she give you any information about
 2   where he was going to start the fire?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    Did she indicate to you whether, in fact,
 5   he had actually started a fire that day?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did she share anything else with you
 8   about what had happened or what might have happened
 9   with your father beyond what you've already told
10   me?
11        A    No.  I didn't have time.
12        Q    How about any of the other people that
13   were there on scene, did anybody else respond to
14   your request for information about what had
15   happened or what was going on, other than Gayla?
16        A    No.  I left as soon as possible.
17        Q    Did you have any discussions that you
18   recall that morning with Ms. Hester or Ms. Rieser,
19   Mr. Odum -- I forgot Mr. Vinney's name, but the
20   other neighbor that was there.
21        A    Vezzosi.
22        Q    Vezzosi.  Anybody else while you were
23   there on this initial trip to the property?
24        A    No.
25        Q    How long would you say you were there in
0067
 1   the backyard area?  Because you told me you then
 2   turned to leave.
 3        A    Five minutes, if.
 4        Q    You didn't walk into the backyard area to
 5   do any type of inspection yourself to see what had
 6   happened?
 7        A    No.  My only interest was to go to the
 8   hospital and follow my dad to the hospital.
 9        Q    Do you recall seeing anywhere in the
10   backyard that day, on your initial entry into the
11   backyard, the presence of a gas can?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Any other conversation that you remember
14   that morning, other than asking Gayla what happened
15   and Gayla responding that your dad was trying to
16   start a fire and she'd heard an explosion?
17        A    No.
18        Q    No other details that you recall?
19        A    No.
20        Q    So you said you were there around five
21   minutes, and I know you're estimating, but --
22        A    Probably less, yeah.
23        Q    Tell me what you did next.
24        A    My friend took me back to my house, and I
25   packed a bag, got my son.  My friend Druella came
0068
 1   and got me to drive me to Augusta.  We'd heard that
 2   dad was being airlifted.  He had already been
 3   lifted to Memorial and was being airlifted to the
 4   burn center in Augusta, Georgia.  And then we went
 5   back and got Gayla, and I put her in the car with
 6   my son to drive behind us, so I rode with my friend
 7   Druella, and Gayla was in the car with Lucius.
 8        Q    Before leaving your dad's home, did you
 9   speak with any of the fire department officials or
10   other emergency response officials who had come to
11   the home that morning?
12        A    No.
13        Q    Did you get any details from any of the
14   emergency response folks about your dad's condition
15   or what was going on with him?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Who was it that took you back to your
18   house?  Did you go ride back with Geist?
19        A    Geist, yes.
20        Q    How long did you stay at the house before
21   you left there to head to Augusta?
22        A    I packed for a week.  I thought I was
23   going to go care for my father while he recovered.
24        Q    How long did that process take, do you
25   think, to pack your bags?
0069
 1        A    I did it as fast as I could.
 2        Q    Do you think less than 15 minutes or
 3   somewhere in that range?
 4        A    Yeah, I would say so.
 5        Q    You mentioned that your son left with you
 6   at that time?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    And I think Gayla told us yesterday that
 9   your son actually drove her or drove with her to
10   Augusta.  Is that correct?
11        A    That's correct.
12        Q    Consistent with your memory?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Who did you ride to Augusta with?
15        A    Druella Schultz drove me.
16        Q    Anybody else in the car besides you and
17   Druella?
18        A    No.
19        Q    Why did your son not ride with you?
20        A    Because he was driving Gayla.
21        Q    I guess to ask it a different way, why
22   did you and Gayla and Druella and Luc not all ride
23   in one vehicle?
24        A    Too hysterical.  I just thought it would
25   feed more panic.
0070
 1        Q    Between the time that you went back to
 2   your residence and you departed for Augusta with
 3   Druella, did you get any other information about
 4   what had happened with your dad?
 5        A    No details about the accident, no.
 6        Q    No details about what had happened to
 7   your dad?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    And no details about what his condition
10   was?
11        A    The only details I got, my cousin works
12   at the burn center, and it was a Sunday, so she
13   went in to find out what was going on and wait for
14   my dad to get there, so we'd have family there.
15   And then the burn unit called me and told me his
16   condition while we were en route.
17        Q    Who was your cousin that worked at the
18   burn center?
19        A    Christine Judson McDonnell, McConnell,
20   McDonnell.
21        Q    Christine Judson McDonald?
22        A    Yes.  Not Donald, Donnell, E-L-L at the
23   end.
24        Q    How did Ms. McDonnell learn about what
25   had happened to your dad?  Did you call her?
0071
 1        A    I may have texted her or called her,
 2   both.  I was trying to call all the family members
 3   I possibly could.  But she was the first one,
 4   because I knew she worked at the burn center.
 5        Q    How long, approximately, did it take you
 6   to get from your home in Bluffton to the burn
 7   center in Augusta?
 8        A    Probably two-and-a-half hours.
 9        Q    While you were driving to Augusta, were
10   you in conversation with other friends, family
11   members, perhaps emergency response folks?
12        A    Just my sister and I think Christine and
13   someone from the burn center and I think my
14   mother -- and my mother at some point.
15        Q    Leigh told us yesterday that she was in
16   Asheville, and I think she said she received a call
17   from you --
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    -- letting her know that something had
20   happened with your dad.  Is that what you remember?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Tell me what you recall about that
23   conversation.
24        A    I don't know verbatim word by word.  I
25   just said -- I mean, I was upset and said, you
0072
 1   know, "Dad's been in a horrible accident, and he's
 2   been severely burned, and I need you to come to
 3   Augusta."  I also communicated with Gayla while we
 4   were in the car too, back and forth, so --
 5        Q    Do you recall whether you called your
 6   sister Leigh before you left to go to Augusta?
 7        A    I didn't call her 'til we got in the car.
 8        Q    When you called Leigh that morning, was
 9   that the first notice she had gotten that something
10   happened with your dad?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    You also told me that you had been on the
13   phone earlier that morning with your husband, and
14   you were interrupted with the call from Gayla's
15   house.  Did you call your husband back and give him
16   any information about what was going on?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    And did he indicate to you what his plans
19   were or what he was going to do?
20        A    He was planning to come as soon as he
21   could, but he was in DC.
22        Q    Was he in DC on business, or was it a
23   personal trip?
24        A    No.  He has family.  His brother lives
25   there.
0073
 1        Q    So during the trip to Augusta, you called
 2   your sister at some point.  Was it just one time or
 3   multiple times?
 4        A    It could have been a couple of times.
 5        Q    Did you exchange any texts with your
 6   sister?
 7        A    I don't think so.
 8        Q    And you said you also talked to
 9   Christine, who was your cousin at the burn center?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Tell me what you recall about those
12   conversations.
13        A    She got to the hospital and told me that
14   dad had gotten there and that he looked like a
15   mummy and that it wasn't good.
16        Q    And was there other people at the burn
17   center you talked to other than Christine, or was
18   she the only one?
19        A    Someone from the burn center called me to
20   get his -- some of his history or whatever I could
21   articulate or knew about his health.
22        Q    That's what I wanted to clarify.  When
23   you say his history, they were trying to ask did he
24   have any medical issues?
25        A    Date of birth, that kind of stuff, yes.
0074
 1        Q    And then you said you also talked to
 2   Gayla a few times en route?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    What were those conversations about?
 5        A    I think I was just telling -- I think we
 6   were looking for phone numbers, if she had like my
 7   cousins Sky and Lynn, guys like my dad's -- it was
 8   like a brother to my dad, and we have friends in
 9   Augusta too, and I didn't have everybody's phone
10   number, so I may have talked to more people.  I
11   mean, we were just trying to -- I was trying to
12   call everybody that was close to us.
13        Q    Is it your recollection that most of
14   those conversations with Gayla were related to I
15   guess logistics of notifying friends and family
16   members?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Do you remember, during that trip over to
19   Augusta, getting any more details from Gayla about
20   what had happened with your dad?
21        A    No.  We never asked again.  That was the
22   last I had heard anything about the accident,
23   really.
24        Q    During your trip from Bluffton over to
25   Augusta, you said you may have sent a text or two
0075
 1   to Christine.  Any other text messages that you
 2   sent that morning?
 3        A    Just to let people know, maybe.
 4        Q    Those texts --
 5        A    My aunt, maybe.  But I think Christine
 6   was relying on her and my cousin Ginger to get the
 7   information to the rest of the family.  You know,
 8   Sunday mornings, people don't answer the phone.
 9        Q    Who do you recall sending any text
10   communications with that morning?
11        A    Probably Christine and Ginger.
12        Q    Do you still have the same phone you had
13   back in 2018?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    And who's your carrier?
16        A    Verizon.
17        Q    What's your number?
18        A    (843)368-5538.
19        Q    So perhaps you sent some text messages to
20   friends and family and let them know what was going
21   on.  Did you post anything to social media to kind
22   of let the broader crowd know that something
23   happened with your dad?
24        A    No.
25        Q    And I don't know what kind of social
0076
 1   media you do.  Are you a Facebook person?
 2        A    I do a lot of social media because of the
 3   chamber, but I try not to put out too much personal
 4   information if I can avoid it.
 5        Q    What other type of social media do you
 6   use besides Facebook?  Do you use Twitter?
 7   Instagram?  Snapchat?
 8        A    For business, for business, for the
 9   chamber.  I don't have personal accounts, no.
10        Q    So I think you answered my question, but
11   you don't use any personal -- you don't post any
12   personal photos or information on any of those
13   social media sources?
14        A    I do on my personal page, but I don't
15   have -- only Facebook.  I don't have a personal
16   anything else.
17        Q    Did you post anything on the morning of
18   your dad's incident on any social media accounts to
19   let people know what was going on?
20        A    I think I may have posted something after
21   he passed, posted a picture and said that he was
22   gone.
23        Q    Right.  That's a different question.
24   That's after he passed away.  The morning of this
25   incident, did you post anything to kind of alert
0077
 1   people that this had happened and --
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    He tells me we're out of time on the
 4   tape, so we'll take a short break and catch our
 5   breath.
 6             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the end of
 7        Media Number 1 in the deposition of Shellie
 8        West.  We are off the record at 10:35 a.m.
 9                  (A recess transpired.)
10             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the beginning
11        of Media Number 2 in the deposition of Shellie
12        West.  We are on the record at 10:45 a.m.
13   BY MR. WRAY:
14        Q    Ms. West, we took a short break there.  I
15   wanted to clarify one thing or make sure I
16   understood one thing.
17             You said you drove from your dad's
18   residence back to your home before heading to
19   Augusta with Geist.  Is that right?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    But then you rode from your home to
22   Augusta with Druella?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Did you have to wait for some period of
25   time for Druella to come pick you up before you
0078
 1   left, or was she already there when you got back to
 2   your house?
 3        A    No.  She came and got me while I was
 4   packing.  I think I had just finished packing.
 5        Q    Once you arrived in Augusta, who was at
 6   the hospital, if anybody, before you got there?
 7        A    My cousin Christine, my Aunt Barbara, her
 8   husband Jud.  I can't remember who was standing
 9   there when I got there.  I think Ginger and her
10   husband were there.  No, they were behind me.
11        Q    You mentioned your Aunt Barbara.  What's
12   her last name?
13        A    Judson.
14        Q    Was Barbara your dad's only sibling?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    She has a son named Clifton?
17        A    Yes.  She has four natural children and
18   two step.
19        Q    And is Clifton's last name Vaughan?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    What does he do?
22        A    I'm not sure.  He was in the military,
23   and he was selling some sort of tactical gear or
24   something.  He invented something for the military.
25        Q    Does he have some type of law enforcement
0079
 1   background, to your knowledge?
 2        A    He says he's got some experience with
 3   forensics, but I have been out of touch with him
 4   for many years.
 5        Q    Do you recall if he was present at the
 6   hospital when you arrived in Augusta?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Anybody else you recall being at the
 9   hospital when you got there?
10        A    I'm not sure who was there.  I know who
11   was there, but I don't know who was waiting when I
12   got there.  I think it was Barbara and Jud, and I
13   think Ginger was right behind me and Christine,
14   probably her husband, dad's friend Dale Duvall,
15   Sarah Lawhorn.  I don't know if Sarah's husband was
16   there.  But there was a group of people that beat
17   us there, because we have friends that live in
18   Augusta, and some of my family lives close to
19   Augusta, so they beat me there.
20        Q    Did you and Gayla arrive at about the
21   same time?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    And tell me what you did when you first
24   got to the hospital.
25        A    Went in the hospital.
0080
 1        Q    Who did you talk to, or who did you meet
 2   with?
 3        A    Christine.  She took me in.
 4        Q    What do you recall Christine telling you
 5   when you first arrived?
 6        A    I have no idea.  I can't remember.  I
 7   mean, just basically saying that he was sedated and
 8   that the doctors were going to come talk to us, and
 9   she took us into a waiting room to wait on the
10   doctors.
11        Q    Do you recall whether -- when you first
12   met up with Christine, was she meeting with you
13   one-on-one with a small group, or was she meeting
14   with the whole broad family and friend group?
15        A    Everybody that was there.
16        Q    And then was your family put in like a
17   private room just for y'all?
18        A    No.
19        Q    Where did you wait that morning as you
20   were trying to get news on your dad?
21        A    In a waiting room.
22        Q    While you were there that morning, did
23   you speak with anybody who shared any additional
24   details about what had happened with your dad?
25        A    No.
0081
 1        Q    Did you get any further information from
 2   Gayla about what had happened that morning?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    At some point that day, I assume you
 5   spoke with either the nursing staff or doctors at
 6   the hospital?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    What did they tell you?
 9        A    I can't remember details.  Basically, he
10   was burned 95 percent of his body, that for his
11   age, any kind of recovery would be unheard of, even
12   if he had -- was a young man, that he wouldn't have
13   been able to sustain the injuries, and that he was
14   going to be very disfigured, and that they had him
15   intubated.
16        Q    Did any of the medical professionals that
17   you spoke with indicate that they had been able to
18   speak with your dad to get any details directly
19   from him as to what had happened?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Do you recall any time while you were at
22   the hospital at any point that day any of the
23   medical professionals saying, "Your dad indicated
24   this is what happened"?
25        A    No.
0082
 1        Q    At some point, I believe your sister
 2   Leigh got there from Asheville?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Do you recall about what time of day it
 5   was when she got there?
 6        A    I don't remember, no.
 7        Q    What time do you think you got to
 8   Augusta?
 9        A    Maybe 10:00, 10:30, 10:30.
10        Q    And how long would you estimate that she
11   got there after you, a couple hours, or was it more
12   than that?
13        A    Well, she was further away, so I would
14   estimate, yeah, it'd have been a couple hours
15   behind me.
16        Q    Walk me through, then, the rest of the
17   day that you spent there at the Augusta burn
18   center.  What happened?
19        A    I couldn't tell you in succession.  It's
20   kind of a blur.  But I tried to stay -- after
21   they -- the doctors told us the initial diagnosis,
22   they came back in and basically said that he wasn't
23   going to survive or that, you know, we needed to
24   talk to hospice or whatever.
25             And I just said I need to get in there
0083
 1   with my dad.  He needs to hear my voice and know
 2   that I'm here.  So I tried to stay in the room with
 3   him as much as possible.  The only time I left the
 4   room was to talk to hospice and to get my sister.
 5        Q    Do you know about how long it was after
 6   you arrived in Augusta before they allowed you in
 7   to see your dad?
 8        A    No, probably -- it felt like eternity.
 9        Q    Tell me what his state was when you were
10   first allowed to go into his room.
11        A    He looked like a mummy, and he had a --
12   he was -- had a whatever you call it.  He was
13   intubated.  I don't know what they call it.  So he
14   couldn't talk or communicate with us.
15        Q    Was he in an ICU unit?
16        A    I assume that's what it was, yeah.
17        Q    When you first went in to see your dad,
18   did you go in alone, or did someone go with you?
19        A    I think my Aunt Barbara went in with me.
20        Q    Was your dad able to communicate with you
21   at all?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Did he ever open his eyes or indicate any
24   acknowledgment that you were there?
25        A    He -- I know -- I felt like he could hear
0084
 1   me because he did kind of -- he was flinching, but
 2   that could have been from the injuries, I'm not
 3   sure, but I felt like he could hear me.
 4        Q    And when you say you got a feeling or
 5   felt like he could hear you, what was he doing, or
 6   what was that indication to you?
 7        A    He was kind of -- you know, when I was
 8   talking, he was moving his legs.  I mean, he
 9   couldn't really move his arms or his hands, but I
10   was trying to hold his hand.
11        Q    Did your dad ever regain consciousness at
12   any time while you were there?
13        A    I felt like he was conscious at the time.
14        Q    What is it that --
15        A    He couldn't open his eyes, though.
16        Q    What was he doing --
17        A    They were too swollen.  He was
18   disfigured.
19        Q    What was he doing, if anything, that led
20   you to believe that he had some level of
21   consciousness?
22        A    Just I guess kind of flinching or moving
23   his legs a little.
24        Q    Anything else that you saw or observed
25   that led you to believe he might be conscious?
0085
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Did I understand you to say that once you
 3   were allowed in the room, they let you stay in
 4   there the rest of the time with your dad that day?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    And were other friends/family members
 7   coming in as well?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Who else do you -- you mentioned your
10   Aunt Barbara came in, I assume Leigh came at some
11   point, Gayla was there.
12        A    Gayla, a friend of hers, Beverly,
13   Druella, my cousin Jonathan, his wife Lynn, Ginger,
14   her husband Jim, Sarah Lawhorn, Dale Duvall, Pam
15   and Lee Lindsey, Barbara and Jud.  Did I say
16   Ginger?  I think Amber Hester was there, Amber
17   Kuehn, Amber Hester Kuehn, Christine.  I don't
18   think her husband was there.  I think that's it.
19        Q    Do you recall anybody who came in that
20   day to visit with your dad indicating that he
21   communicated in any way with any of them?
22        A    No.
23        Q    No, he didn't, or --
24        A    No.  Oh, my son Lucius was with us as
25   well.
0086
 1        Q    How long were you there at Augusta burn
 2   center that day?
 3        A    Until he passed.
 4        Q    What time was that?
 5        A    Which was around 6:00-something that
 6   evening.  We decided to take him off the
 7   ventilator.
 8        Q    And I understood from Gayla yesterday and
 9   perhaps Leigh as well that there was some
10   discussion between you and Leigh and Gayla about
11   what to do with your dad?
12        A    And my sister -- I mean and my aunt,
13   dad's sister Barbara, yeah.
14        Q    So it was kind of the four of y'all that
15   were making the decisions about what to do?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    And at some point that day, I understood
18   y'all decided to withdraw the life support?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    How long did your dad survive after that?
21   Do you know?  Do you remember when the decision was
22   made and when they actually pronounced him?
23        A    Probably less than 20 minutes.  We also
24   had a pastor come in.
25        Q    Was the pastor somebody there that worked
0087
 1   at the burn center or a personal --
 2        A    No.  My cousin Jonathan pulled him --
 3   called him, because it was a Sunday, which is
 4   weird, but I guess the pastor -- the hospital
 5   pastor was not there.
 6        Q    Once you were told that your dad had
 7   passed, did you immediately leave Augusta then, or
 8   did you stay there for some period of time?
 9        A    We were probably there another hour.  My
10   husband was not there yet, nor was Leigh's, so we
11   were waiting for them to get there.
12        Q    Was that so they could pay their respects
13   to your dad?
14        A    They were coming to support us and I
15   guess hoping to get there.  I mean, they didn't
16   know dad was -- no one knew -- we didn't know dad
17   was going to die.
18        Q    So you remained I guess 'til around
19   7:00 p.m.?
20        A    Yeah.
21        Q    And did you ride back to Augusta (sic)
22   with Druella?
23        A    I rode back with my son.
24        Q    When you got back to -- or did you go
25   straight from Augusta back to Bluffton?
0088
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    When you arrived back that night, did you
 3   go back over to your dad's residence at any time
 4   that evening?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    When was the next time you went to your
 7   dad's home after November 18?
 8        A    When I got up the next morning.
 9        Q    What was the reason that you went back
10   over to your dad's the next morning?
11        A    It was the right thing to do, support
12   Gayla and start talking about what we were going to
13   do for arrangements.
14        Q    Who went with you?
15        A    I think it was just me.
16        Q    When you went back the day following your
17   dad's incident, did you go in the backyard area at
18   that time, on that date, to see if you could see
19   anything to help you understand what had occurred?
20        A    I did look at the backyard.  I didn't --
21   I didn't walk the backyard.  I just looked at where
22   dad was, what I was told where he was when the EMS
23   got there.
24        Q    What was your purpose in doing that?
25        A    Closure.
0089
 1        Q    Who was it that gave you some information
 2   about where your dad had been that day?
 3        A    I'm not sure if anybody gave me the
 4   information.  I may have just walked back there,
 5   and I saw the pillow -- there were pillows on the
 6   ground, and the ground was burnt, and you could
 7   still smell the gas.
 8        Q    So I'm going to ask you to use Exhibit 10
 9   again, if you would, and use this pen, and first,
10   before you mark on it, show me the area where you
11   saw pillows on the ground.
12        A    What is that?
13        Q    That's supposed to be a little
14   fountain --
15        A    Oh, okay.
16        Q    -- in the backyard, and then I think
17   there's a garden area here to the left of the
18   fountain.
19        A    I think it was there.
20        Q    Before you mark it, just show me.  Where
21   were the pillows?
22        A    Oh, show you?
23        Q    Yeah, just show me.
24        A    I think it was right here, this area.
25        Q    Okay.  And then you said you smelled some
0090
 1   gas.  Where was the gas smell?
 2             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 3             THE WITNESS:  I could just smell it when
 4        I was -- when I walked out there.
 5   BY MR. WRAY:
 6        Q    All right.  So --
 7        A    I don't think it was coming from any --
 8   it just smelled like it was in the air.
 9        Q    If you would put a "P" in the area where
10   you saw --
11        A    (Witness complies.)
12        Q    And did you see one pillow or more than
13   one pillow?
14        A    Two.
15        Q    Were they burned or have any evidence of
16   being burned?
17        A    I didn't -- I didn't look at them.
18        Q    Did you -- at that point in time, did you
19   walk in the back area of the yard where this little
20   brown area is meant to represent the burn pile, did
21   you go back in that area of the yard?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Did you see on that occasion a gas can
24   anywhere in the yard?
25        A    Not that day.  I didn't walk in the back,
0091
 1   so I wouldn't have seen it.
 2        Q    How long would you say you spent in the
 3   backyard that day?
 4        A    I know a few minutes.
 5        Q    Less than five?
 6        A    Just kind of reflecting, yeah, because I
 7   went inside to speak to Gayla.
 8        Q    Was there anybody with you?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    When you went back inside, did you ask
11   Gayla about the pillows, what they -- why they were
12   there or what they were there for?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Did you get any other details from Gayla
15   that day about what had happened with your father?
16        A    No.
17        Q    When you went in the backyard the day
18   following the accident, was there any evidence that
19   you saw that there had been a fire the previous
20   day?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Did you see any areas of the ground that
23   were burned?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    Where were they?
0092
 1        A    Do you want me to mark it?
 2        Q    Well, show me with your -- first, and
 3   then we'll --
 4        A    Okay.  So, I mean, it just seemed like
 5   the whole yard was burnt.
 6        Q    Okay.  So just put a --
 7        A    Right here.
 8        Q    All right.  Put a circle around the area
 9   where you saw there was some burning.
10        A    Like this.
11        Q    Did you see any evidence of burning
12   anywhere beyond this tree here with the palm
13   fronds?
14        A    I didn't notice.
15        Q    And when you say you saw evidence of
16   burning, what exactly did you see?
17        A    The ground just looked burnt.
18        Q    Anything else that you saw that looked
19   like it had been burned or had been on fire?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Did you see a garden hose anywhere in the
22   backyard that looked like it might have been used
23   or attempted to be used?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    Where was the garden hose?
0093
 1        A    It was right here.  The spigot is right
 2   by the garden box, and then the hose was stretched
 3   out toward where dad was -- where I was -- where
 4   the pillows were.
 5        Q    Okay.  If you'd just write "hose" on that
 6   line so we'll know what that is.
 7        A    (Witness complies.)
 8        Q    Anything else you recall seeing?
 9        A    Not that day, no.
10        Q    Did you call anybody -- neighbors or
11   anyone -- to come over and give you any information
12   about what had happened?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Or to help you understand anything that
15   you were seeing that day?
16        A    No.
17        Q    And once you walked around the backyard,
18   you said you spent a few minutes back there, did
19   you go back in the house, and you spent the rest of
20   the time there that day talking with Gayla?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    How long do you think you spent at the
23   house the day following the accident?
24        A    Probably 'til evening, 'til it was time
25   to go to bed.
0094
 1        Q    And did you go back on subsequent days
 2   after the day following the accident to do any type
 3   of investigation yourself to try to see if you
 4   could determine what had happened?
 5        A    Yeah.  I mean, at some point I did look
 6   at the burn pile and kind of walk around to try to
 7   make sense of the accident.
 8        Q    When did you do that?
 9        A    I couldn't tell you.  I mean, it was --
10   it was probably within a couple of days, because we
11   didn't leave -- I mean, it wasn't left there long,
12   and we had a celebration there, so everything was
13   cleaned up.
14        Q    When was the service held for your dad?
15        A    Well, he died right before Thanksgiving,
16   so I think we did the what I call a wake the day
17   before at Sauls Funeral Home, and then the
18   following Sunday, our friends did a celebration at
19   the house.
20        Q    Do you remember what day that was that
21   you did the celebration?
22        A    The celebration was Sunday after
23   Thanksgiving.  I don't know the date.
24        Q    Do you know if they printed up any
25   bulletins or brochures or anything in connection
0095
 1   with that?
 2        A    I think Sauls Funeral Home would have had
 3   all that information on their website, and I
 4   think -- yeah, there was a program at the wake.
 5        Q    And Sauls Funeral Home, is that here in
 6   Bluffton?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    One thing I wanted to make sure I
 9   understood, Leigh told us yesterday that her
10   recollection was that when you guys got back from
11   the hospital, some folks had already cleaned up the
12   backyard so y'all didn't have to see any of the
13   stuff.  Is that different from what you recall?
14        A    I don't think it was the very next day.
15   I think it could have been that Tuesday.  It was --
16   yeah, it was cleaned up fairly quickly.  I mean, it
17   wasn't -- I mean, my husband and my cousin didn't
18   want people to see all that.
19        Q    Do you know who cleaned up the yard?
20        A    It would have -- it would have been my
21   husband Eric and my cousin Cliff.
22        Q    And what's your best recollection?  If
23   the incident happened on Sunday, when do you think
24   they went out and cleaned up the yard?
25        A    I don't know.  I'm going to estimate it
0096
 1   was like Tuesday, because it was pretty early, and
 2   I didn't -- I questioned why they did that because
 3   Leigh -- I don't think my sister even saw it.  Did
 4   she say -- I don't know.  I can't remember.  We
 5   haven't talked a lot about just the accident
 6   itself.
 7        Q    You said at some point within a couple of
 8   days of the incident, you did actually go in the
 9   back area of the yard where the burn pile was.  Is
10   that fair to say?
11        A    It was the next day after my dad passed
12   away, so it would have been that Monday morning,
13   November 19th.
14        Q    What did you see when you went back in
15   the area where the burn pile was?
16        A    Oh, the burn pile?
17        Q    Yeah.  That's what I was asking you.  Did
18   you get --
19        A    I thought you were asking me the same
20   question again.
21        Q    No, no.  Did you go look at the burn
22   pile --
23        A    At some point --
24        Q    -- the next day on the 19th?
25        A    -- I did, but I think everything was
0097
 1   already cleaned up when I back there, except for
 2   the -- except for the pile.  The pile was still
 3   there.
 4        Q    When is it that you think you went back
 5   there and actually looked at the pile?
 6        A    It could have been later that day.  It
 7   could have been the next day.
 8        Q    Later on the day of the 19th?
 9        A    But I know when I looked at it, I think
10   everything was already cleaned up, because all this
11   stuff was gone.  Where the pillows were, there were
12   bits of dad's clothing there.
13        Q    I'm just trying to get a time frame
14   established.  When you say later that day, are you
15   talking about later on the day of the 19th?
16        A    I don't know, but I know that it was
17   already cleaned up when I walked to the back of the
18   yard.  I mean, my husband could have cleaned it --
19   they could have done it that Monday.  I never
20   really asked him when he did it.
21        Q    When you walked back to check out the
22   burn pile, whatever day that was, did you see a gas
23   can in or around the area where the burn pile was?
24        A    I saw a diesel can.
25        Q    Where was the diesel can that you saw?
0098
 1        A    It was in the carport.
 2        Q    Just take this pen again and put a "D"
 3   where you recall seeing the diesel can.
 4        A    There's an overhang right here or -- this
 5   is open.  I think it was right here.
 6        Q    Was it under a covered area, or was it
 7   out in an open area in the yard?
 8        A    It was in a covered area.
 9        Q    Was the only can that you saw when you
10   walked back there the diesel can?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Did you see any indication or evidence
13   that the diesel can was damaged in any way?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Did you see any other gas cans in or
16   around the area of the burn pile?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Did you see any other gas cans anywhere
19   else on the property?
20        A    Not -- I didn't look for them that day,
21   no.
22        Q    Do you know who actually retrieved the
23   can that we've been told was involved in the
24   accident involving your dad?
25        A    Yes.
0099
 1        Q    Who retrieved it?
 2        A    My neighbor, Carlus Schultz, and Tabor
 3   Vaux.
 4        Q    And Tabor Vaux, is that the lawyer whose
 5   office we're at today?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    When did they retrieve the can that you
 8   understand was involved in your dad's accident?
 9        A    The day of the accident, from what I was
10   told.
11        Q    Do you know why they retrieved it that
12   day?
13        A    Carlus called -- he's a neighbor and
14   godfather to a couple of my children -- called
15   Tabor and asked him to come look at the can and the
16   scene.
17        Q    Is it Carla or Carlus?
18        A    Carlos -- Carlus, it's C-A-R-L-U-S,
19   Schultz.
20        Q    Did you ever talk with Carlus and ask him
21   why he called Tabor?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Did you ever ask Carlus or Tabor where
24   the can was found?
25        A    I just assumed they found it in the
0100
 1   backyard.  Tabor told me that they had gotten the
 2   can and secured it at Carlus's house.
 3        Q    Right, but the backyard is pretty large.
 4   Do you know where in the backyard -- did they ever
 5   indicate to you where in the backyard they found
 6   it?
 7        A    By the burn pile.
 8        Q    If you would draw a "G" on Exhibit 10
 9   where your understanding is the gas can that you
10   believe was involved in your dad's accident was
11   found.
12        A    I don't know where here.  It's somewhere
13   around here, near G.
14        Q    Okay.  Somewhere -- did you ever see the
15   gas can in the backyard area that was -- that is
16   claimed to be involved in this accident?
17        A    No.
18        Q    And do you know what they did with it
19   once they retrieved it?
20        A    It was bagged, and Carlus put it at his
21   house.
22        Q    Do you know how long it remained at
23   Carlus's house?
24        A    Less than a week.
25        Q    Where did it go from there?
0101
 1        A    To an investigator in Charleston.
 2        Q    Did you arrange to send it to the
 3   investigator, or was that done through lawyers?
 4        A    It was done through legal channels,
 5   wasn't sent.  It was -- I think he came and got it
 6   and took pictures.
 7        Q    At what point in time did you actually
 8   contact legal counsel?
 9        A    I think Tabor probably called me within
10   two or three days after -- maybe four after Dad
11   passed to let me know about it.
12        Q    Does Tabor actually represent you as
13   well?
14        A    On this case, yes.
15        Q    Okay.  So don't tell me about any
16   conversations you had with your lawyer, then, but
17   your recollection is Tabor contacted you, and then
18   somebody made arrangements for you to deliver the
19   gas can to an investigator to be looked at?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Was the first contact about having
22   lawyers get involved in this case, did that come
23   from the lawyers contacting you, or did you contact
24   a lawyer first?
25        A    Tabor is a friend of mine.
0102
 1        Q    So he was a personal friend before this
 2   happened?
 3        A    Yes, yes.  He was not retained as an
 4   attorney prior to that.
 5        Q    At what point did you actually retain
 6   counsel?
 7        A    I think it was November 29th, the day
 8   that we read the will.
 9        Q    And as you're looking at Exhibit 10
10   there, you said you did go in the backyard and
11   looked at the burn pile yourself.  Is the burn pile
12   on this diagram in the general area where you
13   recall the burn pile being?
14        A    Yes.  It looks close enough.
15        Q    Do you recall what was in it that your
16   dad had been burning that day?
17        A    It looked like sticks and bushes.  There
18   may have been a cardboard -- piece of cardboard on
19   there, from what I recollect.
20        Q    I'm going to show you what we marked
21   yesterday as Exhibit 3, and I'll represent to you
22   that's a photograph that your counsel provided to
23   us.  I believe that to be a picture of the burn
24   pile, but you tell me.  Does that look consistent
25   with what you saw when you went back there?
0103
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And does the materials on the burn pile
 3   appear to be what was there on the day that you
 4   looked at it, a day or two after this accident?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Did you see anything in the burn pile
 7   like glass bottles, any plastic containers?
 8        A    No.  I see gloves in these pictures, but
 9   that's from EMS.
10        Q    I asked you earlier in the deposition
11   whether you recalled when you were growing up at
12   the house whether your dad had a burn pile or
13   frequently burned things in the backyard, and I
14   think you told me you really weren't sure?
15        A    Well, I know he always burned stuff, but
16   I don't like recall the actual burning of stuff.
17        Q    After you grew up and moved out and your
18   dad continued to live there at the 8 Myrtle Island
19   address, do you recall that he had a fairly common
20   practice of burning stuff in his backyard?
21        A    Every so often when he was cleaning the
22   yard.  I mean, we all do it.
23        Q    What type of materials did he typically
24   burn in his burn pile?
25        A    Just raking from the yard and yard
0104
 1   debris.
 2        Q    Do you ever remember him burning any
 3   materials from a construction site that he might
 4   have been working on?
 5        A    No.  He wouldn't have done that.  Most of
 6   that stuff's like treated.  You can't do that.  He
 7   would have not done that.
 8        Q    I'm not that familiar with that.  Why did
 9   you say he wouldn't have burned stuff that was
10   treated?
11        A    He just -- he would not have anything
12   from a construction site coming to his house.  That
13   all stuff goes in dumpsters, and most contractors
14   would not burn any kind of material that has
15   treated or it has chemicals or something in it if
16   it's treated, but he wouldn't have brought
17   commercial materials or building materials to his
18   house.
19        Q    How about you?  Were you ever present
20   when your dad did any burning in a burn pile in the
21   backyard of that house?
22        A    Yeah, from time to time.
23        Q    Do you recall, on any occasion when you
24   were there with him, seeing him use any type of
25   accelerant to help get the fire going?
0105
 1        A    Yeah.  I mean, I know he always used
 2   something to get it going.  Sometimes he did and
 3   sometimes he didn't.
 4        Q    What type of accelerants did you see your
 5   dad use to get a fire started?
 6        A    I know he'd light the fat lighter and
 7   maybe charcoal lighter, sometimes kerosene.
 8        Q    Did you ever see your dad pour gasoline
 9   on a fire?
10        A    No.
11        Q    You said you did see him use kerosene on
12   occasion.  How many times did you see that?
13        A    I never actually saw him pour the
14   kerosene.  I just know that, just from talking to
15   him, what he used.  I'm not sure I've ever seen him
16   really pour it on there, but --
17        Q    What else did your dad indicate, in
18   talking with him, that he used to try and get fire
19   started in his burn pile?
20        A    Newspaper, maybe.  I don't know.
21        Q    And on the occasions when you were there,
22   how would your dad actually ignite the fire?  Did
23   he use a match?  Did he use a lighter?  What did he
24   use to get it started?
25        A    I would say probably a lighter.
0106
 1        Q    I'm asking what you actually saw.  Did
 2   you ever see --
 3        A    Oh, no.  I mean, yeah, I may have seen
 4   him light a fire.  I mean, I don't have total
 5   memory of it, but it's not something that you
 6   really -- you remember parties and good times.  You
 7   don't really remember people lighting fires with
 8   lighters, so -- but I know he probably used a
 9   lighter.  I don't think he ever had matches.  I
10   don't know.  He could have used matches.
11        Q    How many times would you say you were
12   present when you actually saw your dad start a fire
13   in the burn pile?
14        A    I couldn't tell you.
15        Q    More than five?
16        A    Maybe, maybe less.  I'm not sure.
17        Q    What's your best -- I know it's an
18   estimate.  What's your best estimate?
19        A    I don't have a clue.  I mean, I could
20   have walked up and he was already -- it was
21   already -- he was already doing something, you
22   know, over the years.  I mean, we've been living
23   side by side for, you know, 30 years.
24        Q    When your dad would burn things in his
25   backyard and you were only a block away, could you
0107
 1   typically see the smoke and evidence that he had a
 2   fire going over there?
 3        A    Yes, in the house at 17 Nanny Cove, not
 4   where I was living.
 5        Q    Say that for me again.  I didn't
 6   understand.
 7        A    I wouldn't be able to see it from where I
 8   was living, but in my old house, yes, I could see.
 9        Q    Right, from the 11 Palmetto --
10        A    From the 17 Nanny Cove.
11        Q    How close was the Nanny Cove address to
12   your dad's property?
13        A    We shared a gate from corners of our
14   property.  Actually, we kind of crossed Jim Odum's
15   yard a little bit in the back, but we had a gate
16   back there.
17        Q    If we look at Exhibit 3.  And it's a
18   little bit dark, but I'm going to ask you to look
19   back in that corner there, in the left-hand corner
20   near the top.  Do you see what appears to be a gas
21   can in that left-hand corner?
22        A    Yes.  That's the diesel can.
23        Q    That's where you recall seeing a diesel
24   can when you went out there a day or two after the
25   incident?
0108
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Did you ever ask anyone to come out on
 3   your behalf to do any type of investigation to try
 4   and determine what happened to your dad prior to
 5   counsel being involved?
 6        A    I did contact a friend at Beaufort County
 7   through personal channels to ask her to follow up
 8   and -- because we didn't have any report, and we
 9   didn't have any statements of witnesses, so I did
10   reach out to her.
11        Q    Who was that person?
12        A    Her name's Angela Viens.  We went to high
13   school together.
14        Q    When did you call Ms. Viens?
15        A    I think it was shortly after dad died.  I
16   didn't call her.  I messaged her through Facebook
17   and asked her to call me.
18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Excuse me, Counsel.
19        Sir, would you mind switching microphones with
20        her?
21             MR. TINSLEY:  I don't have a microphone
22        on.
23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  I was talking about
24        that one right now.
25             MR. THOMAS:  This one, right?  She needs
0109
 1        another microphone?
 2             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The microphone, when
 3        it fell, it kind of --
 4             THE WITNESS:  All right.  I have to
 5        charge for technical support, just so you
 6        know.  My time is not cheap either.  Just
 7        kidding.  Yeah, it's fallen a couple of times.
 8        That's what's happened.
 9   BY MR. WRAY:
10        Q    So at some point you contacted Ms. Viens
11   at the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office, and that
12   was because you felt like they hadn't gotten
13   statements or interviewed people?
14        A    Yeah.  I was just asking as a favor for a
15   friend, you know.  I didn't go -- I didn't call
16   Beaufort County.  I just messaged her through
17   personal Facebook and asked her to call me.
18        Q    Did you -- other than contacting your
19   friend who happened to be with law enforcement, did
20   you ask any friends, family members, or retain
21   anybody on your own behalf to come out and inspect
22   the scene, give you an assessment of it --
23        A    No.
24        Q    -- before counsel was hired?
25        A    No.
0110
 1        Q    I saw a reference in some of the records
 2   to your cousin Clifton Vaughan at some point maybe
 3   coming out to look at things and give an
 4   assessment.  Do you know anything about that?
 5        A    He came into town right after dad died,
 6   and he, you know, mentioned that things looked
 7   weird to him, but I haven't really -- I haven't
 8   talked to him since.
 9        Q    Did you ask Clifton to come and do that?
10        A    No.  I didn't even know he was coming.
11        Q    Do you know if he had any
12   background/experience/qualifications in fire
13   investigation?
14        A    No, I did not.
15        Q    When you say he told you that things
16   looked weird to him, what specifically did he tell
17   you?
18        A    He actually didn't tell me.  He said it
19   to my aunt.
20        Q    What did he tell your Aunt Barbara?
21        A    I think they were just questioning that
22   there was no -- there were no -- there was no kind
23   of investigation, because it was an accident at the
24   time, and dad passed away later.  There was never
25   really any follow-up, and there was no -- you know,
0111
 1   they were just asking about the scene being
 2   investigated, and far as I knew, it had not been,
 3   so that was the question.
 4        Q    Did you have any feelings yourself
 5   initially that what happened to your dad could have
 6   been anything other than an accident?
 7        A    No.
 8             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 9             THE WITNESS:  No.
10   BY MR. WRAY:
11        Q    Do you know of anyone who claims to have
12   been an eyewitness to what happened during the
13   accident with your dad?
14        A    Ask -- say that again.
15        Q    Do you know anyone who claims to have
16   been an eyewitness to the accident involving your
17   dad?
18        A    Well, there were a lot of people there.
19   I haven't had any discussion with anybody that was
20   there what happened.  It's been too heart-breaking,
21   so -- I just wanted the report.  I didn't want
22   to -- Jim and I can't even talk to each other right
23   to this day about it.  I don't know who claims are
24   an eyewitness, I mean, but there were other
25   neighbors that were there.  I don't think they were
0112
 1   there when it happened.
 2        Q    That's really what I was getting at right
 3   now.
 4        A    Right, yeah.  No one has claimed to be an
 5   eyewitness, no.
 6        Q    Okay.  My understanding is that Mr. Odum
 7   and some of the other neighbors came out after your
 8   dad was already injured.
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Is that fair to say?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    My question is do you know of anybody who
13   says, "I saw what he was doing at the moment he
14   became injured"?
15        A    No.
16        Q    Do you know anybody that has any
17   firsthand information about what happened to cause
18   him to be injured?
19        A    No.
20             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
21   BY MR. WRAY:
22        Q    I'm going to show you what we marked
23   yesterday as Exhibit 5 and ask you have you ever
24   seen the item in that picture before?
25        A    Yes.
0113
 1        Q    What do you understand that to be?
 2        A    That is a gas can.
 3        Q    Does that gas can have any particular
 4   significance, to your knowledge?
 5        A    Yeah.  It's split at the bottom, and it's
 6   red, and it's plastic, and it says "Gasoline" and
 7   "Danger" on it.
 8        Q    Do you know whether that is the gas can
 9   that you have alleged in your complaint, the
10   lawsuit filed in this case, that was allegedly
11   involved in your dad's accident?
12        A    Yes, that's the can.
13        Q    And you see a plastic looks like a
14   garbage bag underneath it?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Do you know was that what you were
17   telling me earlier, that your neighbor Carlus and
18   Tabor put it in that bag at some point?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Were you present when that happened?
21        A    No.
22        Q    As far as the gas can shown in Exhibit 5,
23   do you -- is it your belief that that gas can is
24   somehow involved in the incident involving your
25   dad?
0114
 1        A    Oh, yeah, yes.
 2        Q    Do you know where that gas can came from?
 3             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 4             THE WITNESS:  My father's backyard.
 5   BY MR. WRAY:
 6        Q    Had you ever seen that gas can at any
 7   time prior to the date of your dad's accident?
 8        A    Yeah.  I mean, there was -- Dad had gas
 9   cans.  I wouldn't say I particularly make notice of
10   that one can, but yeah, that's one of his cans.
11        Q    Do you know where your dad stored any of
12   the gas cans he had on his property?
13        A    Around in the shed, either in the shed or
14   around the shed or in the carport.
15        Q    Did he keep -- typically keep -- well,
16   let me ask it a different way.  How many cans did
17   he have on the property?  Do you know?
18        A    Whatever was there when we got over
19   there.  It could have been five or six.
20        Q    Did he typically keep all the cans in the
21   same area?
22        A    No, not always.
23        Q    We saw in Exhibit 7 the diesel can that
24   you told me was in that area when you went out
25   there.  Is that where the cans were typically kept,
0115
 1   or were they somewhere else?
 2             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 3             THE WITNESS:  I think he kept a few over
 4        there.  I mean, he kept them in different
 5        places.  It'd just depend on what he was doing
 6        at the time, I guess.
 7   BY MR. WRAY:
 8        Q    Do you understand that the gas can that's
 9   pictured there in Exhibit 5 was manufactured by a
10   company called Blitz?  Have you ever looked at that
11   to see who the manufacturer was?
12        A    When I saw the can at this point, yes.
13        Q    You understood it wasn't manufactured or
14   made by Walmart.  Is that fair to say?
15             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
16             THE WITNESS:  Yes.
17   BY MR. WRAY:
18        Q    Do you know where or how your dad came to
19   be in possession of the gas can initially?
20        A    We got most of them at Walmart.  I know
21   this particular can was dated 2002, and between he
22   and my husband and I, we always got those cans
23   there.  Wasn't any other -- a whole lot of stores
24   here back then, but they were cheap at Walmart, and
25   that's where we got them.
0116
 1        Q    Do you know who actually purchased that
 2   can?
 3        A    I'm not sure, could have been myself or
 4   my dad.
 5        Q    So I take it from that answer you're not
 6   positive who bought it.  Is that fair to say?
 7        A    It could be.  I mean, I would say he --
 8   majority of the cans he would buy himself, but
 9   there have been times when I bought cans like this
10   as well.
11        Q    The cans that you bought, did you buy
12   cans and then give them to your dad?  Is that what
13   you're telling me?
14        A    It could have been me making a run for
15   him because I worked with him.
16        Q    I'm just trying to understand.  When you
17   say you bought cans, did you buy cans for your
18   personal use, or you bought cans and then gave them
19   to your dad for some reason?
20        A    It could have been both.
21        Q    The particular can that we see in
22   Exhibit 5, though, you don't know whether you
23   bought it, your dad bought it, or who bought it.
24   Is that fair to say?
25             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
0117
 1             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it's -- between he
 2        and I, I couldn't tell you for sure.
 3   BY MR. WRAY:
 4        Q    How do you know that either you or your
 5   dad bought that particular can?
 6        A    I just -- I just know from -- we did
 7   everything together.  He and my husband and I, we
 8   were all in business together, and we lived near
 9   each other, and we just helped each other.
10        Q    Do you know what date the can was bought?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Do you know whether the can was bought in
13   an actual Walmart store or online?  What's your --
14        A    It would have probably more than likely
15   been bought at the Walmart on Hilton Head Island.
16        Q    When you say "more than likely," you
17   understand there are other places that sell these
18   exact same gas cans, do you not?
19             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
20             THE WITNESS:  Not here, not then.
21   BY MR. WRAY:
22        Q    What do you mean by that?
23        A    Well, we did a lot -- I mean, we did most
24   of our shopping at Walmart.  I mean, we didn't --
25   there was no other place to get this kind of can.
0118
 1        Q    Well, how do you know when the can was
 2   actually bought?
 3        A    I don't know when it was actually bought,
 4   but I know it came from Walmart.
 5        Q    How do you know --
 6        A    That's where we got those cans, because
 7   we always bought our gas cans at Walmart.
 8        Q    How do you know what other stores in the
 9   Beaufort/Hilton Head area might have sold that same
10   type of can?
11        A    I don't know that they did.  Walmart's
12   pretty cheap, so try to get everything we can from
13   there, back then anyway.
14        Q    Do you know how whoever bought the can
15   paid for it?  Was it cash?  Credit?  Debit card?
16   Do you know?
17        A    I'd say probably cash.  My dad used a lot
18   of cash.  We always used cash as much as possible.
19        Q    I'm going to show you what we marked
20   yesterday as Exhibits 6, 7, and 8, give you a
21   second to take a look at those.  Let's start with
22   Exhibit 6.  Are you familiar with any of the cans
23   shown in that picture?
24        A    Yeah, yeah.
25        Q    What do you understand those to be?
0119
 1        A    Those are different gas containers.
 2        Q    Where were those gas containers located?
 3        A    On the left-hand side of the apartment,
 4   or the carport apartment.
 5        Q    Let's go back to Exhibit 10.  If you can
 6   take your pen, and just let's put -- let's see.
 7   What is there, five cans in that picture?  Just
 8   put --
 9        A    (Witness complies.)
10        Q    That's fine.  Just put "five cans" there.
11        A    (Witness complies.)
12        Q    And then Exhibit 6 looks to be the diesel
13   can -- I'm sorry.  Exhibit 7, appears to be the
14   diesel can that we already looked at earlier.  Is
15   that correct?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    And then Exhibit 8 is just another
18   picture of these cans showing Exhibit 6.  Do you
19   see that?
20        A    Yes, yes.
21        Q    Would you agree with me that taking
22   Exhibit 6 and 7 together, there's five in
23   Exhibit 6, there's a diesel can in Exhibit 7, and
24   then the gas can that you say was involved in the
25   accident.  Altogether, that would be seven
0120
 1   different gas cans on your father's property?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    And my understanding from your testimony
 4   earlier is that either you or your dad or your
 5   husband bought all the cans, gas cans, at a Walmart
 6   here on Hilton Head?
 7        A    The older cans, yes.
 8        Q    The cans that are shown in Exhibits 6
 9   and 7, is it your testimony those were bought at a
10   Walmart, and Exhibit 8?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    And same -- is the basis for your belief
13   the same there, that you bought all your cans --
14        A    These are not the same cans as the other
15   one.  These look different.
16        Q    Right.
17        A    Yeah, they're not Blitz cans.
18        Q    Regardless of what type they are, did you
19   buy different cans at different places?
20        A    No.  We only bought that one type.  I've
21   never bought any of these type cans.
22        Q    I'm not sure I'm following what you're
23   saying.  So you're saying you don't know -- you
24   didn't buy any of the --
25        A    I didn't buy any of these.
0121
 1        Q    -- cans in Exhibit 6?
 2        A    No, no.  I didn't buy any of those cans.
 3        Q    Do you know who did?
 4        A    I would say my dad bought them.
 5        Q    And is it fair to say, because you told
 6   me earlier your dad bought all these cans at
 7   Walmart, that he would have bought these cans at
 8   Walmart?
 9        A    I would say so, yes.
10        Q    If we look at the can on the far left in
11   Exhibit 6, there's some writing on there that
12   appears to be "Kerosene" written on the side.  Do
13   you see that?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Do you know whether your dad, in fact,
16   stored kerosene in that can?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Do you know what he used kerosene for in
19   or around his property?
20        A    Different things.  I'm sure he could use
21   it for -- I don't know, I have no idea, but I'm
22   sure he used it for different things.
23        Q    How about in Exhibit 7, we see the can
24   labeled "Diesel."  Do you know whether your dad
25   stored diesel fuel in that can?
0122
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And do you know what he used diesel for?
 3        A    Not really.  I'm sure different things.
 4        Q    Did you ever know your dad to store
 5   anything in the kerosene can other than kerosene?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did you ever know him to store anything
 8   in the diesel can other than diesel fuel?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    And then the other cans here that don't
11   have a particular label on them, do you know what
12   he kept in any of those cans?
13        A    I don't know what he kept in those, no.
14        Q    In terms of the can that you believe he
15   was using at the time of his accident, do you know
16   what type of fuel was actually in the can that day?
17        A    Gasoline.
18        Q    And how do you know that?
19        A    He put -- whatever was in that can,
20   whatever it was labeled, that's what he put in
21   there.  And I could smell the gas.
22        Q    Do you have any idea how long that gas
23   had been in that particular can?
24        A    No.  I mean, he probably -- I mean, he
25   did a lot of stuff, so I would assume it wasn't
0123
 1   very old.
 2        Q    Do you have any --
 3        A    If that's what your -- if that's what you
 4   mean.
 5        Q    I just was wondering if you knew --
 6        A    Yeah.
 7        Q    -- when he last filled the can.
 8        A    I mean, I'm sure he was replenishing all
 9   the time.  I mean, you got lawn mowers, you got
10   golf -- gas golf carts.  There's a lot of -- so I
11   wouldn't know how long.
12        Q    Do you have any knowledge of how much gas
13   was in the can on the morning of your dad's
14   accident?
15        A    No.
16        Q    As we look at Exhibit 6, the can to the
17   far left that's labeled "Kerosene," you see a
18   spout --
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    -- on the top of that can?
21             Do you know whether that is the spout
22   that came with that can?
23        A    I don't know.
24        Q    And then same thing, the can kind of in
25   the middle here, third from the left, also has a
0124
 1   spout.  Do you know whether that's the spout that
 2   came with that can?
 3        A    No, I do not.
 4        Q    The can that's in Exhibit 3 that you
 5   believe is the one your dad was using that
 6   morning -- I'm sorry.  It's not Exhibit 3, it's
 7   Exhibit 5, Exhibit 5.  Do you know whether it had a
 8   spout with it?
 9        A    I see a spout there, but --
10             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
11             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.
12   BY MR. WRAY:
13        Q    You see a spout in Exhibit 5?
14        A    Uh-huh.
15        Q    Is that yes?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Do you know whether that spout was the
18   spout original to that can?
19        A    I couldn't tell you, no.
20        Q    Do you know whether your dad ever
21   interchanged or used any of the different spouts
22   with the number of different cans he had on his
23   yard?
24        A    No.
25        Q    As we look at Exhibit 6, this third can
0125
 1   here in the middle, does it look to you that
 2   there's some type of puncture or hole in the back
 3   of that can near the handle?
 4        A    I'm not sure if that is a -- it was
 5   already -- if that was supposed to be there.  I
 6   mean, it looks like a hole, yes.
 7        Q    Do you know who placed that there?
 8        A    The manufacturer.
 9        Q    I mean, do you have any personal
10   knowledge --
11        A    I mean, I just --
12        Q    -- or are you just guessing?
13        A    Most cans, don't they have these things
14   on the back?  I'm not sure.
15        Q    Yeah.  If you don't know, that's fine.
16   I'm just asking --
17        A    Yeah, I don't know.  No, I don't know.
18        Q    Do you know who put that puncture hole in
19   the back of that can?
20        A    No, I don't know.
21        Q    And if you don't know, that's fine.
22             And do you know why someone would have
23   put a puncture hole in a gas can?
24        A    No.
25        Q    Do you know whether there had been any
0126
 1   similar punctures or marks made on the can shown in
 2   Exhibit 5 that you believe your dad was using the
 3   morning of his accident?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    Did you ever look at it to see if you
 6   could tell that?
 7        A    No.  I was trusting the experts.
 8                  (Defendant's Exhibit 11,
 9             Interrogatories, were marked for
10             identification.)
11                  (Defendant's Exhibit 12,
12             Verification, was marked for
13             identification.)
14   BY MR. WRAY:
15        Q    Ms. West, I've handed you what we've
16   marked as Exhibits 11 and 12, and I'm going to ask
17   you about this a little bit.
18             The first document, Exhibit 11, is what
19   we call interrogatories.  Those are some written
20   questions that I served on your lawyers, and
21   they're required by our court rules to provide me
22   with information in response to it.
23             Did you assist in providing information
24   to answer those questions?
25        A    Yes.
0127
 1        Q    And then I marked as Exhibit 12 a
 2   verification that you signed maybe this morning.
 3   Is that your signature on there?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    And I see it's not notarized yet,
 6   although we can perhaps get it notarized, but let
 7   me ask you this:  Do you swear, under penalty of
 8   perjury, that the information given in your
 9   interrogatory answers was true and correct, to the
10   best of your knowledge?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Have you had a chance to look through
13   those at all today before your deposition?
14        A    No, and I really haven't had time to even
15   look at them in detail, but no.
16        Q    Let me ask you first to take a look on
17   Page 3.  Question 4 asks you to describe in detail
18   the purchase of the gasoline container at issue and
19   then to give certain information about that can,
20   including the retail store where it was purchased,
21   et cetera.  Do you see that?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    And your answer to that question was:
24   Plaintiff believes decedent purchased the gas can
25   at Walmart located in Hilton Head sometime near the
0128
 1   date of manufacture.  Do you see that?  Did I read
 2   that correctly?
 3        A    Yes, yes.
 4        Q    Is that your best belief as to who
 5   purchased the gas can?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    And your best information as to where it
 8   was purchased?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Then you went on to say, or the answer
11   says that:  She is unsure of the method of purchase
12   and believes possibly it could have been a cash
13   purchase.  Do you see that?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Is that your best information and belief?
16        A    Yes, yes.
17        Q    We also asked a question at Number 5 that
18   said:  Identify the person who possesses the
19   greatest knowledge about the purchase of the
20   gasoline container you allege caused the accident,
21   and include in your answer the basis for that
22   person's knowledge about the purchase.  Do you see
23   that question?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    And your answer under oath was:
0129
 1   Decedent's habit and custom as known by his
 2   daughters was to make purchases at the Walmart
 3   located in Hilton Head, South Carolina, and it was
 4   the only available option during the time the can
 5   would have been purchased.  Do you see that?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Is that still today your answer under
 8   oath as to why you believe your dad purchased this
 9   can at a Walmart?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Other than the information set forth in
12   response to Interrogatory 5, do you have any other
13   information or evidence that would shed light on
14   the question of where your dad might have purchased
15   the gas can?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Based upon that answer, am I correct in
18   assuming that the basis for your belief is that you
19   believe your dad bought it at Walmart because
20   that's where you believe he bought those type
21   items?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    You were not with him when he bought it?
24             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
25             THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  No, I
0130
 1        wouldn't say I -- we were together when the
 2        can was bought.  I couldn't tell you, no.
 3   BY MR. WRAY:
 4        Q    And likewise, you weren't with him when
 5   he bought any of these other cans that we saw in
 6   the other exhibits we've looked at today?
 7        A    No.
 8             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 9   BY MR. WRAY:
10        Q    But your best information and belief is
11   that all of those cans, like the subject can, was
12   bought at a Walmart?
13             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
14   BY MR. WRAY:
15        Q    Is that right?
16        A    Yes.
17             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
18   BY MR. WRAY:
19        Q    What effort, if any, have you made,
20   Ms. West, to determine whether there were any other
21   stores in the Bluffton area that might have sold
22   this same type of gas can at the time that you
23   believe your dad purchased the can in question?
24        A    I've left that up to counsel and experts.
25        Q    And again, I don't want to know anything
0131
 1   that you've talked with your counsel or anything
 2   they've said to you, but personally, have you made
 3   any effort yourself to determine whether any other
 4   stores in the Bluffton/Hilton Head area sold
 5   that -- the type of can you believe was involved in
 6   your dad's accident --
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    -- at the time of that -- of his
 9   purchase?
10        A    No.
11        Q    After you were contacted by Tabor four or
12   five days after this accident and you got counsel
13   involved, did you personally do any further
14   investigation yourself to try to determine what
15   happened to your dad?
16        A    I did ask for a FOIA request from
17   Beaufort County, and I did contact the fire
18   department for reports.
19        Q    Did you talk to any witnesses to try to
20   get any further information about what might have
21   happened with your father?
22        A    No, and to this day, I still have not
23   talked to them about it.
24        Q    Did you ever take any photographs or
25   video on or about the date of your dad's accident
0132
 1   to document what the scene looked like at that
 2   time?
 3        A    No, no.
 4        Q    One of the things we also asked your
 5   lawyers for was any type of documentation, whether
 6   it be text, email, Facebook post, et cetera, that
 7   might relate to your dad's accident.  Do you recall
 8   getting that request?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    And have you searched all of your
11   information, whether it be social media, email,
12   text, et cetera, to try to locate anything that
13   might relate to this accident?
14        A    Yes.
15                  (Defendant's Exhibit 13, Email, was
16             marked for identification.)
17   BY MR. WRAY:
18        Q    I'm going to show you what we marked as
19   Exhibit 13, and I will tell you that Mr. Thomas
20   handed me this this morning just before your
21   deposition.  Is this the only communication that
22   you're aware of that relates to your dad's
23   accident?
24        A    This is to Chief Thompson for the fire
25   department asking for a report.  I also -- I recall
0133
 1   emailing Beaufort County, but that was through my
 2   father's email, which I have no access to at this
 3   point.  So once the discovery came, I couldn't
 4   get in -- I couldn't get into those records.
 5   They're gone.  I don't know if they're gone or -- I
 6   tried to get them through Google, but they wouldn't
 7   release them to me.
 8        Q    So John Thompson, the person on
 9   Exhibit 13, that's someone with the Beaufort Fire
10   Department?
11        A    That's with Bluffton Township.
12        Q    But to the best of your knowledge, other
13   than this email, you don't have any other written
14   communications --
15        A    I don't have a document, no, but I'm
16   honestly telling you that I had emails, but I did
17   them through my dad's email, and then I got locked
18   out, and that's all she wrote, after a couple --
19   that was probably a couple months ago.  I couldn't
20   get back in, so --
21        Q    That was an example where I didn't quite
22   finish my question, because I knew you knew where I
23   was going, but to make sure we get the question and
24   answer right --
25        A    I told you I was ADD.
0134
 1        Q    Is Exhibit 13 the only document that you
 2   know of in your possession that relates to any
 3   communications you've had about your dad's
 4   accident?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    You did send some emails from, what I
 7   understood you just said, through your dad's email
 8   account, but you don't have access to those?
 9        A    Correct.
10        Q    Earlier today I asked you some questions
11   about your dad's financial records --
12             MR. THOMAS:  Ron, before you move on --
13             MR. WRAY:  Yeah.
14             MR. THOMAS:  Just -- I don't mean to
15        interrupt you, but to help you as follow-up,
16        she also mentioned that there was a Facebook
17        message that she sent her friend.
18             MR. WRAY:  Yeah, I'm coming back to that,
19        yeah.
20             MR. THOMAS:  Yeah.  And she's -- we've
21        looked, but can't find.  But that's -- I
22        didn't want you to miss that, so --
23             MR. WRAY:  Right.  I appreciate that.
24   BY MR. WRAY:
25        Q    Earlier today you told me that your dad
0135
 1   had some financial records, and I think you said
 2   you still have the bank statements.  Is that right?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Where do you have possession of any of
 5   the paperwork or business records relating to your
 6   dad's business and financial dealings?
 7        A    Some are at my office, and some are at my
 8   home.
 9        Q    Do those records, to the best of your
10   knowledge, include his tax returns?
11        A    From what I understand, he didn't file
12   any returns.  I mean, he's -- he filed a return in
13   2016, which is still in process.  But I filed
14   extensions.  I have not done taxes or anything.
15   That's why if you ask me about what he made, I
16   can't tell you at this point, because I'm extremely
17   busy, and those kind of things I'm going to do at
18   the last minute when I'm called upon to do them,
19   but none of those things have been consolidated to
20   know exactly what he made.
21        Q    Now, I understand that the 8 Myrtle
22   Island Road home was recently sold.  Is that
23   correct?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    When did it sell?
0136
 1        A    I think we closed last week.
 2        Q    Sometime around August 22nd, -3rd?
 3        A    Here, I'll tell you.  See if I can
 4   remember.  It could have been two weeks.  Let me
 5   look at my calendar.  I think it's been two weeks.
 6   Let's say -- I take that back.  I think it closed
 7   August 21st.  I'd have to confirm that with the
 8   real estate agent.
 9        Q    Were you responsible for the sale as the
10   personal representative of your dad's estate?
11        A    That's correct.
12        Q    Earlier we looked at Exhibits 6 and 7,
13   which showed a variety of gas cans that were on the
14   property at least at the time these photographs
15   were taken, which I understood was not long after
16   your dad's accident.
17        A    Correct.
18        Q    Do you know what happened to the cans
19   that we see in Exhibit 6 and 7?
20        A    Yes.  I told my husband to dispose of
21   them.  That would have been probably late
22   March/early April.
23        Q    Why did you ask your husband to dispose
24   of those cans?
25        A    Because they're dangerous.
0137
 1        Q    Is it your understanding that your
 2   husband complied with that request?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    What did he tell you he did with the
 5   cans?
 6        A    He just said he got rid of them.  I don't
 7   know.  He probably -- he could have -- I don't
 8   know.  I don't know where he took them.  But he
 9   wouldn't have put them in a landfill.  He probably
10   disposed of them according to however the county
11   wants you to, you know.
12        Q    Do you know what he did with them, where
13   he took them?
14        A    I would assume he took them to the
15   landfill, but I wouldn't know without asking him.
16        Q    Have you asked him what he did with them?
17        A    No.  He just said he got rid of them,
18   cleaned up the property.
19        Q    Is it your best understanding and belief
20   that if we wanted to see those gas cans today,
21   inspect them, we would be unable to do that?
22        A    That's correct.
23        Q    And is it fair to say the reason we're
24   unable to do that is because you told your husband
25   to get rid of them, and he complied?
0138
 1        A    Yes, yes.
 2        Q    At the time you asked your husband to
 3   dispose of the gas cans, had you already filed a
 4   claim against Walmart?
 5        A    No.  Or I can't recall.  I don't know
 6   when he got rid of the cans and when the thing was
 7   filed.
 8        Q    But you had already spoken --
 9        A    Yeah.
10        Q    -- with counsel, because you told me that
11   earlier, correct?
12        A    Yeah.  We only use metal cans from here
13   on out.
14        Q    Other than whatever investigation may
15   have been done by the Beaufort County Sheriff's
16   Office and any investigation that may have been
17   done by your counsel, do you know of any other
18   person or entity who has investigated your dad's
19   accident?
20        A    No.
21        Q    In any of your discussions with the
22   neighbors around your dad's neighborhood, did any
23   of them indicate to you that they took any pictures
24   or videotape to document the area and what it
25   looked like the day of your dad's accident?
0139
 1        A    No, not to my knowledge.
 2        Q    To the extent that you are aware of any
 3   photographs or video that documents what the area
 4   of your dad's property looked like on the date of
 5   this accident, have you provided all of that
 6   information to your lawyers?
 7        A    Yes.
 8                  (Defendant's Exhibit 14, Documents
 9             from Sheriff's Office, were marked for
10             identification.)
11   BY MR. WRAY:
12        Q    Ms. West, I'm going to show you what's
13   marked as Exhibit 14.  This is a multipage document
14   that we got from the Beaufort County Sheriff's
15   Office, perhaps through your lawyers, and it
16   includes various write-ups about the investigation
17   done by that office.
18             I want to ask you first, if you would,
19   flip over to Page 6 of the report, and this is a
20   summary of an interview that one of the officers
21   did with Gayla Howell West.  Have you ever looked
22   at this document before or seen it?
23        A    No, not until Brady sent it to me
24   yesterday, but I haven't looked at it in detail.
25        Q    So you did actually look at some
0140
 1   documents yesterday?
 2        A    It came through -- I think it was emailed
 3   to me late yesterday, but I haven't looked at it
 4   looked at it, no.
 5        Q    Maybe my question wasn't real good
 6   earlier today.  I thought I asked you what you did
 7   to prepare for the deposition and whether you
 8   looked at any documents.  I thought you told me no,
 9   but --
10        A    I'm sorry.  Yeah.  No.  I received this,
11   but I've not looked at it yet.
12        Q    So you did at least look at the police
13   report.  Did you look at anything else?
14        A    I've never seen any of this information
15   until now, and I know it came through on email, but
16   I haven't looked at it.
17        Q    I want to ask you to look down at the
18   bottom of Page 6, and there's a paragraph that
19   begins, it says:  She said Randy was not a smoker.
20   Do you see that?
21        A    Where is that?  Wait a minute.  I can't
22   see.
23        Q    On Page 6 of 17.
24        A    Okay.
25        Q    Down at the bottom.
0141
 1        A    Okay.  Yeah.
 2        Q    There's a paragraph -- and this is
 3   talking about an interview with Gayla, so this
 4   would be Gayla talking.  She said Randy was not a
 5   smoker.  Is that true?
 6        A    Yes, that's true.
 7        Q    So he did not regularly carry a cigarette
 8   lighter.  He normally lit the burn pile with a
 9   lighter with a long handle, similar to the type
10   people use to light grills.  Do you see that?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Do you recall your dad using a lighter
13   like that, with a long handle, to light the burn
14   pile?
15        A    I know he had one.  I don't think I've
16   ever seen him actually light it, use the lighter
17   itself, and I know there was a lighter on the
18   porch.
19        Q    So I'm going to show you Exhibit 4 that
20   we marked yesterday, and do you see a green-handled
21   lighter in that picture?
22        A    Yes, yes.
23        Q    Do you recall that lighter being on the
24   property when you went out in the backyard the day
25   or two after this accident?
0142
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Was that where the lighter was located,
 3   or was it somewhere else?
 4        A    That's where it was, yes.
 5        Q    Did you take possession of it?
 6        A    No, I did not.
 7        Q    And if we keep reading down on Page 6, it
 8   says:  I asked West -- this is Gayla West -- where
 9   the lighter and gas can were now.  She believed
10   they were in the possession of her stepdaughter
11   Shellie West.  Is that correct?
12        A    No, that's incorrect.  No, it is not.
13        Q    You told me Mr. Tabor and your neighbor
14   took possession of the gas can initially?
15        A    Right.
16        Q    And then they delivered it to you at some
17   point?
18        A    No.  It was never delivered to me.
19        Q    It went from them to the investigator out
20   of Charleston?
21        A    That's true.
22        Q    And then how about the lighter?  So
23   you're saying you never took possession of the
24   lighter?
25        A    No.
0143
 1        Q    Do you know where that lighter is now?
 2        A    No, I do not.
 3        Q    Then the next sentence says:  She,
 4   meaning Gayla, said Shellie was not fond of her.
 5   Is that a true statement?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Do you know any reason why Gayla would
 8   have that impression or tell the sheriff's office
 9   that?
10        A    Probably just being -- I mean, I don't
11   know.  I mean, I don't know why she would say that
12   unless she's -- just because of the litigation
13   we're in currently with the estate.
14        Q    Then it said:  Shellie confronted her
15   after she found out that West was to marry Randy.
16   Shellie sat down with her and told her she was
17   going to sign a prenup and get a job.  Shellie told
18   her that she was not going to get anything that
19   Shellie had worked so hard for.  Is any of that
20   true?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Did that conversation ever take place?
23        A    We had a conversation with her and my
24   father about their intentions and their plans, but
25   no, I never told her to get a job or tell my dad to
0144
 1   sign a prenup, or her.
 2        Q    If we flip over to Page 9 -- are you at
 3   Page 9 yet?  And I'm going to -- and you might need
 4   to look at Page 8 first just to confirm.  This is a
 5   summary of an interview that the sheriff's office
 6   had with your neighbor, Tom Vezzosi.  Do you know
 7   Tom?
 8        A    No.  I think I saw him maybe briefly, I
 9   don't know when, but no, I don't know him.
10        Q    And now let me ask you to push -- go over
11   to Page 9, and at the top of the page, it says:  I
12   asked Vezzosi if the man said, quote, I grabbed the
13   wrong can, close quote.  Do you see that?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Have you ever heard anybody comment or
16   state that your dad made some statement similar to,
17   "I grabbed the wrong can"?
18        A    No, no one's told me that.
19        Q    Have you ever heard that that has somehow
20   come up in any of the discussions with the
21   sheriff's office or any of the witnesses who might
22   have been on scene the day of your dad's accident?
23        A    No, because I have gotten zero
24   information about the accident.
25        Q    Do you have any idea what anyone who
0145
 1   might have made that statement would have been
 2   referencing when they say that your dad made some
 3   statement like, "I grabbed the wrong can"?
 4        A    Well, I mean, the diesel can was sitting
 5   there.  I can only make an assumption, but I don't
 6   know.
 7        Q    And if you flip over to Page 11, and this
 8   actually references some communications with you,
 9   and the first sentence says:  On 11/30/18, I
10   received a Facebook Messenger message from Shellie
11   West requesting a phone call.  Do you see that?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    And Mr. Thomas mentioned earlier that
14   there was, in fact, some Facebook Messenger
15   exchanges between you and folks at the sheriff's
16   office.  Is that right?
17        A    With Angela Viens, but it wasn't through
18   the sheriff's office.
19        Q    Okay.  It was through Facebook Messenger?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Right.  Did you keep or preserve -- and I
22   don't do Facebook, so I don't know.  Do those
23   messages -- are they saved?
24        A    Not if they're too personal, because it's
25   all filtered in with the chamber, and people have
0146
 1   access to my -- I don't want anybody knowing my
 2   personal business, so if it's too personal, no, I
 3   would not have kept it.
 4        Q    It goes on to say -- this is a report
 5   prepared by the sheriff's office.  It said:  I
 6   spoke with her via telephone at that time, and she
 7   expressed concern over the lack of report or
 8   investigation into her father's death.  Is that
 9   true?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Why were you concerned about the lack of
12   report or investigation into your father's death?
13        A    Because there was zero.  At the time,
14   there was zero.  We didn't have any information.
15   We didn't know what happened.  And I did not want
16   to talk to witnesses because it was too emotional.
17   I just wanted the reports.
18        Q    The next sentence then says:  She also
19   expressed some concern over her father's current
20   wife and rumor that she may have been associated
21   with other fire-related deaths (in her past, prior
22   to meeting Mr. West) and inconsistent stories
23   provided to family members (by Gayla West) over the
24   events surrounding her father's death.  Did I read
25   that accurate?
0147
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Is that a true statement?
 3        A    Yeah, there was some questions there, but
 4   that's because there was no information.
 5        Q    Did you tell the sheriff's office that
 6   you were concerned about the fact that Gayla had
 7   been associated with other fire-related deaths?
 8        A    I don't recall that statement.  I know I
 9   had a conversation with Angela.  I just wanted to
10   get confirmation on witness statements.  I could
11   have said that, I don't know, but I don't recall
12   the total conversation.
13        Q    Did you, in fact, have some concern about
14   the fact that Gayla had some association or
15   relationship with some prior fire incident?
16        A    There was -- yeah.  There was a little
17   speculation there that was concerning, yes.  I'm
18   not going to lie.
19        Q    Who was speculating about that?
20        A    Well, my cousin Cliff.
21        Q    I thought you told me earlier you really
22   didn't talk with Cliff about what he --
23        A    Well, I didn't talk to him.  He prompted
24   my aunt.  My aunt was the one with all -- with the
25   main concerns about it.
0148
 1        Q    Is it true that you had some concerns
 2   about inconsistent stories provided to family
 3   members by Gayla about the events surrounding your
 4   father's death?
 5             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 6             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, but it was the day of
 7        the accident, and we didn't get any -- I'm
 8        sure she was traumatized, so we just kind of
 9        let it go at that.
10   BY MR. WRAY:
11        Q    What type of stories did you hear or get
12   from Gayla that you thought were inconsistent about
13   what happened to your dad?
14             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
15             THE WITNESS:  She told one of us that --
16        she told somebody that she was in the -- I
17        think she told Leigh she was in the house, I
18        think she told me she heard an explosion, but
19        she told my husband that she was on the back
20        porch, so I think she was just traumatized,
21        because that was probably -- that was exactly
22        right after.
23   BY MR. WRAY:
24        Q    When you say it was exactly right after,
25   you're talking about the day --
0149
 1        A    The accident, yeah.
 2        Q    -- of the event or the next day?
 3        A    Yeah, but we didn't -- we've had no
 4   discussion with her at all about the accident
 5   after.  Didn't seem necessary.
 6        Q    If we look down to the fourth paragraph,
 7   it then says:  On February 28th, I again received a
 8   Facebook Messenger message from Shellie West
 9   inquiring about the investigator's name and
10   inquiring as to why no statements were taken from
11   any witnesses.  Is that true?
12        A    Yeah.  I asked for a follow-up on the
13   incident, like exactly whatever's in here, I guess.
14        Q    So it says -- so it seems from this that
15   you at least sent two Facebook Messenger messages,
16   one on November 30th, 2018, and one on
17   February 28th, 2019.  Did you send any other
18   Facebook Messenger requests to this officer?
19        A    I don't think so, no.
20        Q    Did you have any other written
21   communications with anybody else at the sheriff's
22   office?
23        A    No, other than the FOIA request.
24        Q    Then the officer says:  On April 24th,
25   2019, I had a telephone conversation with someone
0150
 1   who identified herself as Barbara West Judson.
 2             That's your aunt, correct?
 3        A    Yes, correct.
 4        Q    Were you present or did you participate
 5   in that phone call?
 6        A    I did not.
 7        Q    He says:  Ms. Judson indicated that her
 8   family has a lot of unsettled questions regarding
 9   Mr. West's death.  Do you see that?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    Is that a true statement?
12        A    I would say so, yes.
13        Q    What type of questions did you feel were
14   unsettled relating to your father's death?
15        A    I'd say just not knowing that there was
16   no investigation or no securing of the scene
17   because somebody died, no reports.  I mean, we
18   didn't think Beaufort County did their due
19   diligence to secure it and to take statements at
20   the time.
21        Q    As we keep on reading, it says:  She
22   stated there was a gas can sitting under the shed,
23   and there was also a fire extinguisher there.  Do
24   you see that?
25        A    Yes.
0151
 1        Q    Did you -- the gas can under the shed,
 2   was that the diesel can that you told me earlier
 3   you saw?
 4        A    I assume that's what she's talking about,
 5   yeah.
 6        Q    Did you see a fire extinguisher on the
 7   property?
 8        A    Not 'til later, but yeah, he -- yeah,
 9   there was a fire extinguisher.  There was actually
10   several, I guess, on the property.
11        Q    Did you see any evidence that the fire
12   extinguisher was used or attempted to be used on
13   the date of your dad's accident?
14        A    No.
15        Q    And then the next sentence says:  She
16   stated that there have been several different
17   stories told about the incident.
18             Anything more you'd add to that from what
19   you said earlier?
20        A    No.
21             MR. WRAY:  Let's stop because he says
22        we're running out of tape, but we can keep
23        going unless y'all --
24             MR. THOMAS:  I need to use the bathroom,
25        actually.
0152
 1             MR. WRAY:  Okay.
 2             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the end of
 3        Media Number 2 in the deposition of Shellie
 4        West.  We are off the record at 12:04 p.m.
 5                  (A recess transpired.)
 6             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the beginning
 7        of Media Number 3 in the deposition of Shellie
 8        West.  We are on the record at 12:11 p.m.
 9   BY MR. WRAY:
10        Q    Ms. West, we're back on the record.  We
11   were looking at Page 11 of Exhibit 14, and where we
12   left off, the next sentence in this report says --
13        A    I'm sorry.  What page are we on?
14        Q    Page 11 of 17.  And I was going through
15   the section where your Aunt Barbara spoke with the
16   sheriff's office.  We talked about the fire
17   extinguisher, and then right after that, it says:
18   She also said that there is a firearm missing from
19   Mr. West's home.  Do you see that?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Was there any significance of that to
22   you?
23        A    No, other than the fact that we couldn't
24   find it.
25        Q    Did you believe someone had taken the gun
0153
 1   or that it had some relationship at all to your
 2   dad's accident?
 3        A    No.  You know, he kept it in his vehicle,
 4   and it was unlocked, and we didn't get to search
 5   for it 'til much later, so someone could have --
 6   there's just no telling.  But he did carry it in
 7   the car, and he didn't lock the car.
 8        Q    Then it says:  She is reluctant to make
 9   an accusation against anyone; however, there is
10   some concern over some things leading up to the
11   event, including a conversation between Mr. West's
12   current wife (via text) and the pastor that married
13   them regarding survivorship issues.  Do you see
14   that?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Do you remember there being concern over
17   things leading up to the accident?
18             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
19             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I don't know where
20        her thoughts are there.
21   BY MR. WRAY:
22        Q    Do you recall any conversation between
23   Gayla and maybe your aunt about survivorship
24   issues?
25        A    No.
0154
 1        Q    We skip down to the next paragraph.  It
 2   says:  Ironically, after speaking with Ms. West
 3   Judson, I received a call from Clifton Vaughan, who
 4   is Mr. West's nephew.  Mr. Vaughan explained that
 5   he is experienced in public safety and came to
 6   Bluffton two days after the fire.
 7             Were you present for Mr. Vaughan's
 8   discussion with anybody at the sheriff's office?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Did he share with you any of that
11   discussion?
12        A    No, he did not.
13        Q    Then it says:  He, meaning Mr. Vaughan,
14   was adamant that he knows that Mr. West would never
15   douse a fire with gasoline when the diesel can was
16   only seven feet away from the fire by a post.  Do
17   you see that?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    Did Mr. Vaughan ever express that belief
20   to you?
21        A    No.
22        Q    Do you agree with Mr. Vaughan's
23   assessment that your dad would never douse a fire
24   with gasoline?
25        A    He was not accustomed to doing that.  I
0155
 1   mean, he wouldn't have lit a fire.  I wouldn't say
 2   he wouldn't put it on there, but I don't know.
 3        Q    Had you ever seen your dad put gas on a
 4   fire prior -- at any time prior to his accident?
 5        A    Not to my knowledge, no.
 6        Q    Do you remember ever discussing that with
 7   him, about whether he would use gas or diesel to
 8   put on a fire?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Then Mr. Vaughan apparently went on to
11   say:  The burn pattern on a palm tree indicated to
12   him that the fire burned from the ground up.  He
13   indicated that the yard had been cleaned up quite a
14   bit since the fire.  He actually saw Mr. West's
15   burned clothing on the ground.  Do you see that?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Did you ever talk with your cousin about
18   his feelings or belief about the burn pattern?
19        A    No.  This is the first time I'm seeing
20   this.
21        Q    And then if we flip to Page 12, the
22   conclusion of that paragraph says:  Although there
23   was no direct accusation against Mr. West's current
24   wife of having been involved in this fire, the
25   topic was circled.  Do you see that?
0156
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Do you recall ever having any discussions
 3   with anybody at the sheriff's office or fire
 4   department indicating a belief by you or anyone in
 5   your family that perhaps Gayla had something to do
 6   with your dad's accident?
 7             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 8             THE WITNESS:  No.  I was called in.  I
 9        can't remember the guy's name on Hilton Head,
10        asked me to come in after I spoke with Angela,
11        and I thought he was just going to give me
12        information, but I said I didn't have any kind
13        of statement, I just wanted witness
14        statements, and left.  So I never made a --
15        that's the only other contact I've had.
16   BY MR. WRAY:
17        Q    Have you ever made any accusation,
18   whether formally or informally, meaning in a
19   lawsuit or just informally in conversation with
20   friends and neighbors, in which you expressed a
21   belief that Gayla had anything to do with your
22   dad's death?
23        A    No.
24             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
25             THE WITNESS:  No.
0157
 1   BY MR. WRAY:
 2        Q    After the accident, when the gas can that
 3   you believe was involved in the accident was picked
 4   up by Carlus and Tabor, do you know where they
 5   actually stored it until the investigator came to
 6   get it?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Do you know whether it was in a
 9   climate-controlled area, or was it indoors?
10   Outdoors?  Do you know any of those details?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Is it your belief it was in that black
13   plastic bag we see in the photograph?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    And you think it was somewhere over at
16   Carlus's house?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    But you don't know where specifically or
19   how long it was kept there?
20        A    No.
21        Q    What exactly is it that you do for the
22   chamber?
23        A    I am the CEO, and I'm the founder.
24        Q    What does -- a CEO, that means that you
25   run all aspects?
0158
 1        A    Chief executive officer, yes.
 2        Q    And did your dad help you set up the
 3   chamber business?
 4        A    No.  We're in the building that he is in
 5   partnership with in Trident, LLC.  He didn't help
 6   me set it up, but, you know, he helped us with the
 7   building and the maintenance of the building.
 8        Q    In answer to some of the questions we
 9   served in this case, the interrogatories we looked
10   at earlier, there was an indication that you
11   received some financial support from your dad.  Is
12   that true?
13        A    No, not unless I needed something, if it
14   was like an emergency situation, but no, he did not
15   supplement my income.
16        Q    Do you know of anyone who was financially
17   dependent on your dad other than Gayla?
18        A    No.
19        Q    How often did you actually see your dad
20   in the --
21        A    When you say financial, do you mean like
22   his -- people that he did business with or anything
23   like that?
24        Q    No, no.  I'm talking about friends/family
25   members --
0159
 1        A    Okay.
 2        Q    -- that he was providing financial
 3   support --
 4        A    Okay.
 5        Q    -- to help them get by.
 6        A    Okay.
 7        Q    Do you understand that question?
 8        A    Yeah.  It's just -- as far as I know, it
 9   was just -- Gayla was the only one he was
10   supporting.  I think he was also -- they were
11   giving a friend money, Beverly, to help her out.
12   That's all I know.
13        Q    But not you, not Leigh, not any of --
14        A    No.  I mean, you know, he might give us a
15   love gift at the end of the year for tax write-off
16   or something like that, but no.  I mean, my husband
17   makes good money.  I don't need --
18        Q    During the -- let's say the last five
19   years of your dad's life, how often did you guys
20   spend time together?
21        A    Close to every other day, probably.
22        Q    And what type of things did you like to
23   do?  You mentioned fishing earlier.
24        A    I mean, just, you know, hanging out.
25   Sometimes we grilled out together or he came -- you
0160
 1   know, whatever it was, hanging out at the water.
 2   We have a dock down at the water.
 3        Q    Did you consider your dad and you to have
 4   a really close relationship?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    And same with Leigh?  Was he close with
 7   her as well?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Did they see each other about as often as
10   you did, or was it more frequent or less frequent?
11        A    No.  Leigh -- Leigh's schedule wouldn't
12   allow that, and dad used to come by and have coffee
13   with me, so yeah, I saw him a lot more.
14        Q    One of the things that's involved in any
15   lawsuit that gets filed is a question of damages
16   that someone is seeking, and I want to ask you a
17   little bit about that.
18             Did you have funeral expenses associated
19   with your dad's death?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    Do you know what those costs were?
22        A    Less than $4,000.  It was
23   three-something.  I don't remember the exact
24   figure.
25        Q    Did you pay for that?
0161
 1        A    I paid for it out of the estate account.
 2        Q    I understand there were some medical
 3   bills from Augusta burn center related to your
 4   dad's care and treatment there?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Do you know what those amounts were?
 7        A    I know one bill was for over $17,000, and
 8   there's some residual, but I haven't added them up.
 9        Q    And we got some information from your
10   lawyers.  We can -- we can get that from them.  I
11   just was curious.  Do you know what the amount was?
12        A    Not the total amount, no.
13        Q    Are there any other out-of-pocket
14   expenses that the estate has incurred related to
15   your dad's death?
16        A    Like what?
17        Q    Well, I mentioned like funeral expenses,
18   medical bills, costs out of pocket, things that you
19   had to pay for or buy that you relate -- I'm not
20   talking about your lawyers.  They're dealt
21   separately.
22        A    Well, other than just paying -- keeping
23   the mortgage payments up and insurance for the
24   houses and whatever all that is, just to keep
25   paying electrical bills and whatever, phone bill,
0162
 1   whatever it was, the ongoing expenses.
 2        Q    Since your dad's death, have you
 3   personally undergone any counseling to help you
 4   deal with any of the issues/grief/sorrow related to
 5   his death?
 6        A    I've gone to a couple of sessions, but
 7   plan to go back in.
 8        Q    Who have you seen?
 9        A    It's a -- her name's Mandy.  I can't
10   remember the last name.  She has a counseling
11   company called Trinity Counseling.  But she's
12   seeing my children right now, so mama goes last.
13   Mama's always last.
14        Q    And how about Leigh?  Do you know if
15   she's undergone any counseling or sought any
16   help --
17        A    No.
18        Q    -- to deal with any of the issues related
19   to your dad's death?
20        A    No.
21        Q    How would you describe the impact of this
22   incident on you and your family?
23        A    Horrific.
24        Q    Are you and your sister close?
25        A    Yes.
0163
 1        Q    Have you remained close since the
 2   accident?
 3        A    Yeah.  We don't see each other on a
 4   regular basis, though.  You know, we contact each
 5   other when we need to.  We're just both very busy
 6   people.  She has her turtles, I have my kids.
 7        Q    And I understand from your testimony
 8   earlier today and from Gayla yesterday that there
 9   has been some impact on the relationship between
10   your family and Gayla.  Is that fair to say?
11        A    I'd say it's all, you know, attorney and
12   legalese stuff, you know.  We were fine until that
13   point.
14        Q    And that's what I wanted to ask you.  Is
15   most of the impact on that relationship due to the
16   estate litigation as opposed to the incident
17   involving your dad?
18             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
19             THE WITNESS:  I don't understand the
20        question.
21   BY MR. WRAY:
22        Q    Well, I thought I understood you to say
23   that up until the lawsuit was filed, you and your
24   sister and Gayla actually got along fairly well?
25        A    Yes, that's correct.
0164
 1        Q    And then at that point in time when
 2   litigation was filed, y'all are no longer close?
 3        A    Yeah.  I'd say that's accurate, I guess,
 4   yeah.  We just don't talk outside of the
 5   litigation, on counsel advice, I guess.
 6        Q    I know I've asked you a lot of questions
 7   today, and I appreciate your patience, but it's so
 8   important that we understand everything, and this
 9   is my only chance to ask you questions --
10        A    I know.
11        Q    -- so I want to ask you kind of a broad,
12   open-ended question.
13             Is there any other information that
14   relates to your dad's accident, what happened to
15   him, and how he was injured, that you have not yet
16   shared with me today?
17             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
18             THE WITNESS:  No, because I haven't
19        gotten any.  I mean, this is -- this is what I
20        wanted from the beginning was just the
21        statements.  But no, I don't have any
22        knowledge of what even happened.
23   BY MR. WRAY:
24        Q    You mentioned that one of the reasons you
25   contacted the sheriff's office back in November and
0165
 1   then followed up in I think it was April was
 2   because you had a lot of unanswered questions.  Is
 3   that fair to say?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    And that was true at the time you
 6   contacted the sheriff's office?
 7        A    Yes.
 8        Q    Does it remain true today, since you
 9   still don't have a lot of answers?
10        A    No.  I think, you know, this seems to be
11   what we were looking for from the beginning.  I
12   just wish they had done their due diligence and not
13   put us out so far.
14        Q    Right.  You're talking about from the
15   sheriff's office.  I'm just asking do you have any
16   more details now that give you any certainty as to
17   what happened with your dad than what you had
18   before?
19        A    Not outside what this is, no.
20             Sorry.  That's my lunch appointment that
21   I'm not making.
22             MR. WRAY:  Well, I think I'm pretty much
23        done.  Let's go off the record for a moment.
24        Let me ask my co-counsel here if she's got
25        anything I missed, and we'll come wrap up.

 5        12:28 p.m.
 6   BY MR. WRAY:
 7        Q    Ms. West, just a few more questions to
 8   wrap up.
 9             You told me earlier that perhaps
10   yesterday when Mr. Thomas sent you the sheriff's
11   office report, that was the first time you had seen
12   that report.  Is that correct?
13             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
14             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, but I had not read it
15        yet.
16   BY MR. WRAY:
17        Q    Did you -- or have you read any of the
18   medical records relating to your dad's accident?
19        A    Yeah.  I did get a detailed report from
20   the hospital.  I could not read through it.  It was
21   too horrific.
22        Q    Did you see in any of the records you
23   received from the hospital or otherwise any
24   reference to a claim that your dad was pouring
25   gasoline on the burn pile at the time of his
0167
 1   accident?
 2        A    I don't recall.  I think this was just
 3   a -- it was like an injury report.  I don't know.
 4   I didn't read all the way through it.  It was
 5   too -- I couldn't tell you.
 6        Q    Have you ever seen any report, whether it
 7   be from the hospital, the sheriff's office, or
 8   elsewhere, that indicated your dad was pouring gas
 9   on the burn pile at the time the accident occurred?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Has anybody ever told you that that's
12   what he was doing?
13        A    No.
14        Q    Do you know -- if the medical records
15   indicate that or say that in certain places, do you
16   have any knowledge as to what the source of that
17   information would be?
18        A    No.  The only information I had from the
19   fire department was that Lee Levesque, who did the
20   report that I got through FOIA, said that it was in
21   the report that they knew that he was holding the
22   can because his hand was blown.  That's all I know.
23   I don't know about -- I don't know -- unless there
24   was a witness watching him pour it, no.
25        Q    And you're not aware of any such witness.
0168
 1   Is that fair to say?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    Do you know -- or has anybody indicated
 4   to you that your dad ever communicated what exactly
 5   happened to him?
 6        A    There was in the report from the fire
 7   department that they interviewed the EMT, but he
 8   didn't speak directly to him.
 9        Q    The EMT didn't speak directly to your
10   dad?
11        A    No.  The gentleman that did the report,
12   Lee Levesque from the fire department, interviewed
13   the EMT, and I think he said that he could have --
14   it's in the report that he thought he accidentally
15   picked up something, but the term that was in
16   there, the verbiage, was nothing dad would have
17   ever said, so I think it was a little -- I don't
18   know.
19        Q    Why do you say --
20        A    He interviewed them after the fact.  It
21   was something to the -- whatever he said or
22   whatever they quoted him on, I just thought it was
23   a weird -- didn't make sense to me, but --
24        Q    What specifically is it that you
25   thought --
0169
 1        A    It was probably whatever he poured --
 2   whatever he thought he was pouring on the fire.  I
 3   don't know.  It was like oil or something.  Not
 4   oil.  But he said, "I thought I poured this on it."
 5   I don't know.  But it's in the report.
 6        Q    Do you know of anybody who claims to have
 7   spoken with your dad or communicated with your dad
 8   about what exactly happened to him?
 9        A    I don't think he knew what happened to
10   him.  I think Tom Vezzosi said that he didn't know
11   what happened to him.  He was like, "What happened
12   to me?"
13        Q    That's a little bit different question,
14   and I think I know your answer, but I need to get
15   it on the record.
16        A    Okay.
17        Q    Do you know of anybody who says, "I spoke
18   with Mr. West the day of the accident, and this is
19   what he told me happened to him"?
20        A    No, no.
21        Q    Have you ever had any communication with
22   anybody at Walmart about your dad's accident?
23        A    No.
24        Q    Have you ever attempted to contact
25   anybody at Walmart or tried to speak with them
0170
 1   about your dad's accident?
 2        A    No.
 3        Q    To the extent there's been any
 4   communication with Walmart, has all that been
 5   handled through your lawyers?
 6        A    Yes, through the lawyers.
 7        Q    You'd mentioned that at some point you
 8   sent a FOIA request?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Was that before you retained counsel?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Okay.  So that went through your lawyers?
13        A    I think I did it -- I did it on my own.
14        Q    All right.  Well, that's what I was
15   trying to clarify.  Did you send some type of FOIA
16   request yourself?
17        A    Yeah.  I went -- yes.
18        Q    And whatever documents you got in
19   response to that, did you give those to your
20   lawyers?
21        A    I don't think so, no.  I think they
22   already had their -- I think the information has
23   already been collected.  I just did it on my own.
24             MR. WRAY:  I guess to the extent if she
25        has anything different than what's been
0171
 1        produced --
 2             MR. THOMAS:  Yeah.
 3             THE WITNESS:  I mean, yeah.  I'll produce
 4        it if I go back through it.  I mean, I've
 5        moved three times since my dad died.  I mean,
 6        there's stuff everywhere.  So I'll definitely
 7        produce it if I come across or recall.
 8             MR. THOMAS:  Yeah.  We'll just notate any
 9        time we get anything, I'll immediately send it
10        to you, Ron.
11   BY MR. WRAY:
12        Q    Are there any other details about the
13   incident and accident involving your father that we
14   haven't discussed today --
15             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
16   BY MR. WRAY:
17        Q    -- that you can think of, Ms. West?
18             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
19             THE WITNESS:  I don't think so, no.
20   BY MR. WRAY:
21        Q    Have you answered all of my questions
22   today honestly and truthfully to the best of your
23   ability?
24        A    Yes.
25        Q    Is there anything that you can think of
0172
 1   now as we wrap up that you said earlier today that
 2   you believe you need to amend or correct to make
 3   your testimony truthful?
 4             MR. TINSLEY:  Object to the form.
 5             THE WITNESS:  Huh-uh, not that I can
 6        think of right now.
 7             MR. WRAY:  That's all I have.
 8             THE WITNESS:  What did I say?
 9             MR. WRAY:  That's all I have, gentlemen.
10             MR. TINSLEY:  We don't have any
11        questions.
12             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  This
13        concludes the deposition --
14             THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
15             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  -- of Shellie West.
16        We are off the record at 12:34 p.m.

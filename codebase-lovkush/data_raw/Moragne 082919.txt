        1                  THE COURT REPORTER:  My name is

        2    Terri Valente on behalf of Lexitas.

        3                  (It was stipulated by and among

        4    counsel that the reading, signing, sealing,

        5    certification, and filing be waived; and that all

        6    objections, except as to the form of the question,

       17                 MR. DOBSON:  Sure.

       21    BY MS. EAGER:

       22    Q.       Hi.  My name is Kathleen Eager.  This is a

       23    deposition.  Have you ever been deposed before?

       24    A.       (No response.)





                                                                 5


        1    Q.       Have you ever been in a deposition before?

        2    A.       No.

        3    Q.       This is just my opportunity to ask you

        4    questions regarding this accident.  There's just a

        5    few things to remember about a deposition that are

        6    different than the course of a normal conversation.

        7    Oftentimes in normal conversations we tend to answer

        8    questions by making hand gestures or nodding our

        9    head or saying mm-hmm.  In a deposition we have a

       10    court reporter, so everything you say has to be

       11    audible so she can record it.

       12    A.       Okay.

       13    Q.       Also, during the course of normal

       14    conversation sometimes we tend to anticipate the end

       15    of a question and we start to answer before the

       16    other person is finished.  Once again, because we

       17    have a court reporter, she has to record everything

       18    we say, so we both can't be speaking at once.  So

       19    just try to wait until I'm finished before you

       20    answer the question.

       21    A.       All right.

       22    Q.       The most important thing to remember is to

       23    tell the truth.  If you don't remember something,

       24    simply say "I don't remember."  I don't want you to





                                                                 6


        1    have to guess.

        2    A.       Okay.

        3    Q.       If at any point you need me to repeat a

        4    question, or if I'm speaking too fast, which I

        5    sometimes do, just ask me and we can do so.

        6    A.       Okay.

        7    Q.       I don't anticipate this taking too long.  I

        8    think the setup probably will have taken longer than

        9    this actual deposition, but if at any point you need

       10    to stop and take a break or speak to your attorney,

       11    just let me know and we can do so.

       12    A.       Okay.

       13    Q.       We'll start with something simple.  What's

       14    your name?

       15    A.       Preston Moragne.

       16    Q.       Your date of birth?

       17    A.       7/27/70.

       18    Q.       And your present address?

       19    A.       421 Springton Way.

       20    Q.       Who do you presently reside with?

       21    A.       My wife and children.

       22    Q.       And what is your wife's name?

       23    A.       Nina.  Same last name.

       24    Q.       And how many children reside with you?





                                                                 7


        1    A.       Well, I have one at home and then one at

        7    Q.       So, it's safe to say you lived there at the

        8    time of the accident?

        9    A.       Yes.

       10    Q.       And at the time of the accident were you

       11    living with your wife and children as well?

       12    A.       Yes.

       13    Q.       Why don't you tell me a little bit about

       14    your educational history.

       15    A.       I have a bachelor's degree from

       16    Millersville University.  And I'm a private pilot,

       17    certified private pilot.

       18    Q.       What high school did you graduate from?

       19    A.       Abraham Lincoln High School in

       20    Philadelphia.

       21    Q.       And you said you have a private pilot

       22    certification?  Is that what you said?

       23    A.       Correct.

       24    Q.       Any other schooling or certifications?





                                                                 8


        1    A.       I'm a certified scuba diver.

        2    Q.       Anything else?

        3    A.       That's about it.

        4    Q.       Are you presently employed?

        5    A.       Yes.

        6    Q.       Where at?

        7    A.       Lancaster Early Education Center.

        9    A.       There, about -- going on like three weeks.

       10    Q.       Okay.

       11    A.       Because I volunteer there also, so...

       12    Q.       What are your job duties there?

       13    A.       I do the marketing for them.

       14    Q.       Is that full-time?

                                                                 9


        1    Q.       Where did you work prior to that?

        2    A.       Prior to that, I also own my own company

        3    which I do marketing for.  It's a marketing company.

        4    Q.       What is that company's name?

        5    A.       Karman Line Marketing, with a "K".

       16    correct?

       17                 MR. DOBSON:  Right.

       18    BY MS. EAGER:

       19    Q.       Let's talk about the date of the accident.

       20    Do you remember the date?

       21    A.       The date itself?

       22    Q.       Yes.

       23    A.       I just remember it was in May.

       24    Q.       Would May 10th, 2016 sound correct?





                                                                10


        1    A.       I would say so.

        2    Q.       Do you remember the time?

        3    A.       It was in the afternoon.

        4    Q.       And how about the weather conditions that

        5    day?

        6    A.       Clear.

        7    Q.       How about the roadway?  Was it wet; was it

        8    dry, if you can recall?

        9    A.       Dry.

       10    Q.       Were you the driver of the vehicle?

       11    A.       Yes.

       12    Q.       Did you have any passengers in your

       13    vehicle?

       14    A.       No.

       15    Q.       What kind of vehicle were you driving?

       16    A.       Nissan Altima.  A black Nissan Altima.  I

       17    think it was like a 2015.

       18    Q.       Where were you coming from at the time of

       19    the accident?

       20    A.       I was coming from Lancaster City and I was

       21    headed down Columbia Avenue.

       22    Q.       Where were you headed to?

       23    A.       Home.

       24    Q.       Why don't you just tell me what happened in





                                                                11


        1    the accident?

        2    A.       So, I was on Columbia Avenue and there's a

        3    lot of traffic on that street, and I was stopped

        4    because of the traffic.  Then I just saw a car in my

        5    rearview mirror.  I stopped and I always just check

        6    back to see if anybody else is -- making sure

        7    everybody else is going to stop, and I just noticed

        8    this car, like, coming at a high rate of speed.  And

        9    at that point I was like, Wow, I hope this car slows

       10    down.  And boom, it didn't slow down.  And then I

       11    was rear ended.

       12    Q.       Just some followup questions on that.  So

       13    at the time of impact were you stopped?

       14    A.       Yes.

       15    Q.       And you said you saw the vehicle prior to

       16    impact; correct?

       17    A.       Correct.

       18    Q.       Could you approximate how far the vehicle

       19    was when you first saw it?

       20    A.       When I first saw it, it looked like it was

       21    probably about -- well, the part of that area that I

       22    was in, it could have been maybe about ten cars

       23    back.

       24    Q.       Were you able to approximate the speed of





                                                                12


        1    the vehicle?

        2    A.       It was going faster than anything that I

        3    saw in my rearview mirror before.

        4    Q.       Could you clarify that at all?

        5    A.       No.  I couldn't tell you the speed, but I

        6    can tell you that it was alarming to see someone

        7    coming when I'm stopped and somebody not slowing

        8    down.  It was just...

        9    Q.       Would you say more than 15 miles an hour,

       10    20 miles an hour?

       11    A.       Yeah.  It was probably around like at least

       12    15, 20 miles an hour.

       13    Q.       And you said you saw the vehicle prior to

       14    impact.  Were you able to take any evasive measures

       15    to avoid the impact?

       16    A.       When I looked out of my rearview mirror, I

       17    was, like, wow, this car is going to go, but the car

       18    that was in front of me didn't allow me to -- I

       19    wouldn't have been able to swerve.  So, I didn't get

       20    the opportunity to do anything.

       21    Q.       What part of the other vehicle impacted

       22    your vehicle?

       23    A.       Her front end impacted my car.

       24    Q.       How would you categorize the severity of





                                                                13


        1    the impact?  Would you say it was a light impact,

        2    medium, heavy?

        3    A.       Well, I had to take my car to get it

        4    repaired.  The trunk, the fender, some under --

        5    construction parts, I don't know what you call them,

        6    but that all had to get redone by the body shop.

        7    Q.       How would you actually categorize the

        8    impact as you were in the vehicle?

        9    A.       Oh, my impact?

       10    Q.       The impact, yes.

       11    A.       I would say it was heavy.

       12    Q.       A heavy impact?

       13    A.       Yeah.

       14    Q.       Did your airbags deploy?

       15    A.       No.

       16    Q.       So, upon impact, what happened to your body

       17    inside the vehicle?  Did you move forward, backward,

       18    to the left, to the right?

       19    A.       So, upon impact, I felt two things:  I felt

       20    my abs get stressed out, and I guess that was

       21    because of the seatbelt catching me from the impact.

       22    And then the back of my head, because it felt -- I

       23    know for a fact that I blacked out for like a few

       24    seconds or whatever it was, because I was





                                                                14


        1    disoriented.  So, I didn't know if I hit my head on

        2    the steering wheel or the headset -- I mean, the

        3    headrest had hit the back of my head, or my head hit

        4    the headrest, whichever one you want to call it, but

        5    I felt that impact.

        6    Q.       Did your body move forward?  Is that what

        7    you are stating?

        8    A.       Yeah.  Well, the car hit me and it slammed

        9    my head into the headrest, which caused the stress

       10    of my stomach and then the back of my head.

       11    Q.       Okay.  So, your body moved backwards if you

       12    hit the headrest?

       13    A.       Yeah, but it moved forward into the

       14    seatbelt.

       15    Q.       It moved forward and backward, to

       16    summarize?

       17    A.       Yeah, exactly.

       18    Q.       Once the seatbelt locked up?  Is that what

       19    you meant?

       20    A.       Right.  Yeah.

       21    Q.       And I think we have covered this a little

       22    bit, but just to specifically ask, did your body

       23    strike anything inside the vehicle?

       24    A.       Yes.  Definitely the headrest.





                                                                15


        1    Q.       Anything else that you can recall?

        2    A.       Being pushed up against the seatbelt more.

        3    Q.       Okay.  Did you have any open cuts or

        4    bruises?

        5    A.       No.

        6    Q.       I think you briefly mentioned this as well,

        7    but did you lose consciousness?

        8    A.       Yes.

        9    Q.       And then after impact what happened?

       10    A.       After impact, I -- Well, I looked back out

       11    the window to see -- I looked back out the rearview

       12    mirror to see if the car was there.  And then I

       13    didn't see a car behind me.  And then I exited my

       14    car.  I saw my car was hit, and I'm like, Wow.

       15    Like, What happened?

       16                 And then I looked at the guy -- Well, I

       17    looked at the car that was behind me at that time.

       18    I said, Did you hit me?  And he was like, No, no.

       19                 And I looked at this other car, and I

       20    said, Did you hit me?  And he's like, No.

       21                 I said, Do you know who hit me?  And

       22    then he was like, Oh, it's the car up there.

       23                 So the person that hit me had taken

       24    off.





                                                                16


        1                 So, then I drove up in the middle of

        2    the median on Columbia Avenue to find the car with

        3    the front end damage.  And then finally I'm like,

        4    You hit me.  And she's like, Yeah.

        5                 I said, You've got to pull over in this

        6    lot.  So then I pulled over in the lot, and she was

        7    like, Well, you know, I didn't think it was that

        8    bad, or something like that.

        9                 I said, Hey, you've got to wait for the

       10    police to come.  And she's like, I have to go; I

       11    have to pick up my children.  How long is that going

       12    to take?  I said, Well, I don't know how long it's

       13    going to take, but we have to wait for the police.

       14                 And I said, Your car is leaking.  And

       15    she said, Oh, my car is leaking?  Am I going to be

       16    able to get to work?  Is it okay to drive like this?

       17                 I'm, like, Listen.  I don't know about

       18    your situation, but we have to wait for the police

       19    to come.

       20    Q.       Okay.

       21    A.       And then she attempted to drive off and

       22    then I had to park her in so she couldn't pull out.

       23    It was a disaster.

       24    Q.       Just some followup questions on that.





                                                                17


        1                 So the impact, you stated that you were

        2    stopped on Columbia Avenue, correct?

        3    A.       Correct.

        4    Q.       And then you felt the impact and then she

        5    drove away?

        6    A.       Correct.

        7    Q.       So you followed her on Columbia Avenue?

        8    A.       I had to catch up to her because it was a

        9    traffic jam on Columbia Avenue.  Well, not a traffic

       10    jam, but everybody was stopped.

       11                 And then, again, once I was hit, she

       12    pulled over.  Like I pulled into the median just to

       13    try to let the traffic pass, and then other people

       14    were going onto the shoulder to go around me.  And

       15    then that's when the guy -- somebody was like, Hey,

       16    there's a car up there.  And I drove up, you know,

       17    beside the car actually to figure out who it was.

       18    And then I was able to.

       19    Q.       How were you able to get her attention?

       20    A.       I was like, Hey.  Because I looked at her

       21    car and I was like, Hey, you hit me, pull over.  And

       22    then that's when she pulled over.

       23    Q.       So she had her window down and you were

       24    able --





                                                                18


        1    A.       No.  I was just signifying.

        2    Q.       Okay.

        3    A.       Yeah.

        4    Q.       So you were just making hand gestures for

        5    her to pull off the side of the road?

        6    A.       Correct.

        7    Q.       And she did so, obviously?

        8    A.       Yes.

        9    Q.       And you said you pulled over into a parking

       10    lot?

       11    A.       Correct.

       12    Q.       I think the police report might have said

       13    it was a --

       14    A.       Dairy Queen.

       15    Q.       -- Dairy Queen parking lot.  Does that

       16    sound correct?

       17    A.       Yes.

       18    Q.       And who called the police?

       19    A.       I called the police.

       20    Q.       And you mentioned that you had a

       21    conversation with her and that was basically about

       22    how she had to go and pick up her kids and her

       23    vehicle was drivable?

       24    A.       Correct.





                                                                19


        1    Q.       Was anything else done?

        2    A.       Excuse me?

        3    Q.       Did she say anything else?

        4    A.       She just said, I am going to be late to

        5    pick up my children; I can't be late.  And, I have

        6    to go, and, I can't wait here.

        7    Q.       I think you stated that you parked her in

        8    so that she couldn't leave, correct?

        9    A.       Yeah.

       10    Q.       So when the police arrived, she was still

       11    there?

       12    A.       Correct.

       13    Q.       Did you speak to the police?

       14    A.       Did I speak to the police?

       15    Q.       Yes.

       16    A.       Yes.

       17    Q.       Did you tell them the same thing you just

       18    told me?

       19    A.       Yes.

       20    Q.       How did you leave the accident scene?

       21    A.       I left the accident scene in my vehicle.

       22    Q.       So your vehicle was drivable at that point?

       23    A.       Yes.

       24    Q.       Did the police ask you if you wanted an





                                                                20


        1    ambulance?

        2    A.       Yes.

        3    Q.       What did you say?

        4    A.       I said no.

        5    Q.       Why did you say no?

        6    A.       I said no because at the time I wanted to

        7    get home from the accident.

        8    Q.       So even though you said you lost

        9    consciousness, you still didn't want to get that

       10    checked out?

       11    A.       Not at the moment.

       12    Q.       And then where did you go?

       13    A.       I went home.

       14    Q.       And then where was the next place that you

       15    sought treatment for injuries sustained in the

       16    accident?

       17    A.       So after I went home, I was like, wow, I'm

       18    feeling kind of foggy.  You know what, I never felt

       19    this way before, so I went to the emergency room.

       20    Q.       So you drove yourself to the emergency

       21    room?

       22    A.       I believe my wife drove me to the emergency

       23    room.

       24    Q.       Do you approximately know how many hours





                                                                21


        1    you went to the emergency room after the accident?

        2    A.       I don't know.

        3    Q.       Is it the same day, though?

        4    A.       Yeah.  I think so, yeah.

        5                 Or, no.  It was probably the day later.

        6    I don't know.

        7    Q.       The same day or a day later?

        8    A.       Yeah.

        9    Q.       At that point where were you feeling pain

       10    on your body?

       11    A.       At that point that's when the pain

       12    intensified, and then I was feeling pain, again, in

       13    the abdomen area, lower back and the back of the

       14    head.

       15    Q.       So on a zero-to-ten pain scale, with zero

       16    being absolutely no pain and ten being the most pain

       17    you ever felt, at that point after the accident, how

       18    would you categorize the pain in your abs?

       19    A.       That was an eight.

       20    Q.       And how about your lower back?

       21    A.       That was the same all around.

       22    Q.       An eight?  And your head was an eight as

       23    well then?

       24    A.       No.  That was a nine.





                                                                22


        1    Q.       Okay.

        2    A.       Yeah.

        3    Q.       And what did the hospital say when you got

        4    there?

        5    A.       They said they would check me out for --

        6    they would check my abs, check my head, give me an

        7    MRI.

        8    Q.       Do you remember the results of the MRI?

        9    A.       I do not remember the results of the MRI.

       10    Q.       Do you remember anything else they did?

       11    A.       No.

       12    Q.       And they discharged you, I'm guessing?

       13    A.       Yes.

       14    Q.       Do you know how long you were at the

       15    hospital prior to discharge?

       16    A.       I was at the hospital for a few hours.

       17    Then they gave me some kind of pain medicine.

       18    Q.       That was my next question:  Upon discharge,

       19    did the hospital say anything or did they provide

       20    you any medication?

       21    A.       They just told me that if I felt groggy or

       22    anything like that, you know, let them know.  If

       23    anything continues to get worse, stop back in, if

       24    anything gets worse.





                                                                23


        1    Q.       I think you mentioned medication.  Do you

        2    remember what kind of medication they gave you?

        3    A.       I don't remember.

        4    Q.       Was it an over-the-counter medication, a

        5    prescription medication, do you remember?

        6    A.       I think they gave me some Tylenol.

        7    Q.       Tylenol?

        8    A.       Yeah.

        9    Q.       Where is the next place that you went for

       10    your injuries?

       11    A.       The next place I went to was to a

       12    chiropractor.

       13    Q.       Do you remember the chiropractor's name?

       14    A.       Sheehan Chiropractic.

       15    Q.       So how did you come to find this

       16    chiropractor?

       17    A.       So, when I went to the chiropractor, I --

       18    Can you repeat the question?

       19    Q.       How did you find the chiropractor?  Did you

       20    look through the phonebook, did someone recommend

       21    you?

       22    A.       Yeah, yeah, yeah.

       23    Q.       Had you previously seen him?

       24    A.       No, no, no.  I had did some research, and





                                                                24


        1    then I was like, all right, I am going to go to this

        2    chiropractor.

        3    Q.       Like a Goggle search?

        4    A.       Yes.

        5    Q.       That's probably what I would have done.

        6    A.       Yeah.

        7    Q.       So you went to the chiropractor, and when

        8    you went to him what did you complain of?

        9    A.       I told him that I was in a car accident.

       10    And then he said, Okay, let me run some tests and

       11    let me see where you are at.

       12    Q.       Do you remember what kind of tests he ran?

       13    A.       He did a spinal alignment test just to --

       14    and then he did some kind of muscle testing to

       15    measure if different muscles are being stressed out.

       16    Q.       Do you remember the results of those tests?

       17    A.       He said that I had damage or muscle

       18    intensity in my lower back and the back of my head

       19    and shoulders.

       20    Q.       You said in your lower back, back of your

       21    head and shoulders?

       22    A.       Yeah.

       23    Q.       And then what did he say?

       24    A.       He said that having -- getting an alignment





                                                                25


        1    or getting some kind of treatments would help reduce

        2    that, reduce those stresses.

        3    Q.       And at this point when you went to see the

        4    chiropractor, we talked earlier about that pain

        5    scale and you had put your lower back at an eight.

        6                 Had it intensified, lowered or stayed

        7    at that pain level?

        8    A.       At that time it was the same.

        9    Q.       And how about your head?

       10    A.       The same.

       11    Q.       A nine?

       12    A.       Yes.

       13    Q.       And what about your abs at this point?

       14    A.       It was the same.

       15    Q.       Did he say anything about that?

       16    A.       Actually, he was the one that said, hey.  I

       17    said, I don't know what's going on, but my abs hurt.

       18                 And then he was like, Yeah, that can be

       19    from your seatbelt locking up from the impact.  And

       20    I was like, Oh, that makes sense because I never

       21    felt my abs be that tight before.  Or maybe it

       22    wasn't tight; it was just the seatbelt just catching

       23    me.

       24    Q.       Did you have any bruising there from the





                                                                26


        1    seatbelt?  Sometimes people do.

        2    A.       I don't recall.

        3    Q.       You said that the chiropractor recommended

        4    alignments; is that correct?

        5    A.       Yeah.  He recommended alignments, and he

        6    did some other tests.  And then he said, you know,

        7    Are you having trouble concentrating or something

        8    like that?  And I was like, Yeah, I feel like foggy.

        9    And then he was like, Well, it's possible that you

       10    suffered a concussion.  And I said, Well -- and then

       11    he asked me did I ever have any concussions before,

       12    and said I said no.  And he said, You have the

       13    symptoms of a concussion.

       14    Q.       Okay.

       15    A.       And I was like, Well, that makes sense

       16    because I wasn't feeling as sharp as I normally

       17    feel.  For the things that I do I am normally one

       18    hundred percent focused and I just could not get

       19    that focus back.

       20    Q.       What else did he say?

       21    A.       He said, you know, You can start this

       22    treatment and these treatments will have a

       23    possibility of being able to get you back to the way

       24    that you used to be.





                                                                27


        1    Q.       The treatments being the alignments?

        2    A.       The treatments was -- Yes.

        3    Q.       Did he recommend any treatment for the

        4    concussion?

        5    A.       Did he recommend any treatment for the

        6    concussion?  No.  He just said that, you know,

        7    getting an alignment would alleviate some -- it

        8    would alleviate some stress on the joints and it's

        9    probably muscles that are swelling up that are

       10    keeping me out of alignment.

       11    Q.       And did you have those alignments?

       12    A.       Yes.

       13    Q.       And did they help you?

       14    A.       Yes.  For a few hours.

       15    Q.       So they would help you for a few hours and

       16    then the pain would come back?

       17    A.       Yes.

       18    Q.       Do you know how many sessions you went

       19    through?

       20    A.       Yeah.  I was going three times a week for

       21    months.

       22    Q.       At some point were you discharged or are

       23    you still getting alignments?

       24    A.       I go to a different chiropractor now.





                                                                28


        1    Q.       We'll get to that then.  Just this one.

        2    A.       All right.  Just for this one, yeah, I went

        3    to him for, like I said, like seven months.

        4    Q.       Seven months?

        5    A.       Yeah.  At least.

        6    Q.       Were you discharged or did you just leave

        7    on your own?

        8    A.       How did that go down?  I think I wound up

        9    leaving on my own.

       10    Q.       Upon leaving, did you still have pain in

       11    your abs, lower back and head?

       12    A.       It had decreased some, but I know that it's

       13    still there.

       14    Q.       When you say it decreased some, upon

       15    discharge where would you put the pain on your abs?

       16    A.       I would say that went down to maybe like a

       17    six.

       18    Q.       And how about your back?

       19    A.       The back is just a continuous stressor, so

       20    maybe like down one, to like a seven.

       21    Q.       How about your head?

       22    A.       An eight.

       23    Q.       Did he say these alignments were going to

       24    help the pain in your abs?





                                                                29


        1    A.       No.

        2    Q.       Let's talk about that then.

        3                 Did you ever seek any treatment to

        4    alleviate the pain in your abs?

        5    A.       I never sought any treatment for the abs.

        6    Q.       You never sought any treatment?

        7    A.       I was always healthy, so I thought maybe if

        8    I went to the gym or something like that, or tried

        9    to do something else, it would just go away.

       10    Q.       Did it go away?

       11    A.       The abs aren't as bad as it was, but...

       12    Q.       Presently sitting here today, are you

       13    feeling pain in your abs?

       14    A.       Not in the abs, no.

       15    Q.       Are there times where you do feel pain in

       16    your abs throughout the day?

       17    A.       No.

       18    Q.       So you don't -- it's not an issue anymore?

       19    A.       No.

       20    Q.       So then we'll go back to your back and your

       21    head.

       22                 So after you were done the sessions

       23    with Dr. Sheehan, where is the next place you sought

       24    treatment?





                                                                30


        1    A.       The next place I sought treatment was, I

        2    believe it was in Philadelphia, and I did some --

        3    Sheehan's had recommended that I go to a nerve

        4    damage specialist.

        5    Q.       Would that have been Dr. Grossinger?  Does

        6    that sound familiar?

        7    A.       Yes.

        8    Q.       When you went to Dr. Grossinger, what did

        9    you complain of?

       10    A.       I complained of the back of my head and

       11    lower back.

       12    Q.       And what did he do for you?

       13    A.       He did some -- I believe he did some stim

       14    treatment maybe or an EK -- I don't know the

       15    terminology of what he did.

       16    Q.       An EMG?

       17    A.       Yeah.  That sounds familiar, yeah.

       18    Q.       He ran some tests on you?

       19    A.       Yes.

       20    Q.       To that effect?

       21    A.       Yes.

       22    Q.       Do you remember the results of any of

       23    those?

       24    A.       I believe that he said that I should





                                                                31


        1    continue with my treatments from Sheehan.  Because I

        2    remember there was some other doctor that did some

        3    nerve damage treatment.

        4    Q.       Would that have be Dr. Michele Holding of

        5    Advantage Medical & Rehabilitation?

        6    A.       Yes.  Yeah.

        7    Q.       Okay.  They did some nerve damage testing?

        8    A.       Yes.

        9    Q.       Do you remember the results of those?

       10    A.       Yes.  Damaged nerves.

       11    Q.       Do you remember where they said those

       12    nerves were that were damaged?

       13    A.       She said -- I just remember her saying that

       14    I had some nerve damage.

       15    Q.       Do you remember if that was in your back,

       16    your neck?

       17    A.       She did treatment all over.  When she was

       18    treating me, she did something in my hands and then

       19    through my arms.  So I don't know where she was

       20    treating or what the test results -- I don't know

       21    how the test ran for her to know what -- I don't do

       22    the testing, so I don't know, but I know that the

       23    tests weren't positive for my situation.

       24    Q.       Okay.





                                                                32


        1    A.       That's what she related to me, because I

        2    wasn't responding to something that she was doing.

        3    And then I was like, What's going on?  And then she

        4    was like, That's because you have nerve damage.  And

        5    I was like, All right.  I didn't know.

        6    Q.       Let's just go to back to Dr. Grossinger.

        7    When you saw him, he told you to continue with Dr.

        8    Sheehan, correct?

        9    A.       Yes.

       10    Q.       Did he tell you anything else?

       11    A.       No.

       12    Q.       Recommend anything else?

       13    A.       No.

       14    Q.       What did Dr. Holding tell you?

       15    A.       She said for me to continue treatment with

       16    Dr. Sheehan also.

       17    Q.       And did you do that?

       18    A.       Yes.

       19    Q.       And did that help at all?

       20    A.       As I continued with him?

       21    Q.       Yes.

       22    A.       Like some -- After I would get an

       23    alignment, it would be okay.  So if I was

       24    continuously getting the alignments, then I would be





                                                                33


        1    okay, but if I would go like two to three, four days

        2    without getting treatment, then everything would go

        3    back to being in a tight spot and I would feel

        4    unaligned.

        5    Q.       I think you said at some point you stopped

        6    treating with Dr. Sheehan, correct?

        7    A.       Correct.

        8    Q.       Do you remember when that was?

        9    A.       No.

       10    Q.       Would that have been -- Do you remember the

       11    year?  Would it have been 2016, 2017, 2018?

       12    A.       Ah...

       13    Q.       Because I think the last thing that I have

       14    with him was back in 2016, around December, November

       15    of 2016.

       16    A.       So that was like a year after the accident

       17    then?

       18    Q.       Yeah.

       19    A.       Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  That is pretty

       20    much -- after I stopped seeing him, then I went to

       21    Long's Chiropractic.

       22    Q.       Why did you switch to Long's Chiropractic?

       23    A.       They were like more convenient, closer to

       24    my house.





                                                                34


        1    Q.       How did you find them?  The same thing with

        2    the Google search?

        3    A.       Yes.

        4    Q.       When you went to see them, did you complain

        5    of the same thing with your lower back and your

        6    head?

        7    A.       Yes.

        8    Q.       Anything else did you complain of?

        9    A.       I told them about my knee.

       10    Q.       What knee?

       11    A.       My left knee.

       12    Q.       When did the pain in your left knee start?

       13    A.       It started -- Like after the accident, I

       14    noticed that I wasn't able to, like, go up the

       15    steps.  I was having back -- I was having some back

       16    issues.  I was having back issues, so I couldn't

       17    lift things that I would normally be able to lift.

       18    And then, when I would go up the steps, I noticed

       19    that hey, my knee doesn't feel like I can go up the

       20    steps like I normally would do.

       21                 So when I was getting the back therapy

       22    done, he said, Hey, you are out of alignment and

       23    that causes your -- if your back is out of

       24    alignment, it can also make your knee be out of





                                                                35


        1    alignment and the whole rest of your body be out of

        2    alignment.

        3                 I was like, all right.  That makes

        4    sense, but I said, I didn't have this issue before I

        5    had that accident.  And he said, yeah, that happens

        6    a lot.  And I was like, Oh, okay.

        7                 And he was then able to do, like, you

        8    know, some adjustments with my knee and my back.

        9    And then he did some stim therapy, electroids, stims

       10    to my back and shoulders.

       11    Q.       This is Long's Chiropractic, just to

       12    clarify that?

       13    A.       Correct.

       14    Q.       Did you ever complain about your knee to

       15    Dr. Sheehan?

       16    A.       Yes.

       17    Q.       What did he say?

       18    A.       He had said the same thing, but that was --

       19    it was only triggered like when my back was like

       20    intensified, or like when all of a sudden my back

       21    would start to hurt, the knee would hurt also.  It

       22    was like a combo.

       23                 But when the back was like any lower

       24    than what it was, the knee would go away.  So they





                                                                36


        1    were like tied together.

        2    Q.       You associate your knee pain with your back

        3    pain?

        4    A.       Yes.

        5    Q.       Did you ever seek any treatment

        6    independently for your knee where they ran tests or

        7    anything to that effect?

        8    A.       Yeah.  Yeah, I did.

        9    Q.       Where did you go?

       10    A.       I went to OAL.

       11    Q.       Do you know when you went there?

       12    A.       It was in, I would say, the fall of that

       13    next year maybe.

       14    Q.       So the fall of 2017?

       15    A.       Yeah.  And I was there last year for the

       16    same thing.

       17    Q.       What did they do for you?

       18    A.       They ran some tests to see if there were

       19    like any ligament damage done.

       20                 Oh, and then I also went to East Pete

       21    Family Health for the same thing.

       22    Q.       Let's start with OAL.  What did they do for

       23    you there?

       24    A.       They did some -- I went maybe like two or





                                                                37


        1    three times to a therapy session.

        2    Q.       To a physical therapy session?

        3    A.       Yes.

        4    Q.       And did that help at all?

        5    A.       Well, I couldn't continue with the physical

        6    therapy because it was too expensive, but they gave

        7    me some treatments and told me what treatments to do

        8    at home.

        9    Q.       And when you went to go see OAL, on that

       10    zero-to-ten pain scale, how would you put the pain

       11    in your left knee?

       12    A.       The pain -- the pain was only going up the

       13    stairs, so at that point it was excruciating, so I

       14    would say it was around like an eight, nine.

       15    Q.       Did they run any tests on you to see if

       16    there was anything --

       17    A.       Yeah.  They did range of motion tests.

       18    Q.       And what did that say?

       19    A.       They said that they don't think I had any

       20    ligament damage.  And it wasn't like any, like,

       21    bone-on-bone type issue.  But they said I should try

       22    to, like, you know, keep doing back exercises, that

       23    that would help out my knee.

       24    Q.       And you mentioned East Pete Family Health





                                                                38


        1    for your knee.  What did they do for you?

        2    A.       That's the initial -- that's my family

        3    doctor.  So, I had to go to the family doctor to be

        4    able to see the specialist.

        5    Q.       Okay.  So your family doctor referred you

        6    to OAL?

        7    A.       Yeah.

        8    Q.       Did your family doctor run any tests prior

        9    to referring you or just --

       10    A.       Yeah.  When I went to see the family

       11    doctor, she did some tests and she said, Hey, it

       12    looks like it could be -- a specialist should take a

       13    look at you.

       14    Q.       And how long has East Pete Family Health

       15    been your primary care physician?

       16    A.       I would say 20 years, maybe.

       17    Q.       So, you say you did two or three physical

       18    therapy sessions and then they gave you some home

       19    exercises that you could do?

       20    A.       Yes.

       21    Q.       Did you do those home exercises?

       22    A.       Yes.

       23    Q.       Do they help?

       24    A.       Yes.





                                                                39


        1    Q.       Did you seek any other treatment for your

        2    knee pain specifically, not associated with your

        3    back, just for your knee?

        4    A.       No.

        5    Q.       And presently sitting here today, do you

        6    still only experience the knee pain when you

        7    experience back pain?

        8    A.       Yes.

        9    Q.       When that happens, is it still on the eight

       10    to nine level of pain?

       11    A.       Yes.

       12    Q.       Have you ever thought about seeking any

       13    other independent treatment for your knee?

       14    A.       No, because it's been such a long time that

       15    I just feel like it's something I got to deal with

       16    the rest of my life.

       17    Q.       Do you plan on seeking any other treatment?

       18    A.       I think I have maxed out what's available

       19    for me.

       20    Q.       If you had the financial means, would that

       21    be something you would seek treatment for your knee?

       22    A.       I don't like to get cut or anything like

       23    that.  But at one point I thought that that was a

       24    possibility, that they were, like, torn ligaments or





                                                                40


        1    something like that.  And I'm just -- I don't want

        2    to go under a knife for it, so I tried to do it as

        3    best as possible on my own.

        4    Q.       So presently sitting here today, you don't

        5    have any future appointments scheduled or you are

        6    not looking into anything for treatment for your

        7    knee?

        8    A.       Correct.

        9    Q.       Let's go back to your back and your head

       10    with Long's Chiropractic.

       11    A.       Yeah.

       12    Q.       I think you said that they did some

       13    treatment on you.

       14    A.       Yes.

       15    Q.       What kind of treatment did they do?

       16    A.       They did alignments.

       17    Q.       Alignments?

       18    A.       Yes.

       19    Q.       The same sort of alignments that Dr.

       20    Sheehan did?

       21    A.       You said Sheehan first, right?

       22    Q.       We're talking about Long's now.  And you

       23    said that they did alignments.

       24    A.       Yes.  Yes, he did the same thing that





                                                                41


        1    Sheehan did.

        2    Q.       And did they help you?

        3    A.       Yeah, they helped when -- I go when the

        4    pain starts to intensify, and I go and I get relief.

        5    So once it builds up to the point that I can't take

        6    anymore, then I go.

        7    Q.       Do you know how often that is?

        8    A.       Seems like it spurs up every, like three,

        9    four times a year, maybe.

       10    Q.       So three or four times a year?

       11    A.       Yeah.

       12    Q.       Are there certain things that cause it to

       13    act up that you're aware of or is it just randomly?

       14    A.       It's just randomly.

       15    Q.       Are you presently still treating with

       16    Long's Chiropractic?

       17    A.       I mean, I don't have like a treatment plan,

       18    but like I said before, when it intensifies, then

       19    that's when I go.

       20    Q.       Do you know the last time you were there?

       21    A.       It was probably like the fall of, I would

       22    say, probably last year.

       23    Q.       The fall of 2018?

       24    A.       Probably, yeah.





                                                                42


        1    Q.       And so, for the year of 2018, did you see

        2    him three to four times?

        3    A.       In 2018?  I don't know.

        4    Q.       Would it have been more than four times?

        5    A.       It wouldn't have been more than four times.

        6    Q.       How about in 2017, can you approximate how

        7    many times you saw him?

        8    A.       I probably saw him at least, like, two

        9    times.

       10    Q.       And you probably started seeing him in

       11    2017, correct, because prior to that you were seeing

       12    Dr. Sheehan?

       13    A.       Right.

       14    Q.       So just to summarize, you don't have any

       15    future appointments scheduled with him or it's not

       16    something you regularly do, just when the pain

       17    intensifies --

       18    A.       Yes.

       19    Q.       -- you go to seek the alignments?

       20    A.       Correct.

       21    Q.       Did you see anyone else for your --

       22    A.       No.

       23    Q.       -- back or your head?

       24    A.       No.





                                                                43


        1    Q.       You didn't see anyone else.

        2                 So presently sitting here today on that

        3    zero-to-ten pain scale where would you put the pain

        4    in your back?

        5    A.       The pain in the back here right now, I

        6    would say it's a -- it's ongoing, so you become numb

        7    to it.  It's an eight.

        8    Q.       What about your head?

        9    A.       The head is -- It's the same situation with

       10    my head.  It's just like -- when I get into like a,

       11    it's like a stressor.  If I'm under stress, I start

       12    to get a throb in the back of my head that I didn't

       13    get before the accident.  So, any time that I can

       14    have anything that, I guess, makes me stressful or

       15    puts unusual stress on me, then I feel like this

       16    throb in the back of the neck and head area.

       17    Q.       And how would you characterize that pain on

       18    a zero-to-ten pain scale?

       19    A.       When it happens, it's an eight.

       20    Q.       And it happens when you're stressed, so not

       21    just sitting here today?

       22    A.       Correct.

       23    Q.       With your back, when you said it was an

       24    eight, does that also occur when you get stressed or





                                                                44


        1    is that a constant eight?

        2    A.       When I try to do something like outside of

        3    my normal range of motion, I would say, or like how

        4    I used to be able to do things.  If I'm trying to

        5    move something, then I have to, like, get my body

        6    ready to do it.  Because I think I'm a fit person,

        7    so when I'm ready to move something, I got to

        8    think -- like you got to think twice, Hey, can I

        9    really move this right now, or do I have to get my

       10    wife to help me or a friend to help me move

       11    something that I would normally be able to move,

       12    because I don't want to get this sharp pain.

       13                 And if I get this sharp pain, then that

       14    feels like all my muscles tighten up around my back

       15    and my head.  And then, it's like, okay, then I'm

       16    under stress, and then all of those things are just

       17    like a -- just like a stew, you know, like you just

       18    add an ingredient, add an ingredient, and then it

       19    will just all blow up.  Then I go to the

       20    chiropractor.  Then it releases that stress, you

       21    know, until the next situation happens.

       22    Q.       So I think basically maybe to summarize

       23    what you said, when you are doing something out of

       24    your normal routine, such as lifting something up or





                                                                45


        1    doing something that requires heavy lifting, that's

        2    what aggravates the pain?

        3    A.       Yes.

        4    Q.       Just sitting here doing your normal

        5    everyday activities, do you feel pain in your back?

        6    A.       During my normal activities?

        7    Q.       Just sitting here talking to me right now.

        8    A.       No.  No.

        9    Q.       So you don't feel the pain during your

       10    normal activities; it's just when you have to do

       11    something out of your normal?

       12    A.       Yes.

       13    Q.       Have you thought about seeking any other

       14    treatment for your head or your back pain?

       15    A.       I have.  I constantly think about it

       16    because any time that -- any time that I have any

       17    stress, I'm like, Oh, man, this is going to make me

       18    require a $50 payment back to the chiropractor

       19    again.  It's an annoyance is what it is.

       20    Q.       Have you taken any more steps, other than

       21    thinking about it?  Have you looked into it at all?

       22    A.       Yeah.  I know that that's the only relief

       23    that I get is when I go to the chiropractor.  So I

       24    could either continuously pay for the chiropractor





                                                                46


        1    and go like once a month or whatever it may be, but

        2    like I said before, I just go when it intensifies.

        3    So I try to keep myself from dealing with high

        4    stress situations, definitely for the back of my

        5    head, and I try to stay away from any heavy lifting.

        6    Q.       Okay.  Outside of seeing a chiropractor,

        7    have you ever thought about seeing another doctor

        8    and having other tests run regarding your head or

        9    your back?

       10    A.       I haven't -- I haven't sought out any

       11    additional help, because I saw like three or four

       12    people and they all said the same thing, so it's

       13    like throwing the towel in, just like giving up and

       14    knowing I'm just going to have to deal with this.

       15    Q.       When you said you saw three or four people,

       16    were those the people we have already spoken about?

       17    A.       Yes.

       18    Q.       Just to clarify that.

       19    A.       Yes.

       20    Q.       You don't have any future appointments

       21    scheduled to see any other doctors or anything to

       22    that effect?

       23    A.       If I could predict when I am going to have

       24    some stress, I would make an appointment right after





                                                                47


        1    that.

        2    Q.       I meant to another doctor to run tests or

        3    anything like that.

        4    A.       No.

        5    Q.       Are you presently taking any medication for

        6    your pain?

        7    A.       No.

        8    Q.       I think I have a note here, did you see a

        9    doctor, I'm not going to say this correctly,

       10    Stepanuk?

       11    A.       Stepanuk.

       12    Q.       Stepanuk.

       13    A.       Yes, yeah.  I did see that doctor, yes.

       14    Q.       Do you remember what that doctor said to

       15    you?

       16    A.       I believe he was also checking me out for

       17    one of those three initial tests, MRI, EKG.  I don't

       18    remember what it was.

       19    Q.       Why did you see him?

       20    A.       Because I believe that when I went to

       21    Sheehan, he said, Hey, you need to see this other

       22    doctor maybe to get some relief.  Go see this guy

       23    and let him do some testing on you that he couldn't

       24    do at his facility.





                                                                48


        1    Q.       Do you remember what those tests said?

        2    A.       He said that he was going to send the tests

        3    back to Sheehan.

        4    Q.       Do you know if he did that?

        5    A.       Yeah, because I remember when I went back

        6    to Sheehan, he said they got the test results back

        7    from Stepanuk and that I should continue my

        8    treatment with him.

        9    Q.       Continue your treatment with Dr. Sheehan?

       10    A.       Correct.

       11    Q.       Did he mention anything about injections as

       12    a possibility to control your pain?

       13    A.       I don't recall.

       14    Q.       You don't recall?

       15    A.       (No response.)

       16    Q.       Is that something that you would be open to

       17    trying if it could alleviate your pain?

       18    A.       I would not be open to injections.

       19    Q.       And why not?

       20    A.       Because I don't like to get poked with

       21    anything.  I can't even get my blood drawn without

       22    freaking out.

       23    Q.       Me either.

       24    A.       Okay.  I just...





                                                                49


        1    Q.       Me either.

        2    A.       I've just got to look away.  And I normally

        3    don't go to doctors because I'm normally fit.

        4    Q.       So that's not a treatment you would look

        5    into, injections?

        6    A.       No.

        7    Q.       Has any doctor ever mentioned a surgery to

        8    you?  Specifically Dr. Stepanuk?

        9    A.       No.

       10    Q.       Is surgery something you would be open to

       11    if you were told it would alleviate your pain?

       12    A.       Yes.

       13    Q.       So, you would be open to surgery?

       14    A.       Yeah, if it got to the point that I just

       15    couldn't bear it anymore, then of course I got to

       16    try to relieve my pain.

       17    Q.       So would you say that surgery would be a

       18    last resort option for you?

       19    A.       Yes.

       20    Q.       Do you remember Doctor -- how do you say it

       21    again?

       22    A.       Stepanuk.

       23    Q.       Dr. Stepanuk, okay.  I don't know why

       24    that's so hard for me.





                                                                50


        1                 Do you remember Dr. Stepanuk mentioning

        2    anything about arthritis or degenerative changes?

        3    A.       I don't recall.

        4    Q.       Have you ever heard a doctor mention that

        5    to you?

        6    A.       Mention -- what was those words you had

        7    said?

        8    Q.       That they saw arthritis or degenerative

        9    changes during your tests.

       10    A.       I don't recall.  I remember someone saying

       11    it, but I don't know which doctor said it.

       12    Q.       Do you remember anything that they said to

       13    you about it?

       14    A.       No, because I don't remember who it was.

       15    Q.       Okay.

       16    A.       Yeah.  I do remember the nerve damage one

       17    because that was a really difficult test to take.

       18    Q.       And was that the test that he did or was

       19    that the one that Dr. Holding did?

       20    A.       Holding, yeah.

       21    Q.       Were you taking any medications prior to

       22    this accident?

       23    A.       No.

       24    Q.       And I think I asked this already:  Are you





                                                                51


        1    taking any medications presently because of this

        2    accident?

        3    A.       No.

        4    Q.       Did any doctor say that your injuries were

        5    caused by this accident?

        6    A.       Yes.

        7    Q.       Who said that?

        8    A.       Sheehan.

        9    Q.       And what specific injury did he say was

       10    caused by this accident?

       11    A.       He said that it was possible that I had a

       12    concussion from the accident, which made me like

       13    black out.  So that's what -- I mean, I just call it

       14    a blackout.  He was like, It's a concussion; that's

       15    what probably happened to you.

       16                 I said yeah, but...  He said, Did you

       17    hit your head?  And I was like, I didn't think I had

       18    actually hit my head because I didn't have any marks

       19    on my forehead, but I was just thinking of my

       20    forehead.  I didn't think that my headrest had

       21    slammed into the back of my head.

       22    Q.       Did he say that he thought that your lower

       23    back pain was caused by this accident?

       24    A.       Yes.  So he ran tests at the beginning and





                                                                52


        1    then he ran tests at the end of my therapy with him.

        2    And there was a chart and it showed all the

        3    different stress areas.  And I believe it was pretty

        4    much the same, with just like some areas changed a

        5    little bit, but it wasn't -- it didn't like totally

        6    clear out.

        7    Q.       And he said this was caused by the

        8    accident?

        9    A.       He said that I definitely had a concussion.

       10    And I said, Well, I know I didn't feel unfocused

       11    before I came -- before the accident, and that's

       12    what his conclusion was.

       13    Q.       How about your lower back pain, did he say

       14    that was caused by the accident?

       15    A.       He said that's the whole combination of a

       16    rear -- a rear-end accident.

       17    Q.       Okay.  And same thing with your head?

       18    A.       Correct.

       19    Q.       It was caused by the accident?

       20    A.       Yes.

       21    Q.       Just to clarify, you mentioned something

       22    before when you said the back of your head, and I

       23    think then you mentioned your neck.

       24                 Is your neck pain associated also with





                                                                53


        1    your head?  That's not something that --

        2    A.       I mean, it's the back of my head, so it's

        3    not like the top part.  It's just like the lower

        4    part.  So, you know, at some point your head becomes

        5    your neck, so it's that whole section right there.

        6    Q.       So any time that you were mentioning you

        7    had pain in your head, you meant the pain in your

        8    neck/head area?  Is that correct to say?

        9    A.       Yes.  The neck/head area, yes.

       10    Q.       And just to summarize everything, when we

       11    were talking about the pain that you had experienced

       12    in your accident, you said you had pain in your abs,

       13    your lower back and your head, slash, neck.

       14                 Did you feel any other pain that we

       15    haven't spoken about?

       16    A.       No.

       17    Q.       So just those three areas?

       18    A.       Correct.

       19    Q.       What about prior to this accident, did you

       20    have any health problems?

       21    A.       No.

       22    Q.       Did you have any injuries prior to this

       23    accident?

       24    A.       No.





                                                                54


        1    Q.       Have you been involved in any motor vehicle

        2    accident prior to this one?

        3    A.       No.

        4    Q.       I have a note on March 10th, 2013.  So this

        5    would have been about three years prior to the

        6    accident that we are here for.  It says that you

        7    were at Lancaster Regional Medical Center Emergency

        8    Room complaining of lower back pain following a

        9    motor vehicle accident about 12 hours before this

       10    visit.

       11    A.       When was that?

       12    Q.       March 10, 2013.

       13                 It said a tractor trailer had pulled

       14    forward.  You were a passenger.

       15    A.       Oh, yes.  Yeah.  That was when my wife was

       16    driving.

       17    Q.       You were a passenger in the vehicle?

       18    A.       Correct.

       19    Q.       Why don't you tell me about that?

       20    A.       She -- Let me see.  Oh.  She was driving; I

       21    was on the passenger side.  We were off of an exit

       22    on Route 30 and a tractor trailer backed into the

       23    front of us.  Like he had pulled too far into the

       24    intersection and then he started to reverse, and we





                                                                55


        1    were, like, stuck in the middle.  And then he, like,

        2    ran into the front of the car.

        3    Q.       And were you injured in that accident?

        4    A.       I didn't seek any, like, extra therapy, but

        5    the insurance company recommended that I should go

        6    see somebody if I felt any more worse -- like if I

        7    felt any additional pain.  I went in and then I felt

        8    like I was -- I felt like I was okay.

        9    Q.       I think it mentions in the note that the

       10    emergency room recommended that you see your primary

       11    care physician in two to three days.

       12                 Did you ever end up doing that?

       13    A.       I'm not sure.

       14    Q.       So prior to the accident, did you have any

       15    back pain?

       16    A.       No.

       17    Q.       Have you had any accidents since this

       18    accident?

       19    A.       No.

       20    Q.       I want to talk about what you could do

       21    prior to this accident that you can no longer do;

       22    basically how this accident has affected your life.

       23    A.       What's your question again?  Sorry.

       24    Q.       What could you do prior to this accident





                                                                56


        1    that you can no longer do because of the injuries

        2    sustained in this accident?  So, basically how this

        3    accident affected your life.

        4    A.       So the way this accident has affected my

        5    life is that it's frustrating that I can't focus as

        6    well as I used to be able to focus.  I felt like a

        7    lot of things were more sharp.  I feel like where --

        8    I even feel like sometimes my rate of speech used to

        9    be a lot faster and now it's slower.  I feel like I

       10    can't formulate my sentences regularly, like I can't

       11    get across what I'm thinking in my head.  It makes

       12    me like almost, like, I don't know.  It's just all

       13    jumbled up.

       14                 So that, and then like if I tried to

       15    just go move some furniture around, I have to think

       16    twice.  And then if I go ahead and do it, then

       17    sometimes I can get a sharp pain and then I have to

       18    stop, you know, stop doing that and just wait or get

       19    some help.  But it's just a continuous situation

       20    that I have to think before I do everything that I

       21    do now.

       22    Q.       Anything else?

       23    A.       No.

       24    Q.       Regarding when you said that it was





                                                                57


        1    frustrating with your rate of speech and stuff to

        2    that effect, have you ever thought about seeking out

        3    a doctor to get some tests done regarding your head

        4    to see why that's happening?

        5    A.       Well, I just thought that -- I just thought

        6    it was a new way of life.

        7    Q.       Is there anything that you can't do now

        8    because of this accident?

        9    A.       That I can't do?  I just can't move like I

       10    used to be able to move.

       11    Q.       But nothing specific?

       12    A.       I haven't tried to test myself to a higher

       13    degree to see where my actual limitations are.  I

       14    can just visually look and say, Oh, this dresser, or

       15    this desk, or this TV, like I may not want to do

       16    that because I know that it's going to -- it's

       17    almost like if I move heavier objects, something

       18    around like 40 pounds, 50 pounds, that I feel like

       19    my back, like, collapses and pinches on a nerve and

       20    just shoots a straight pain to my head.

       21                 And it's just like, Put that down.  And

       22    it's like, Okay, let me put it down.  And then

       23    sometimes I can pick it up and then I'm just, like,

       24    careful, like, trying to keep myself, my posture





                                                                58


        1    straight so that I don't pinch anything.  I just try

        2    to move straight without flexing or turning to the

        3    left or to the right too much to cause like -- to

        4    get an inflammation or something like that.

        5    Q.       Do you have to move heavy things often?

        6    A.       No, just when they need to be moved, so...

        7    I'm not a mover.

        8    Q.       Just stuff around the house?

        9    A.       Yeah.  Just stuff around the house.

       10    Q.       And outside of having to move stuff around

       11    the house, does anything else you do cause this

       12    pain?

       13    A.       Like sometimes when I'm -- even if I'm

       14    mopping or something like that, and I try and, like,

       15    twist to mop, you know, something simple like that

       16    can just trigger it also.

       17    Q.       Anything else?  I'm just trying to get a

       18    list of all the triggers that would cause the pain.

       19    A.       Yeah, yeah.  Triggers are like moving

       20    objects.  Triggers are like walking for like a real

       21    extended period of time.

       22                 Yeah, just, you know, like walking

       23    sometimes just makes my back hurt after a while.

       24    Moving objects, walking.  What else?

        1                 Going up the steps is critical, because

        2    I -- especially when you're trying to go up the

        3    steps and you're standing there, like, stretch your

        4    leg out, stretch your back out, and then I go up the

        5    steps.

        6                 It's just more I try to take the

        7    elevator.  I'm always looking for the elevator

        8    versus the steps where I used to be able to take the

        9    steps without a problem, where I used to enjoy

       10    taking the steps.  Now it's like, Do you want to

       11    really do that?

       12    Q.       Anything else?

       13    A.       No.

       14    Q.       Do you belong to a gym or anything?

       15    A.       I belong to -- No.  I don't belong to a gym

       16    now, no.

       17    Q.       Just one question I forgot to ask earlier

       18    regarding Dr. Stepanuk.  Do you recall him saying

       19    anything to you about a disc bulge?

       20    A.       I don't know if he said anything in

       21    particular about a disc bulge, but I know that he

       22    may have -- I remember him saying something like L3,

       23    L4 or something like that.

       24    Q.       C6?

        1    A.       Yeah.  He gave me a letter and a number.

        2    That's all I...

        3    Q.       You don't remember anything specific he

        4    said about it, though?

        5    A.       I can't recall exactly what he said, no.

        6    Q.       Have you taken any trips since this

        7    accident?

        8    A.       Trips as in what?

        9    Q.       Vacations.

       10    A.       Yes.

       11    Q.       Where have you gone?

       12    A.       I'm a pilot, so I have been to a lot of

       13    places.

       14    Q.       How often do you fly?

       15    A.       I fly every -- at least every 60 days.

       16    Q.       Okay.

       17    A.       Personally.

       18    Q.       Where are the kind of places that you fly

       19    to?

       20    A.       This year I have been to Cancun, San

       21    Antonio, Daytona Beach, Connecticut, Boston,

       22    Chicago, BWI, Bonaire.

       23                 No, not Bonaire.  Maybe Bonaire.  I

       24    don't know.

        1    Q.       So, a lot of places?

        2    A.       Yeah.

        3    Q.       You fly frequently?

        4    A.       Yeah.  It's too many to name.

        5    Q.       Okay.  Are you aware if you have any unpaid

        6    medical bills?

        7    A.       I don't have any unpaid -- I don't know.

        8    That's been forwarded personally to me?

        9    Q.       That you know of.

       10    A.       Not that I know.

       11    Q.       Have you had to pay any bills out of

       12    pocket?

       13    A.       I paid my chiropractor bills out of pocket.

       14    Q.       Did you forward that amount to your

       15    attorney?

       16    A.       No.

       17    Q.       You should probably do so.

       18    A.       Yeah, I just...

       19    Q.       Okay.

       20    A.       I will.

       21    Q.       Go on.

       22    A.       I mean, I will forward them.  Yeah, I will.

       23    Q.       Are you aware of any liens that you have

       24    from this accident?





                                                                62


        1    A.       No.

        2    Q.       No liens, or you're not aware of them?

        3    A.       Yeah, no liens.

        4    Q.       And who is your current health insurance

        5    carrier?

        6    A.       That would be Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

        7    Q.       Do you know how long you have had them for?

        8    A.       I think I just switched.  So they do a

        9    fiscal year or something like that.  I'm not sure.

       10                 Yeah, Capital Blue.

       11    Q.       I think that's about all I have.

       12                 Is there anything else you want to say

       13    about this accident or anything about how it

       14    affected your life or anything to that effect?

       15    A.       No.  The only thing that I have is that

       16    it's just really, really frustrating that I can't be

       17    as focused as I used to feel.  Like my attention

       18    span just seems to be less.  And also that my

       19    patience is -- I feel like my patience is less

       20    because of the stress.  So I know that I don't want

       21    to get to a certain point.  So I have to nip things

       22    a little quicker just to be able to maintain my

       23    normal routine.

       24    Q.       Anything else?

        1    A.       That's about it.

        2                 MS. EAGER:  I think that's all I have.

        3                 MR. DOBSON:  Nothing from me.  Thanks.

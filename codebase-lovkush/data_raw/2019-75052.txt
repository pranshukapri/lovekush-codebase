 3                    EUGENE CECCHINO, JR.

 4  the Defendant herein, having been first duly sworn, was 

 5  examined and testified as follows:

 6                        EXAMINATION

 7  BY MS. CORBETT:

 8      Q.   Mr. Cecchino, I have spoken to your attorney and 

 9  also read some documents, so I know that you have hearing 

10  aids; right?

11      A.   Yes.  They're not working too well right now 

12  either.

13      Q.   If I say anything and you can't hear me, just 

14  tell me and I will ask again.  Okay?  Is that fair?

15      A.   Yes.  Right now they are working too loud.

16      Q.   I'll try to get quieter.  Is that better?

17      A.   (No response.)

18      Q.   Now, I'm sure your attorney gave you some 

19  instructions, but for the deposition we want everything we 

20  are answering or saying to be verbal.  Is that okay?  

21      A.   (Witness indicates affirmatively.)

22      Q.   Is that a yes?

23      A.   Yes.

24      Q.   So if at any point I know that you mean yes 

25  because you are nodding your head and I say "is that a 


                                                               5

 1  yes," I'm not trying to be rude.  It's just so she'll 

 2  write it down.  Okay?

 3      A.   Okay.

 4      Q.   In the same vein, I will try to let you finish 

 5  answering before I ask you another question.  Okay?  

 6      A.   Okay.  Yes.

 7      Q.   You are doing great.  Is there any reason that I 

 8  should not take your deposition today?

 9      A.   I didn't understand that.

10      Q.   Have you had any medication or alcohol or 

11  anything that would inhibit your ability to answer 

12  questions today?

13      A.   Yes.

14      Q.   I got it.  That's okay.  Are you okay to take a 

15  deposition today?

16      A.   Yes.

17      Q.   Have you had any medication today that affects 

18  your memory?

19      A.   No.

20      Q.   Have you had any alcohol today?

21      A.   No.

22      Q.   No?

23      A.   No alcohol.

24      Q.   I'll try to be fast then.  Do you remember being 

25  involved in a motor vehicle accident in 2017?


                                                               6

 1      A.   What?  

 2      Q.   Do you remember being involved in a car accident 

 3  in 2017?

 4      A.   October 7, 2017.

 5      Q.   And do you remember where you were going that 

 6  day?

 7      A.   I was having something to eat.  I was on my way 

 8  home because I didn't feel like cooking myself.

 9      Q.   Where did you have something to eat?

10      A.   At a restaurant.

11      Q.   Was it at the Wexford Ale House?  Did you have 

12  something to eat at the Wexford Ale House?

13      A.   Yes.

14      Q.   And the day of the accident or right after the 

15  accident did you get arrested for a DUI for driving under 

16  the influence?

17      A.   Yes; they arrested me.  They said I had one point 

18  over the legal limit.

19      Q.   How many drinks did you have at the Wexford Ale 

20  House?

21      A.   I had a couple.

22      Q.   Do you think it was less than five?

23      A.   Huh?

24      Q.   Was it less than five?

25      A.   Yes.


                                                               7

 1      Q.   What were you drinking that day?  Was it beer, 

 2  or was it a mixed drink?

 3      A.   That's all I drink is beer.

 4      Q.   Do you remember what time of day it was?

 5      A.   I'm not too sure of the time but somewhere 

 6  around 8:30.

 7      Q.   Dinner time; right?

 8      A.   (Witness indicates affirmatively.)

 9      Q.   And so when you left the Ale House, did you feel 

10  okay to drive the vehicle?

11      A.   Yes.

12      Q.   And you are not sure how many drinks you had 

13  had?  

14           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  You can answer.  

15      A.   Just a couple.  That's all I had.

16      Q.   And was the Wexford Ale House the only place 

17  that you had been drinking alcohol that day?

18      A.   No.  I left my apartment because I went down to 

19  the grocery store, got some groceries, and on the way 

20  home I stopped at the Ale House to get something to eat 

21  because I didn't feel like cooking when I got home.  

22      Q.   And then you were involved in a motor vehicle 

23  accident on your way home; is that right?

24      A.   Yes.

25      Q.   As far as that accident goes, were you driving 


                                                               8

 1  on Weller Road -- or Weller Drive, rather?  

 2      A.   It was the road coming out to 19, yes. 

 3      Q.   So you were going to turn on to Perry Highway; is 

 4  that right?

 5      A.   Yes.

 6      Q.   And I don't mean to put words in your mouth; I'm 

 7  just trying to help make it go faster.  So if I'm wrong, 

 8  you just tell me.  

 9      A.   I didn't hear.

10      Q.   I'm not trying to put words in your mouth; I'm 

11  just trying to help you go faster.  So if I'm wrong, just 

12  tell me.  Okay?

13      A.   Okay.

14      Q.   So you were turning on to Perry Highway.  Were 

15  you making a left-hand turn?  

16      A.   I pulled up to the stop sign and I was waiting to 

17  get on to 19.  Traffic was coming both ways.  I don't know 

18  how long I waited there.   I mean, it seemed like an hour. 

19  I mean, the cars were coming one way.  It was clear coming 

20  the one way.  They started coming the other way, so I had 

21  to sit there and wait.  I waited until there was -- I 

22  didn't see no cars either way.  That's when I started to 

23  pull out.

24      Q.   Did you have your glasses on that day?

25      A.   When I get up in the morning, I put my glasses 


                                                               9

 1  on, and I take them off when I go to bed.

 2      Q.   And did you have your hearing aid that day?

 3      A.   Yes.  I had them in.  That pair I lost.

 4      Q.   Where did you lose them?

 5      A.   After the accident, they pried my door to get me 

 6  out.  I was walking down to the ambulance and the guy was 

 7  trying to check my vitals in my ear.  I says, "Oh, wait.  

 8  I'll take my hearing aids out."

 9           He says, "Okay.  We'll take care of them.  We'll 

10  take care of them."

11           And that's the last I seen of the hearing aids.

12      Q.   So where did the ambulance take you; do you 

13  remember?

14      A.   To Passavant.

15      Q.   Okay.

16      A.   Then after that they put me into another 

17  ambulance and they took me down to Presbyterian.

18      Q.   When you were at Passavant, did the police take 

19  your blood, or did they take your blood at Presbyterian?

20      A.   I guess they took my blood down there, yes.

21           MR. CROUMER:  I'm sorry.  Where did they take 

22  your blood?  Which one?  

23           MS. CORBETT:  Passavant.  

24           MR. CROUMER:  At Passavant is where they took 

25  your blood?  


                                                               10

 1           THE WITNESS:  I guess they took it right there 

 2  inside the ambulance.

 3  BY MS. CORBETT:

 4      Q.   Do you remember having your blood drawn at 

 5  Passavant?

 6      A.   I don't remember that.

 7      Q.   Did you hit your head in the accident?

 8      A.   Not in the accident.  I hit my head several years 

 9  ago.  I had 13 stitches in my head.

10      Q.   When you went to UPMC Presbyterian, do you 

11  remember if they took your blood there?

12      A.   No.

13      Q.   But after this accident, you were charged with a 

14  driving under the influence of alcohol; is that right?

15      A.   Yes.

16      Q.   And you eventually pled guilty to that; is that 

17  right?

18      A.   Yes, that's right.

19      Q.   Was it right that this was a DUI for a blood 

20  alcohol level of -- for over a blood alcohol level of 

21  point one?  

22           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.

23      A.   It was one point over eight.  The limit is eight; 

24  mine was nine.

25      Q.   Do you still have a driver's license?


                                                               11

 1      A.   Huh?

 2      Q.   Do you still have a driver's license?

 3      A.   I had a driver's license, yes. 

 4      Q.   Do you have one now?

 5      A.   I sent it in.

 6      Q.   Did they take it as part of your DUI conviction?

 7      A.   I sent it in.  They were supposed to send it back 

 8  to me this August, the 24th of this month.  I'm not 

 9  getting them back.  I gave up driving.

10      Q.   It's not that fun?

11      A.   No.

12      Q.   Had your license ever been suspended before?  

13           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  

14      A.   Yes, one time before, yes. 

15      Q.   Was it for a DUI also?

16      A.   Yes.

17      Q.   How many DUIs have you had?

18      A.   I'm not sure, but I think it was three.

19      Q.   And the other two, when were they?  When were the 

20  DUIs that were not related to this accident, the older 

21  ones?

22      A.   I don't remember that.

23      Q.   Was it in like the nineties?  Does that sound 

24  right?

25      A.   No.  


                                                               12

 1      Q.   And so when you were driving the vehicle that day 

 2  and you had been under the influence of alcohol, do you 

 3  agree with me that it's not safe to drive a vehicle after 

 4  drinking alcohol?

 5            MR. CROUMER:  Objection.

 6      A.   No.

 7      Q.   No; you don't agree with me?

 8      A.   (Witness indicates negatively.)

 9      Q.   Do you think it's safe to drive a vehicle after 

10  drinking alcohol?

11           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.

12      A.   I think I was, yes.

13      Q.   Okay.  And when you pled to the DUI involving 

14  this accident, did you have to go on probation?

15      A.   Pardon me?  

16      Q.   Were you on probation for the DUI?

17      A.   After the accident, I went -- five times I went 

18  down to the courthouse.

19      Q.   Probably for that.  

20      A.   And I got a six months' probation.

21      Q.   And after the accident, you told me that the 

22  firefighters or someone helped you get out of the car; 

23  right?

24      A.   Yes.  They pried the door open because they kept 

25  pounding on there.  They thought I was trying to start the 


                                                               13

 1  car.

 2      Q.   Well, did you -- go ahead. 

 3      A.   My car was automatic lock.  I was trying to get 

 4  it into park so I could open the door.

 5      Q.   And what kind of car were you driving that day?

 6      A.   Huh?

 7      Q.   What kind of car were you driving that day?

 8      A.   A 2002 Pontiac.

 9      Q.   And do you still have that car?

10      A.   No.  It's in the junkyard now.

11      Q.   From this accident?

12      A.   (Witness indicates affirmatively.)

13      Q.   The other vehicle, did you ever speak to the 

14  other driver?

15      A.   I didn't see too much of him.

16      Q.   Did you ever see how he left the scene?

17      A.   No.

18      Q.   And did you ever see -- well, let me ask you this 

19  question.  When was the first time while you were driving 

20  that you noticed the other car?

21      A.   I don't remember that.

22      Q.   Did you see him -- did you see the other vehicle 

23  at all before your cars collided?

24      A.   I didn't see any other cars.  That's why I 

25  started pulling out.


                                                               14

 1      Q.   And did you hear any horns honking?

 2      A.   No.

 3      Q.   Did you hear anyone hitting their brakes really 

 4  hard and then squealing?

 5      A.   There was no skid marks either.  

 6      Q.   So was the first time that you noticed the other 

 7  car was when your cars hit each other?

 8      A.   (Witness indicates affirmatively.)

 9      Q.   Is that a yes?

10      A.   Yes.

11      Q.   What part of your car was hit by his car?

12      A.   I would say the left -- mostly the left front.

13      Q.   The left front of your vehicle?

14      A.   Yes.

15      Q.   In front of the passenger seat or beside the 

16  driver seat?

17      A.   Right there by the driver's side.

18      Q.   What part of his vehicle collided with your 

19  vehicle; if you know?

20      A.   I'm not sure about that.

21      Q.   Did your airbags deploy?

22      A.   I'm not too sure because it happened so fast.

23      Q.   And someone had to pry you out of the car.  Okay. 

24  So did the police officers -- and I think I know the 

25  answer.  Did the police officers ever give you any field 


                                                               15

 1  tests before they took your blood for the DUI?

 2      A.   No.

 3      Q.   Did they ever have you breathe into a 

 4  breathalyzer?

 5      A.   No.

 6      Q.   Is this right, that all they did was take your 

 7  blood to test you?

 8      A.   That's all they did was take my blood.

 9      Q.   Did you have to go to the jail, or did they mail 

10  you your charges?

11      A.   I had to go to the magistrate.  I mean, they just 

12  wrote the ticket out.

13      Q.   But they didn't think you were going to run away; 

14  right?  They didn't think you were a flight risk.  Okay.

15      A.   (No response.)

16           MR. CROUMER:  That was a no; right?  

17           THE WITNESS:  (No response.)

18           MR. CROUMER:  That was a no; right?

19           THE WITNESS:  Do what?  

20           MR. CROUMER:  You want to ask him again?

21           MS. CORBETT:  I'll shorten it.

22  BY MS. CORBETT:

23      Q.   Did you ever have to go to the jail for your DUI?

24      A.   No.

25      Q.   Mr. Cecchino, I know we talked about this 


                                                               16

 1  quickly, but let me ask you one more time and I'll try to 

 2  be really clear.  Do you think, and I don't mean you in 

 3  general, do you think that it is safe to drink alcohol and 

 4  then drive a motor vehicle?  

 5           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  

 6      A.   Yes, I think so, yes.

 7      Q.   And do you think that on this day it was okay for 

 8  you to be driving a motor vehicle?

 9      A.   I think so.

10      Q.   And do you think that having had alcohol had 

11  anything to do with the motor vehicle accident happening?  

12           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  

13      A.   No.

14      Q.   Do you think that it was reckless to drive after 

15  having drank alcohol?  

16           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  

17      A.   No.

18      Q.   And so do you think that this accident still 

19  would have happened if you hadn't had any alcohol?

20      A.   Do that again.  

21      Q.   Do you think you would have been in a car 

22  accident if you hadn't had any alcohol that day?

23      A.   Well, it's hard to say.

24      Q.   Do you think that -- strike that.    

25           Now, I know we talked about the fact that you had 


                                                               17

 1  had your license suspended previously for drinking and 

 2  driving.  Is that right?

 3      A.   Yes.

 4      Q.   Do you think that it is okay to drink and drive 

 5  any time?  

 6           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.

 7      A.   No.

 8      Q.   And is there a certain amount of alcohol that you 

 9  think would make it unsafe to drive?

10      A.   I don't -- no.

11      Q.   And do you realize that Mr. Miller was hurt in 

12  this car accident?  

13      A.   (Witness indicates affirmatively.)

14      Q.   Is that a yes?

15      A.   Yes.

16      Q.   Do you think that this accident would have 

17  happened and he had been hurt if you hadn't been drinking 

18  before you drove?  

19           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  

20      A.   No.

21      Q.   Do you think that you put him in danger by 

22  driving that day?  

23           MR. CROUMER:  Objection.  

24      A.   No.

25      Q.   And Mr. Cecchino, you said that you are not going 


                                                               18

 1  to take your license back; is that right?

 2      A.   I'm not taking them back.

 3      Q.   And is that your choice or PennDOT?  

 4      A.   Huh?

 5      Q.   Is it your choice to not have a license any more, 

 6  or did PennDOT say they won't give it back?

 7      A.   I'm not taking them back.  In fact, I went down 

 8  to the driver center -- the driver center made up a photo 

 9  ID, which I don't understand something about that.  It 

10  says right on the card, it says not legal identification, 

11  but it's a police station more or less, but yet they have 

12  I don't know how many people working there.

13      Q.   They won't let you fly on a plane with it.  You 

14  have to have a passport now, even if you just want to go 

15  to Philadelphia.

16      A.   Of course most of the ones working were 

17  handicapped.

18      Q.   I get that.  So let me ask you a couple more 

19  questions, but we're almost done.  Okay?  I know you said 

20  that you had been stopped at a stop sign on Weller Drive; 

21  right?

22      A.   I stopped and waited.

23      Q.   Before you turned left on to Perry Highway?

24      A.   Yes.

25      Q.   So how fast do you think your car was going at 


                                                               19

 1  the time of the impact?

 2      A.   I guess about -- I was just pulling out.  I 

 3  guess I was going about two or three miles.

 4      Q.   And there is just a stop sign for you.  Is there 

 5  any type of sign or light for traffic that's on Perry 

 6  Highway?

 7      A.   No.  It just had the stop sign coming out of the 

 8  one street where I was coming out of.

 9           MS. CORBETT:  I don't have anymore questions for 

10  you, Mr. Cecchino.  Your attorney may want to ask you 

11  some. 

12           MR. CROUMER:  I don't have any questions right 

13  now.  

14           MS. CORBETT:  Did you want to waive or read?

15           MR. CROUMER:  We'll read. 

16           (Signature not waived.)

17           (Whereupon, the above-entitled matter was 

18  concluded at 1:16 p.m. this date.)

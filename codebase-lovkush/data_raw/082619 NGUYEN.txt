          18   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          19   Q.     Good afternoon, gentleman.  If it's

          20   okay with everybody, I'm going to give

          21   everybody instructions now.  That way it will

          22   cut our time a little bit.

          23          First and foremost, make sure you

          24   understand all of the questions that I or any

                                                            6



           1   of the attorneys are about to ask you.  If

           2   you don't understand a question, let me know.

           3   I'll be happy to rephrase it or change it so

           4   you understand the question.

           5          The interpreter cannot have a

           6   conversation with you.  He can only interpret

           7   what you say and what I say.  If you need

           8   clarification, just say that you need

           9   clarification and I will clarify the

          10   question.

          11          If you simply answer the question, I'm

          12   going to assume and the record is going to

          13   reflect a few things; first, that you heard

          14   the entire question; second, that you

          15   understood the entire question; third, that

          16   you gave an honest answer to that question.

          17          You need to answer all the questions

          18   with an actual word.  Shaking your head or

          19   shrugging your shoulders cannot be

          20   interpreted by the interpreter.

          21          If you don't remember something, tell

          22   me you don't remember.  If you don't know

          23   something, tell me you don't know.  If you

          24   can estimate something, like time, distance

                                                            7



           1   or speed, go ahead and do that.  Just let us

           2   know that you're estimating.

           3          Have you understood all of those

           4   instructions Mr. Nguyen?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Have you understood all of those

           7   instructions Mr. Pham?

           8   A.     I do.

           9   Q.     Have you understood all those

          10   instructions Mr. Vu?

          11   A.     I do.

          12   Q.     You two are off the hot seat for a

          13   minute.

          14          Mr. Nguyen, do you understand any

          15   English?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     Do you speak any English?

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     Before coming in here today, did you

          20   review any documents or paperwork?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     As you sit here today, did you take

          23   any medication for anything?

          12   Q.     When was that?

          14   Q.     Can you tell me about approximately

          15   how many years ago?

          16   A.     Right after the accident happened.

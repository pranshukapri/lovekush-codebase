          11   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          12   Q.     Can you please state your full name for the record.

          13   A.     Sherrilyn Lee Hensley.

          14   Q.     Have you ever been known by any other names --

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.      -- like a maiden name?

          17   A.     I'm also known by Sherry Hensley.  My maiden name

          18   was Troy.  I was known as Sherrilyn Lee Troy or Sherry

          19   Troy.  I've been known as Sherrilyn Hensley-Green, Hensley

          20   dash Green, but that's not a legal name.

          21   Q.     Have you ever had your deposition taken before?

          22   A.     Yes, not as a -- but as a witness.

          23   Q.     What were you a witness to?

          24   A.     A person slipped on an ice cream at a mall in

          25   Northern California, back in -- I think, in the early '80s
                                                                      5



           1   at some point.  I don't know.

           2   Q.     And you were a witness to that incident?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     And did you -- I'm assuming you gave your

           5   information to that individual, and then they requested

           6   your deposition?

           7   A.     I -- I walked up to the -- it was a lot of people

           8   there that day.  I walked up to the counter and I said --

           9   I -- as I was walking up, the -- the woman slipped.

          10                  The woman that her daughter dropped the ice

          11   cream said, "Oh, dear.  Wait.  Oh.  Walk away," and didn't

          12   do anything.  So I was gonna go up to the counter and say,

          13   "Hey.  You've got some ice cream down here."  And before I

          14   could do that, the woman slipped.  So I gave that to

          15   the...

          16   Q.     Other than that deposition, have you ever had any

          17   other type of a deposition before?

          18   A.     I don't think so.

          19   Q.     So since it's been some time since you've had that

          20   one, I'd like to juts give you a few refreshers on the

          21   record.

          22                  The first thing I would ask -- and you're

          23   already doing a great job of it -- is just for your

          24   patience in allowing me to finish asking my full question

          25   before you start answering.  As you can see, there's a
                                                                      6



           1   court reporter in the room with us who takes down

           2   everything that's said out loud, so if you and I start

           3   talking over one another, we're not gonna understand each

           4   other, and we're not gonna understand the record when we

           5   read it back later.  Is that fair?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     I would also ask for a verbal answer to all of your

           8   (sic) questions.  I'm sitting directly across from you

           9   today, so I can see if you nod your head, shake your head,

          10   or point to a part of your body; but unless you say those

          11   words out loud, it won't make it over to our record.

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     So if you hear me say, "Is that a 'yes'?" I'm not

          14   trying to be rude.  I'm just making sure that what you're

          15   showing me is making it over to our record.

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Try to avoid words like "uh-huh," "mm-hmm,"

          18   "uh-uh."  We also don't understand if that's a "yes" or a

          19   "no" or what that means when we read it back later.  So if

          20   it's a "yes," I would ask for a "yes."  If it's a "no," a

          21   "no."

          22                  And as your attorney probably already told

          23   you, we don't want you to guess on the record, so "I don't

          24   know" is a perfectly acceptable answer if you do not know

          25   the answer, okay?
                                                                      7



           1   A.     I understand.

           2   Q.     If it's something you're able to estimate, usually

           3   time or distance, please just let me know that you're

           4   estimating before you give me the answer, okay?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     If you need to take a break at any time, I would

           7   just ask that you finish answering the question that's on

           8   the record before you step outside with your attorney.  Is

           9   that fair?

          10   A.     I understand.

          11   Q.     Are you under the influence of any drugs, alcohol,

          12   or medication today that might affect your ability to

          13   understand what's going on?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     What is your date of birth?

          16   A.     September 26th, 1948.

          17   Q.     And where do you live?

          18   A.     18 Oakland Road, West Chester, Pennsylvania, 19382.

          19   Q.     How long have you lived at that address?

          20   A.     Since February of 2009, so 10 and a half years.

          21   Q.     Fair to say that you were living at that address on

          22   the date of the accident --

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     -- that we're here for today?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                      8



           1   Q.     And when I talk about the date of the accident, I'm

           2   referring to March 3rd of 2017.

           3   A.     Yeah.

           4   Q.     Do you agree with that date?

           5   A.     I agree.

           6   Q.     When I say "the accident," I'm referring to that

           7   date, okay?  And I have that the accident happened at the

           8   intersection of 202 and Oakland Road.  Is that fair?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     At the time of the accident, who, if anyone, did

          11   you live with at the Oakland Road address?

          12   A.     My husband, Roy Green.

          13   Q.     Anyone besides Roy?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     Currently, who, if anyone, do you live with at that

          16   address?

          17   A.     Same.

          18   Q.     At the time of the accident, did you own a car?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     What type of a car?

          21   A.     Hyundai Tucson.  I forgot the year.

          22   Q.     Is that the car that you were driving on the date

          23   of the accident?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     What color was that car?
                                                                      9



           1   A.     Dark blue, I think.  Is it all right if I say "I

           2   think"?

           3   Q.     If you're estimating.  If it's -- if you know that

           4   it's a darker color.  We don't want you to guess, so if

           5   you totally don't know and you're just guessing dark blue.

           6   But if you believe it was a darker-color vehicle, then

           7   that's perfectly acceptable.  It's whatever you're

           8   comfortable with.

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     And I'll -- we'll note that you're not positive

          11   that it was dark blue, but it was dark -- a dark car.

          12   A.     I -- yes, dark blue.  I just don't know the name of

          13   the color.

          14   Q.     Yeah.  They always have funny names for everything.

          15   Did you have insurance on that vehicle?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Who was that insurance with?

          18   A.     Travelers --

          19   Q.     And do you know if --

          20   A.     -- through -- through an agency.

          21   Q.     Do you know if you selected the full tort or the --

          22   A.     Yes, full tort.

          23   Q.     -- limited tort option?  Just give me that extra

          24   pause.

          25                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yeah.  Wait -- wait for
                                                                     10



           1   her -- no.  No.  No.  You're not in any trouble.

           2                  MS. BARBETTA:  You're good.  You're not in

           3   trouble.  I promise.  You don't get a demerit or anything.

           4                  MR. GORODETZER:  No.  No demerits.  Just a

           5   reminder.  That's all.

           6                  MS. BARBETTA:  Yup.

           7   BY MS. BARBETTA:

           8   Q.     And you're a hundred percent -- for all of these

           9   questions, you're gonna totally anticipate exactly where

          10   my question is gonna go, but just in case, just give me

          11   that extra pause.  And I might change my mind and change

          12   the question, so you don't want to give an answer to

          13   something that you don't know the full question for, okay?

          14   A.     I apologize.

          15   Q.     No.  You're fine.  We do it all the time.  Trust

          16   me.  Even attorneys get yelled at for it all the time.

          17                  MR. GORODETZER:  I only get yelled at for

          18   talking too fast.

          19                  MS. BARBETTA:  That too.

          20                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          21   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          22   Q.     At the time of the accident, were you employed?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     Who were you employed with?

          25   A.     Heartland Hospice in Chadds Ford.
                                                                     11



           1   Q.     And what did you do for them at the time of the

           2   accident?

           3   A.     I was a team coordinator.

           4   Q.     Could you just describe what that entails.

           5   A.     Basically, we took care of the administrative

           6   processes, et cetera, for the nurses, health aides, et

           7   cetera.  There were time reports.  They would turn them in

           8   and then we would enter them.  We received the paperwork

           9   on any kind of new patient.  Any kind of paperwork, we

          10   processed it, among other things.

          11   Q.     Did you sit down for the majority of your day when

          12   you had that job, or were you up and moving and --

          13   A.     Up and moving.

          14   Q.     Did you ever interact with any patients?

          15   A.     Only when they called on the phone.

          16   Q.     How many hours a week were you working at Heartland

          17   Hospice right before the date of the accident?

          18   A.     Supposed to work 40.  I usually worked about 45 or

          19   more.

          20   Q.     Are you still employed there?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     When did you stop working there?

          23   A.     Estimate, termination date was late March.  After

          24   the accident, I didn't work for several weeks, went back

          25   for a couple in part-time to help out, but it was near
                                                                     12



           1   impossible for me.  I did it, but I was gonna have to

           2   stop.

           3   Q.     Near impossible because of what reason?

           4   A.     Inability to concentrate, to focus, feeling spacey.

           5   I can't think of the words.  That's unfortunate.  I used

           6   to be very glib, great command of the English language.

           7   No more.  Difficulty with the paperwork.  I did it but the

           8   stress was intense.  Barely.

           9   Q.     Prior to the date of the accident -- I know you

          10   were saying that you were working 40 to 45 hours a week --

          11   did you get paid a salary or an hourly wage there?

          12   A.     Hourly, but I only put in 40 hours.  The rest was

          13   because I was the kind of person, if the work needed to be

          14   done -- because in a hospice, it's very demanding, and the

          15   patients are primary, I would stay and do it.

          16   Q.     Would you not get paid any type of overtime for

          17   those hours?

          18   A.     Sometimes, they would give me comp time like an

          19   extra day or leaving early.  Usually, I never said

          20   anything.

          21   Q.     But when you would -- would you personally have to

          22   log your hours each week in some type of a system?

          23   A.     Yeah.  We -- we had a -- a sheet of paper that --

          24   you know, a form that we filled out and gave it to the

          25   office manager.
                                                                     13



           1   Q.     And who was the office manager at the time of the

           2   accident?

           3   A.     At the time, Martha Anderson.  She's no longer

           4   there.

           5   Q.     Was she employed there up until when you left that

           6   job?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     And what was the hourly rate that you had at the

           9   time of the accident?

          10   A.     $18.

          11   Q.     How long had you worked at Heartland Hospice prior

          12   to the date of the accident?

          13   A.     Let me think.  Is it okay to pause?

          14   Q.     It's totally fine.  Take your time.  There's no

          15   time limit at all.

          16   A.     I believe I started in October of 2015.

          17   Q.     You indicated that, after the accident, you missed

          18   several weeks.

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Did you ever -- immediately after the accident, did

          21   you ever go back to work, or did you call out or ask to be

          22   off?

          23   A.     Immediately after the accident, I called Martha and

          24   left a message and then spoke to them Monday morning about

          25   the accident.
                                                                     14



           1   Q.     Did you have any type of paid sick leave at that

           2   position?

           3   A.     I believe -- I'm not sure.  Yes, I believe I did.

           4   Q.     Do you recall using any of that sick time for the

           5   time that you missed after the accident?

           6   A.     If I had sick time, I would have used it, yes.

           7   Q.     And your sick time, did that roll over each year,

           8   or was it use-it-or-lose-it time, meaning did you have to

           9   use it within a given year, or would it transition over

          10   and you could tag that on to the -- to the next year?

          11   A.     I don't remember.

          12   Q.     Did you have vacation time that you were given with

          13   that position?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     How much vacation time did you receive?

          16   A.     I am not sure.  Approximate, two weeks per year.

          17   Q.     Do you recall if that vacation time carried over

          18   into the new year or if you had to use it within the given

          19   year?

          20   A.     Do not recall.

          21   Q.     Do you recall using any vacation time for the time

          22   you took off after the accident?

          23   A.     If I had any, they would have used it.  I continued

          24   getting paid, so I believe yes.

          25   Q.     Did you continue getting paid until you went
                                                                     15



           1   back -- when you went back on a part-time basis, or was

           2   there any time period where you were not paid at all when

           3   you took off?

           4   A.     I was paid until I went back.

           5   Q.     And were you paid your full -- your usual, full

           6   salary during that time period?

           7   A.     That I was off?

           8   Q.     When you were off, prior to going back part-time.

           9   A.     I believe so.

          10   Q.     Did you have any separate personal time that you

          11   were given with that position, that you recall?

          12   A.     There was one personal day, but I believe I had

          13   already taken it.

          14   Q.     And was Martha Anderson the person you contacted in

          15   order to -- to take off for the period of time that you

          16   took off?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Do you recall how many weeks exactly you took off

          19   completely after the accident, before going back

          20   full-time?  Or part-time, rather.

          21   A.     No.  It may have been -- no, I don't.  Two to three

          22   weeks.  They only gave me one thing to do when I came

          23   back, which was to help enter the hourly -- the hours for

          24   the employees.  And even that, I was -- my vision was not

          25   good and my brain was cloudy.
                                                                     16



           1   Q.     When you went back after the two- or three-week

           2   period of time, how many hours a week were you working

           3   when you returned?

           4   A.     Ten.

           5   Q.     And were you still making the $18 an hour for those

           6   10 hours?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     What was the reason that you only went back 10

           9   hours and not to the full 40 hours that you were working

          10   before?

          11   A.     They hired someone in my position.  And -- and I

          12   was going -- I gave my notice because I couldn't do the

          13   job.

          14   Q.     When did you -- did you give your notice before you

          15   went back to the part-time basis or --

          16   A.     I had given my notice a week before the accident,

          17   because I needed a change.  I gave a month's notice to

          18   allow training of a new person, and I was going to work

          19   less hours at higher pay -- or at the same or higher.

          20   Q.     Were you going to have a new position at the

          21   same --

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.      -- job or a different --

          24   A.     I was going to leave the office.

          25   Q.     And where were you going to?
                                                                     17



           1   A.     I had several prospects, but I didn't -- I hadn't

           2   decided.

           3   Q.     What was the reason that a month -- a week before

           4   the accident that you gave your notice to Heartland

           5   Hospice?

           6   A.     That I wanted to work less hours.  Basically, I

           7   wanted to work 40 instead of -- I mean the situation in

           8   the office had changed from when I first went there.  I

           9   wanted to work about 30 hours to -- 30 to 35 hours instead

          10   of 40, and they didn't have a position for that time

          11   frame.

          12   Q.     Who did you give your notice to the week before the

          13   accident?

          14   A.     Martha Anderson.

          15   Q.     And you said, "Martha does not work there anymore"?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     Do you know where Martha is?

          18   A.     I do not.

          19   Q.     Do you know the individual who took over Martha's

          20   position, who that person is?

          21   A.     No, I do not.

          22                  MS. BARBETTA:  Are you making a formal wage

          23   loss or loss of earning capacity claim?

          24                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yes.

          25   BY MS. BARBETTA:
                                                                     18



           1   Q.     What was the date that you were set to leave the

           2   position at Heartland Hospice?

           3   A.     I don't have the letter on me.  I believe it was

           4   about March 24th.

           5   Q.     Of 2017?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Do you have a letter from the employer, indicating

           8   that to be your last date?

           9   A.     I have a letter that I sent to the employer.

          10                  MS. BARBETTA:  I'll request a copy of that

          11   letter.

          12                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.

          13                  MR. GORODETZER:  If she still has it.  I

          14   don't think --

          15                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't

          16   know if I still have it.

          17                  MS. BARBETTA:  Okay.

          18                  THE WITNESS:  But I -- I will look.  I -- I

          19   don't know.

          20                  MR. GORODETZER:  That's fine.

          21                  THE WITNESS:  It's been too long.

          22   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          23   Q.     Prior to the date of the accident, were you having

          24   any type of an inability to concentrate or focus at work?

          25   A.     No.
                                                                     19



           1   Q.     Did you have any difficulty cognitively doing that

           2   position at all?

           3   A.     Not at all.

           4                  May I add something?  My strengths

           5   throughout my career were problem-solving, multitasking,

           6   attention to detail, and being extremely thorough and

           7   accurate.  I had no problems doing any of those things,

           8   and I was hired because I could do that.

           9                  After the accident and since, I have not

          10   been able to do that.  I can function certain days, and

          11   other days, I don't.

          12   Q.     And when you gave your notice a week before the

          13   accident, you indicated that you had various job

          14   prospects.  Did you have any formal offers --

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     Did you have any --

          17   A.     At that time, I was -- I'm sorry.

          18   Q.     It's okay.

          19   A.     I did it again.

          20   Q.     It's all right.

          21   A.     At that time, I had enough saved up to take some

          22   time off and decide which company I was gonna go with.

          23   Q.     Did you have any idea how long of a period of time

          24   you wanted to take off?

          25   A.     Just a few weeks.
                                                                     20



           1   Q.     And these positions that you had applied, did you

           2   send in a formal application to these locations, or were

           3   they just companies that you were aware were hiring?

           4   A.     I had two that I had agencies that I had worked

           5   with before that had said:  When I was available, please

           6   let them know.  And so I -- I get -- would get emails of

           7   jobs available from them regularly.  And there were a

           8   couple out there.  And I had another couple companies that

           9   I had worked with, that I was going to put a formal

          10   application in with, that had been sorry that I left.

          11   Q.     What are the names of those two agencies that told

          12   you to let them know when you were available?

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     If you don't know now, you can tell your attorney,

          15   and he can tell me later.

          16                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yeah.  Typically, what

          17   happens is:  If there's something that crops up during a

          18   deposition that we need to come back and circle back to

          19   after the deposition, she'll, when she gets the transcript

          20   and reads through and makes little check marks next to the

          21   things she's asking for and looks through her notes, and

          22   she'll send me a letter saying, "These are all the things

          23   I need from the deposition."  And I'll relay that to you,

          24   and you can get me the stuff if it's available.

          25                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I -- I can't --
                                                                     21



           1                  MR. GORODETZER:  So don't -- don't -- if

           2   you remember now, that's great.  If you remember -- one of

           3   the instructions she didn't give you is:  If at some point

           4   during the deposition, you all of a sudden remember the

           5   names of the agency and you go, "Eureka," you can stop and

           6   say, "Hey.  May I supplement my prior answer?"

           7                  If you don't remember today, that's okay

           8   too.  You can go find the answer after the deposition, and

           9   we'll --

          10                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I -- I know where

          11   they're located.  I just can't remember the name right

          12   now.

          13   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          14   Q.     You indicated that, when you went back to work at

          15   Heartland Hospice, you went back for about ten hours a

          16   week; is that correct?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     And when you went back after that two- or

          19   three-week period of time of not working there, they had

          20   already hired somebody to fill your full-time position; is

          21   that correct?

          22   A.     Uh-huh.

          23   Q.     Is that a "yes"?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25                  I could have changed my mind in that time
                                                                     22



           1   period that I gave -- like the first -- when I first gave

           2   the notice, I could have changed my mind.  I wasn't being

           3   -- I wasn't being let go.  It was my decision.  So I could

           4   have, but I wanted a change of stress level, for one

           5   thing.  Hospice is a very difficult industry.

           6   Q.     How long of a period of time did you work

           7   approximately ten hours a week before formally leaving --

           8   A.     Two weeks.

           9   Q.     -- the employment?  And was your last date of the

          10   employment the date that you had initially indicated to

          11   Heartland Hospice of the March 24th -- or somewhere around

          12   that -- of 2017?

          13   A.     I will have to find that out.  They left me on --

          14   they didn't give me a formal termination date at that

          15   time.  They left it open in case they would use me again.

          16   I wouldn't have been able to go back, so I didn't get to

          17   tell them, "I can't come back, 'cause I can't work."

          18                  I knew at the time it was two weeks, and I

          19   was surprised when they gave me a termination date, 'cause

          20   I thought that was it.  But I do have that.  I believe I

          21   can find that for you, and I'll --

          22   Q.     So they gave you -- they gave you a formal

          23   termination date once you returned on a part-time basis

          24   after the accident?

          25   A.     The part-time, yes, because they had terminated me
                                                                     23



           1   because of the accident, instead of me going to...

           2   Q.     So what was the reason that they terminated you --

           3   A.     Didn't need me.

           4   Q.     -- for the accident?  But that was after you had

           5   already given your notice?

           6   A.     Oh, yeah.  I mean I didn't even know that I needed

           7   that.  I had only gone back for that two weeks, so I was

           8   surprised.

           9   Q.     When you went back for the two-week period of time

          10   when you were working approximately ten hours, I believe

          11   you indicated that they only had you doing the one job of

          12   inputting the time?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Could you describe for me what, if any,

          15   difficulties you were having during that two-week period

          16   of time before your formal date that you left that

          17   employment.

          18                  MR. GORODETZER:  Objection to the form.

          19                  If you understand, you can answer.

          20                  THE WITNESS:  I don't understand.

          21   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          22   Q.     I'll rephrase it.  For the two-week period of time

          23   that you were back working part-time at Heartland, could

          24   you just describe for me any type of difficulties you were

          25   having doing that position for -- even on a part-time
                                                                     24



           1   basis.

           2   A.     Okay.  I was having vision trouble.  I had pain in

           3   my head and pressure.  I had problems concentrating.  I

           4   had to keep looking back at the work to try to figure out

           5   what I was doing, brain fog, many different cognitive

           6   problems making it difficult for me to -- to do it.

           7                  Previous to the accident, I didn't have to

           8   keep going back and relooking at -- at the time to figure

           9   out if I did it right.  And in those two weeks, I had to

          10   keep looking at it and reworking it.

          11   Q.     Did you tell anyone at your position that you were

          12   having these difficulties?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Who did you tell?

          15   A.     Martha.

          16   Q.     And what, if anything, did Martha say?

          17   A.     Well, I said to her -- because my personalty is a

          18   tenacious, never-giving-up personality, I was determined

          19   to help until the person started.  As the saying goes, I

          20   sucked it up and tried to be a soldier and get through it,

          21   because they did have someone coming in.

          22                  So even though I was having some

          23   difficulty, I kept telling them, "Okay.  I'll do it,"

          24   knowing that when I got home at night, I'd crash.  But

          25   after the two weeks, I realized that wasn't gonna continue
                                                                     25



           1   anyway.

           2   Q.     And that was because of the letter that you

           3   received from them or because --

           4   A.     I didn't get the letter until months later.

           5   Q.     So a month after stopping at your employment there

           6   is when you received the former -- formal letter of

           7   termination?

           8   A.     Approximating.  I don't have the date, but I

           9   believe I can get it for you.

          10   Q.     On the last day that you worked there, how did you

          11   know that that was gonna be your last day, then?  Was that

          12   based on the letter that you had previously sent them,

          13   indicating your last day?

          14   A.     Martha had said when I went back those two weeks

          15   that they would just need me the two weeks, and I figured

          16   maybe I could hang in there for that amount of time.  And

          17   being the kind of person I am, I said, "Well, if you need

          18   me more..."

          19                  And I'm thinking -- as I went home, I

          20   thought:  What an idiot.  I can't do this.  But that's my

          21   personality.  I finally gave up and realized I had to give

          22   in to what I could and couldn't do.

          23   Q.     So when you went back for that two-week period of

          24   time, you knew that you were only going back for that

          25   two-week period of time?  You knew that it wasn't gonna
                                                                     26



           1   continue on any further than that?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     Did you get any type of performance evaluations at

           4   your -- at that position --

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     -- where they evaluate you?  And who would be in

           7   charge of that, Martha?

           8   A.     Martha.

           9   Q.     And during the performance evaluation, did you

          10   have -- ever have any complaints about your cognitive

          11   abilities, ability to concentrate, do your work?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Did you ever miss any long periods of time, prior

          14   to the date of the accident, from that employment for any

          15   issues with your memory, your --

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.      -- brain, head, anything like that?

          18   A.     Sorry.  I did it again.  I apologize.

          19   Q.     After leaving Heartland Hospice, when, if ever,

          20   were you employed again since the accident?

          21   A.     Not.

          22   Q.     So you've not had any position since the date of

          23   the accident?

          24   A.     No.  I applied recently -- let me back up.  The

          25   neurologist and my primary care doctor that I was seeing
                                                                     27



           1   knew I wanted to get back to work, but they also knew that

           2   I wasn't ready, because of the problems I was having.  I

           3   tried applying recently to a pizza place.  I thought:

           4   Maybe.  But when she gave me -- I applied.  I didn't get

           5   the job.

           6                  I was actually glad I didn't, because I

           7   would have had to remember orders, 'cause it would have

           8   been taking orders.  And I would have had to remember --

           9   to ask them a lot of questions.  And I realized that some

          10   days, I could; and other days, I wouldn't be able to.  So

          11   I have to try to find something else.

          12   Q.     What was the pizza place that you applied to?

          13   A.     Pizza Peddler in West Chester.

          14   Q.     And when did you apply there?

          15   A.     Approximately, three months ago.

          16   Q.     Did either the neurologist that you were seeing or

          17   your primary care doctor have to give any type of

          18   paperwork to Heartland Hospice indicating any issues

          19   cognitively that you were having with them?

          20   A.     I do not know.

          21   Q.     Did any of your treating doctors tell you that you

          22   were unable to work --

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     -- for any time period?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     28



           1   Q.     Who was that?

           2   A.     The neurologist and the primary care.  Neurologist,

           3   Dr. Geiger, G-E-I-G-E-R, in Paoli and Exton, and Dr. Carol

           4   Glessner, G-L-E-S-S-N-E-R, in Exton.

           5   Q.     And what practice is Dr. Glessner based out of?

           6   What's the name of the --

           7   A.     Main Line Health.

           8   Q.     How long has Dr. Glessner been your primary care

           9   doctor?

          10   A.     Four years -- or five.  I'm not sure.  I have a lot

          11   of problem with dates.

          12   Q.     Other than applying to the Pizza Peddler three

          13   months ago, did you send out any other applications from

          14   the date of the accident until today's date?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     And what's the reason for that?

          17   A.     I wasn't able to -- let me clarify.  I couldn't

          18   figure out what kind of job I would be able to do.  I have

          19   lost my confidence in being able to do anything.  Because

          20   I had such a problem with cognitive functions, especially

          21   memory, I knew I couldn't do certain office jobs.

          22                  I had concerns about being a receptionist,

          23   because I'd have to remember things.  I thought about

          24   retail, but there, again, you had to know all these

          25   things.  And I couldn't do it.  I still can't, but I'm
                                                                     29



           1   gonna try one of these days anyway.

           2   Q.     Prior to working at Heartland Hospice, where did

           3   you work before that?

           4   A.     Securitas Global Solutions, I think.

           5   Q.     Global Solutions?

           6   A.     I think it's Global Solutions.  They're in King of

           7   Prussia.

           8   Q.     And what did you do for them?

           9   A.     I was the office person.

          10   Q.     And how long did you work there?

          11   A.     About nine months.

          12   Q.     Did you go right from Securitas --

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.      -- to Heartland?  Just give me that extra pause.

          15                  MR. GORODETZER:  It's all good.

          16   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          17   Q.     Where did you work before Securitas?

          18   A.     I hate -- I hate when I can't remember.  I'm not

          19   sure the last job before Securitas.  I will have to find

          20   out.

          21   Q.     For Securitas, were you paid an hourly salary or a

          22   salary -- hourly wage or a salary?

          23   A.     Hourly wage.

          24   Q.     And how much were you making there an hour?

          25   A.     I think 18.
                                                                     30



           1   Q.     Did you file tax returns in 2016?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And have you filed tax returns each year since

           4   then?

           5   A.     Oh, yes.  I can look on those.

           6                  MR. GORODETZER:  They've been provided.

           7                  MS. BARBETTA:  I actually don't have them

           8   in my -- you indicated that they were provided, but they

           9   weren't in my packet.

          10                  MR. GORODETZER:  Hold on.  Let me look at

          11   the link real fast, 'cause they should be.  Bear with me.

          12   I'll show you.

          13                  MS. BARBETTA:  Okay.  Yeah.  They're not in

          14   here.  I have the medicals.

          15                  MR. GORODETZER:  They would be towards the

          16   end of the document.  I apologize if they somehow did not

          17   make it in.  And I believe, in -- in fairness, I think you

          18   sent them back to me as part of your discovery.

          19                  MS. BARBETTA:  Really?

          20                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yeah, 'cause they -- they

          21   were part of the original packet.  I think I remember

          22   scrolling through them.

          23                  MS. BARBETTA:  We can talk about it off

          24   record.  I mean --

          25                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yeah.
                                                                     31



           1                  MS. BARBETTA:  -- after the deposition.

           2   BY MS. BARBETTA:

           3   Q.     All right.  Have you applied for any type of Social

           4   Security benefits or Social Security Disability benefits

           5   since leaving your position at Heartland?

           6   A.     No.  I was already on Social Security as of 2013 or

           7   '14.

           8   Q.     Being on Social Security, were there any limits on

           9   the amount of hours that you were able to work?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     And what -- do you recall what those limits were?

          12   A.     No.  I was under the limit each year.  My tax

          13   returns would show that.

          14                  MR. GORODETZER:  So just off the record for

          15   a second.

          16                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          17   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          18   Q.     Had you been consistently working approximately 40

          19   hours a week since starting the Social Security, so since

          20   like 2013, 2014 area, or were there time periods where you

          21   would be unemployed and then start working again?

          22   A.     There were time periods when I would be unemployed

          23   and start working again.  I was a contract worker for

          24   various agencies for a while.  It's harder, when you turn

          25   65, to get a job permanently, trust me, even if you're
                                                                     32



           1   very qualified.

           2   Q.     So in being a contract worker, would they hire you

           3   for part-time positions -- or part-time time periods,

           4   rather, whenever you were needed?

           5   A.     Full-time, but part-time time periods.

           6   Q.     Full-time hours but for part-time -- part of the

           7   year?

           8   A.     Yeah.

           9   Q.     We got that there -- we got there together.

          10   A.     I had -- one job in particular, I went while the

          11   girl had surgery.  She was gonna be out for a couple

          12   months at least.  It was hip surgery.

          13                  And I was working for a high-level EVP in a

          14   particular company, and his -- in the particular group.

          15   And he just kept saying how much he wished I could stay.

          16   I was -- I became their right-hand person very quickly.

          17   But she came back.  And the job they did have to offer me

          18   was way over in -- it was Limerick or somewhere.  It was

          19   way far away from where I live, so I couldn't take it.

          20   Q.     Do you know the name of the agencies that you

          21   worked for that would give you these contract positions?

          22   A.     They'll be on my tax returns.

          23   Q.     Okay.

          24   A.     What I will do for you and my attorney:  I will

          25   try, on a day when I can think clearly, to put together
                                                                     33



           1   the agency names.  Because on the W-2s, you'll have an

           2   agency name.  It won't necessarily tell you the contract.

           3   And I'll try to put together the two.

           4                  Is that something you want?

           5   Q.     We'll talk out what we need after, but I appreciate

           6   that.

           7                  Has your neurologist or primary care doctor

           8   indicated when they believe you'd be able to -- to work

           9   again?  Have you had any conversations with them about

          10   that?

          11   A.     He -- the last one I had with the neurologist, I'm

          12   overdue to see him, as a matter of fact.  We were hoping I

          13   would get to be able to work fairly soon.  But I

          14   haven't -- I'm still -- I have good days and bad days, as

          15   my husband will attest to, days when he doesn't let me go

          16   into the kitchen.  He just tells me, "Sit down."

          17   Q.     At the time of the accident, did you have a

          18   driver's license?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     And what state was that license for?

          21   A.     Pennsylvania.

          22   Q.     Did you have any restrictions on that license?

          23   Typically, a restriction is having to wear contacts or

          24   glasses when you drive.

          25   A.     Glasses, and I had them on that night.
                                                                     34



           1   Q.     Do you need to use them to see far away or close up

           2   or a combination of both?

           3   A.     I had progressive lenses, both.  Since then, I've

           4   had cataract surgery.  I do not need them anymore.

           5   Q.     When did you have that surgery?

           6   A.     This February.

           7   Q.     February, 2019?

           8   A.     Uh-huh.

           9   Q.     I heard that it's a big game changer.

          10   A.     Uh-huh.  I mean yes.

          11   Q.     It's okay.

          12                  MR. GORODETZER:  Off the record.

          13                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          14                  THE WITNESS:  I want it known:  At the time

          15   of the accident, I did not have cataract problems.  I have

          16   always seen my vision specialist every year because I had

          17   a lens -- I can't remember what you call it, but I had a

          18   viscus fluid do something.  So I get checked every so

          19   often.  My vision was fine.

          20                  After the accident, I was checked because I

          21   was having vision trouble.  And I was having pain in my

          22   eye and pain in the back of my head, which I still get.

          23   And he examined me and I was fine.  Somehow, they have

          24   come on since, in the past year.  Because even up to a

          25   year ago or a year and a half ago, they were -- they were
                                                                     35



           1   fine.

           2                  And all of a sudden, this past January,

           3   when I went to see the vision specialist because I had the

           4   viscus fluid start messing up in the other eye, he said,

           5   "Oh.  And you have cataracts."  I said, "Huh?"  So it

           6   isn't something I had at the time.  It was never diagnosed

           7   until this past year, just FYI.

           8   BY MS. BARBETTA:

           9   Q.     Who is the vision specialist that you see?

          10   A.     They're called Clompus, C-O -- C-L-O-M-P-U-S, Reto,

          11   R-E-T-O, and Halscheid, H-A-L-S-H-I-E-D (sic).

          12   Q.     And where are they located?

          13   A.     In -- no.  I'm thinking.  I'm sorry.  Is it Goshen

          14   or West Chester?  It's on Boot Road in -- I don't know if

          15   it's called West Chester or Goshen, but --

          16   Q.     Okay.  And is that who you saw after the accident

          17   as well?

          18   A.     Yes.  And then I got a second opinion at Chester

          19   County Eye in Exton because they said, "Oh.  Your eyes are

          20   fine."  I said, "No.  I'm not doing well."  And I got a

          21   second opinion.  And they said, "We don't see it," so they

          22   said, "It must be neurological."

          23   Q.     Has your driver's license ever been suspended or

          24   revoked?

          25   A.     No.  No tickets.  No -- I mean...
                                                                     36



           1   Q.     Have you continued to drive since the date of the

           2   accident?

           3   A.     I did not drive for the first month -- no, the

           4   first six weeks, I believe, approximately.  I only drive

           5   when cognitively, I'm there.  If I'm having a bad day, I

           6   have my husband drive.  I'm a very careful driver.

           7   Q.     Did any of your doctors indicate that you were

           8   unable to drive for any time period after the accident?

           9   A.     The neurologist, at the time of the accident, not

          10   right after, mentioned that I would need to wait until I

          11   could -- until I was able to drive safely.

          12   Q.     How did you find out about that neurologist?

          13   A.     My primary care doctor.  I went to see her Monday

          14   after the accident.  She referred me to Dr. Geiger and the

          15   orthopedic doctor because my back was not in good shape.

          16   Q.     As a result of the accident that we're here for

          17   today, could you please list for me all of the part or

          18   parts of your body that you're claiming injury to, so from

          19   the date of the accident until today.

          20   A.     Date of the accident, my back, my neck, and my

          21   head.  I believe my shoulder was painful.  I got therapy

          22   for my back and my neck, actually.  My back is fine.  It

          23   healed fine.

          24                  My -- I still have trouble with my neck and

          25   my head.  But the -- they did therapy for a particular
                                                                     37



           1   amount of time.  And I still see the neurologist for my

           2   concussion.

           3   Q.     Do you recall if he diagnosed you with a concussion

           4   or if another doctor did?

           5   A.     When I was in emergency, I was having trouble

           6   breathing after the accident.  The airbag in the passenger

           7   window deployed, and when -- I ended up this way on the

           8   seat when it finally came -- the car finally came to rest.

           9   Apparently, the -- what they decided later was that the

          10   dust from the airbag caused me to have problems breathing.

          11                  They took me to the trauma center at

          12   Riddle.  Worst experience of my life.

          13   Q.     Who's "they"?  The ambulance people took you there?

          14   A.     Yes, because I was having trouble breathing, so

          15   they decided to take me to a trauma center.

          16   Q.     Why was it the worst experience?  It could be a lot

          17   of reasons.  That -- I know that hospital, so there could

          18   be a lot of reasons, so I understand.

          19   A.     I laid there for over a half hour.  The IV thing

          20   had come out of my arm, and the -- it was profusely

          21   coming -- the blood was coming out for over a half hour.

          22   I couldn't figure out why I was so wet, because they had a

          23   cone thing on me so I wouldn't move.  They just had me

          24   laying there on the gurney for well over a half hour

          25   before they decided to come back in.
                                                                     38



           1                  And the nurse said, "Oh.  Oh, we have to

           2   clean you up."  And I said, "Why?"  And she says, "Oh,

           3   there's a little bit of blood."  I said, "Let me see it."

           4   She -- she tried to -- I said, "No.  You let me see it."

           5   This blanket was just full of blood, full.

           6   Q.     From the IV?

           7   A.     Yeah.  Yeah.  It was not good.  But the worst of it

           8   was:  All night long, when they finally put me in a room,

           9   they kept saying, "The thermometer is broken.  It's not

          10   registering."  And they'd bring another one.  And they'd

          11   bring another one.  And they'd bring another one.

          12                  And they said, "Oh.  The blood pressure

          13   thing isn't working" -- you know, "cup isn't working.  We

          14   have to get you another one."  And then, another one.  My

          15   temperature was way below normal, way down.  My blood

          16   pressure, as an example, went from -- to 60 over 35.

          17                  And they kept saying, "Oh.  It must be

          18   broken."  Instead of saying, "She's in shock.  We better

          19   treat her," they left me in the room and just kept --

          20   yeah.  Uh-huh.  I'm fortunate that I didn't go into

          21   anything else, because I was in shock.

          22                  The next morning, the doctor wanted me out

          23   of there.  And they didn't want to test me for anything.

          24   And I overheard the nurse -- even though I was really

          25   spaced, I overheard the nurse say to the doctor, "We have
                                                                     39



           1   to have her tested by law."  And he goes, "Oh.  Okay.  Get

           2   it done."

           3                  I just remember thinking:  How strange.

           4   I'll never forget.  Even though I don't remember a lot,

           5   that -- that, I do.

           6                  And so this guy came, and he walked me

           7   around a little, which I could hardly walk.  He goes, "Oh.

           8   That's fine."  And then, the doc said, "Okay.  She can

           9   leave."

          10                  And the woman says -- the nurse said, "But

          11   she hasn't been checked for her head injury."  And -- and

          12   he kind of grumbled and left.  And they had someone come

          13   in and check me for concussion.  And she -- she looked at

          14   my eyes and she said, "I don't even have to check you."

          15   She says, "You have a concussion."

          16                  And she just looked at me, and she -- she

          17   did some more testing.  But she says, "You really had a

          18   concussion."  And so she gave me information on it.  The

          19   doctor didn't even put it on the report when they let me

          20   go.  I -- I don't know what his problem was, but it was my

          21   worst nightmare.  It was the worst thing I could ever have

          22   happen.

          23                  Monday, I went to my primary care doctor.

          24   And she looked at me, and said, "Yes, you've had a

          25   concussion.  You need to see a neurologist."  So then, I
                                                                     40



           1   went to Dr. Geiger.

           2   Q.     Had you ever treated with Dr. Geiger prior --

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     -- to the date of the accident?

           5   A.     No.  I wasn't seeing a neurologist.

           6   Q.     Had you ever treated at Gateway Internal Medicine

           7   in --

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.      -- West Chester prior to the date of the accident?

          10   A.     Prior to the accident -- I don't know the last day

          11   I was treated there.  I switched doctors to Dr. Glessner.

          12   Q.     Did you go to Gateway for your primary care doctor?

          13   A.     Back when I went there -- I don't know the last

          14   date that I was there.

          15   Q.     But when you did go there, were they -- did they

          25   and exponentially have stayed that way.

          13   A.     No.  I had a -- what is it called? the -- the

          14   iodine radiation or whatever it is done.  And it's been

          14   about six years ago, I believe, and cracked a rib and hurt

          16   was fine.

          17   Q.     Where did you go for therapy?

          18   A.     Do not remember.

          19   Q.     Do you recall the location of it at all?

          20   A.     I'll have to look it up.  But I was fine after.  It

          21   but I don't remember.

          22   Q.     Since finishing your treatment at Premier in

          23   approximately September of 2017, have you had any other

           3   Q.     Did you ever see any type of a chiropractor after

           4   the accident?

           5   A.     No.  I need to, but my -- my car insurance wouldn't

           6   cover it, and I didn't think Medicare would.  So I'm

           7   trying to find someone that can.

           8   Q.     Had you ever treated with a chiropractor before the

           9   date of the accident?

          10   A.     Oh, about five years before that, when I cracked my

          11   rib.

          12   Q.     In the fall?  When you fell down?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     And where did you go for that?  Do you recall what

          15   chiropractor you went to?

          16   A.     I don't recall the name.

          17   Q.     Do you currently have any appointments set up for

          18   any type of chiropractic treatment?

          19   A.     No.

          20   Q.     Do you currently have any appointments set up for

          21   any more physical therapy treatment --

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.      -- for your injuries related to this accident?  Do

          25   you've had any, for your injuries related to this
                                                                     52



           1   accident?

           2   A.     No.  I do plan to pursue the pain in my head with

           3   my neurologist.

           4   Q.     When was the last time that you saw the

           5   neurologist?

           6   A.     I don't remember.

           7   Q.     Was it within 2019, within this year?

           8   A.     Yes.  Yes.

           9   Q.     How often do you see the neurologist typically?

          10   A.     I was seeing him every three months.  Now it's

          11   every six months.

          12   Q.     Other than seeing Dr. Geiger for the neurologist,

          13   did you see any other type of a neurologist or any other

          14   type of doctor for the concussion symptoms that you were

          15   having after the accident?

          16   A.     No.  I did not know that I could until this past

          17   year.

          18   Q.     How did you -- how did you find that out, that you

          19   could see --

          20   A.     I had a friend that was in an accident.  And she

          21   had a concussion and told me that she went to the

          22   concussion center.  I said:  Huh?  What?  I did not know

          23   there was such a thing.

          24   Q.     Do you have any appointments set up at that

          25   facility at all?
                                                                     53



           1   A.     It's -- it's been over two years.  I didn't think

           2   they would want to.  I'm gonna ask Dr. Geiger the next

           3   time I -- I see him.

           4   Q.     Do you have an appointment currently scheduled with

           5   Dr. Geiger?

           6   A.     I do, but I lost the date.  So I'm gonna call him

           7   tomorrow and make sure it's scheduled right away.

           8   Q.     Since stopping the treatment with the physical

           9   therapist around September of 2017, are the only doctors

          10   that you've seen since then Dr. Geiger and your primary

          21   Q.     I always just try and make sure I get all of the

          22   doctors.  Did you treat with any doctors for your injuries

           4   do for you in your meetings with him?

           5   A.     He does a few tests, asks me how I'm doing.  And I

           6   bring my husband so he can explain how I'm doing.

           7   Q.     Does your husband go with you to all of the

           8   neurology appointments?

           9   A.     Yes, most of the time.  Not every time.

          10   Q.     Did he put you -- did -- did the -- did the

          11   neurologist put you on any type of a treatment plan or

          13   cognitive issues that you were having?

          14   A.     No.  I told him I was trying to write a novel or

          15   a -- whatever.  I have lots of dreams, and I told him I

          16   was gonna try some writing to see if I could get my mind

          17   to work.  And he thought that was good.  But no,

          19   Q.     Did you ever have any type of a CT scan or a brain

          23   Q.     Did he ever discuss with you any of the results of

          24   those tests?

          25   A.     Yes.  I don't remember.
                                                                     55



           1   Q.     Prior to the date of this accident, have you ever

           2   been involved in any other type of an accident?  And I'm

           3   talking about motor vehicle, slip and fall, trip and fall,

           4   hurt at work, any other type of an accident at all.

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     When was that?

           7   A.     Approximately 12 years ago, I was the center car in

           1   trip and fall accident that resulted in any injury other

           2   than the fall that you told me about where you cracked

           3   your rib?

           4   A.     When I was at Shire Pharmaceutical back in, I'm

           5   gonna say, 15 years ago -- what would 15 years ago be?

           6                  MR. GORODETZER:  2004.

           7                  THE WITNESS:  2004 maybe.  No, not 2004.

           8   2006, approximately, I was at work and I -- there was a

           9   step that I didn't see.  And I fell and had some therapy.

          10   And that was fine.

          22   I -- if I remember right.  But it was -- it wasn't bad.

          23   It was -- I just had to get some physical therapy for a

           1   injury prior to the date of this accident?

           2   A.     I don't recall.

           3   Q.     Since the date of this accident, any time period

           4   from the date of the accident until today's date, have you

           8   your injuries related to this accident?

           9   A.     For the injuries related to this accident, I only

          10   saw her a couple times.  I see her regularly for my

          11   incontinence, my bladder infections, my sinus infections.

          12   I get -- I get infections.

          13                  When I do go in, we discuss how I'm doing

          14   from the accident as well.  But I don't go in for that

          15   purpose.  But we -- we discuss it when I do go in, and by

          16   our discussion, she would corroborate, "No, you're not

          17   ready yet."

          18   Q.     On the date of the accident -- finally, we get to

          19   the accident.  Normally, I do it way ahead of time --

          20   A.     Okay.

          21   Q.     -- but we got down a rabbit hole of medicals, so I

          22   just went with it.

          23                  MR. GORODETZER:  It's good.  It saves time

          24   on the back end.

          25                  MS. BARBETTA:  Yeah.
                                                                     58

           2   Q.     Before we get into the accident, do you need to

           3   take any type of a break at all?

           4   A.     I'm all right.

           5   Q.     All right.  Where were you coming from on the date

           6   of the accident?

          16   Q.     Around what time did the accident happen?

          17   A.     About 6:00-ish, because I worked overtime, as I

          18   ended up doing all the time.

          19   Q.     What were your typical hours at --

          20   A.     8:00 to 5:00.

          21   Q.      -- your job?

           2   Q.     That day, you worked a little bit later?

           3   A.     I worked later, 'til almost 6:00, because it was a

           4   payroll day and the other girl didn't get it finished.

           5   Q.     Did you have any plans at home that day that you

           8   Q.     Could you describe 202 for me in terms of how many

           9   lanes of travel there are in the area where the accident

          10   happened.

          11   A.     Two on each side, with a -- as you're on 202, going

          12   whatever direction that is, there is --

          13                  MR. GORODETZER:  South or north?

          14                  THE WITNESS:  Going away from Wilmington,

          15   toward --

          16                  MR. GORODETZER:  West Chester?

          19                  THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Traveling north,

          20   there's a left turn lane to -- but it is two lanes each.

          21                  MR. GORODETZER:  So just to clarify, if I

          22   may, what she's saying is that the intersection of Oakland

          23   Road, there's two lanes southbound, two lanes northbound,

          24   and a left-hand turn lane onto Oakland.

          25                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Right, going both
                                                                     60

           4   on 202, at that intersection?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6                  MR. GORODETZER:  Correct.  Because across

           7   the street is Concord Country Club, and you can make a

           8   left into --

           9                  MS. BARBETTA:  Yup.

          10                  MR. GORODETZER:  -- the country club there.

          11                  MS. BARBETTA:  I'm just clarifying that.

          12                  MR. GORODETZER:  Gotcha.

          13                  MS. BARBETTA:  I know.  I know where --

          14                  MR. GORODETZER:  All right.

          18   Oakland Road and 202.

          19   A.     I thought I did that.

          20   Q.     We just talked about 202.

          21   A.     Oh, Oakland Road.

          22                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yes.

          23                  THE WITNESS:  Oh.  One each.

          24   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          25   Q.     And how is that intersection controlled, stoplight,
                                                                     61



           1   stop sign?

           2   A.     A left turn.  A left turn.

           3   Q.     Is it controlled by a traffic light overall?

           4   A.     Yes.  Left turn traffic, yes.

           5                  MR. GORODETZER:  Not the lane.  She's just

           6   talking the intersection in general.

           7   BY MS. BARBETTA:

           8   Q.     Just in general --

           9   A.     Yeah.

          10   Q.     -- is there a light at that intersection?

          11   A.     Yeah.  Oh, yes.

          12   Q.     Sometimes I ask silly questions, but I just have to

          13   have you answer, so --

          14                  MR. GORODETZER:  She's not -- it's --

          15                  MS. BARBETTA:  I know the answer.

          16                  MR. GORODETZER:  It's to generate a clear

          17   record of the intersection described in a record.  It's

          18   not to trick you.

          19                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          20   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          21   Q.     Yeah.  It's not to trick you.  I understand that

          22   there's a traffic light.  I just need you to say the words

          23   "There are a" -- "There is a traffic light."

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     'Cause sometimes people say, "Oh, no.  There's a
                                                                     62



           1   stop sign," and then we go down a different -- different

           2   direction.

           3   A.     Right.

           4   Q.     If the accident did not happen, what was your

           5   intention?  Was it to stay straight on 202 or make a

           6   left-hand turn onto Oakland?

           7   A.     I was going home.  I live on Oakland Road.  I got

           8   in the left turn lane because that time of day on a

           9   Friday, 202 is very busy.  Instead of -- it was a green

          10   light for both lanes -- directions.  Instead of edging

          11   forward to see if I could turn left, I decided to be safe

          12   and wait for the light to turn green, the left arrow.  I

          13   did not go into the intersection until the light turned.

          14                  When the light turned, the car going south

          15   on the inner lane stopped, and there was no other car in

          16   the other lane.  So I -- being that I had the green light,

          17   I started my turn.  And I got halfway, and all I saw were

          18   the lights of this car.  No brakes.  No screeching.  Just

          19   the lights.  And bang.

          20                  He was not at the intersection when I

          21   started my turn, or I wouldn't have turned even with a

          22   green light.  My driving record shows that I don't drive

          23   carelessly.

          24   Q.     At the intersection of 202 and Oakland, is there

          25   always a green arrow to make a left-hand turn after the
                                                                     63



           1   green light cycles, or sometimes is it just the green

           2   light without the arrow, depending on the time of day?

           3                  MR. GORODETZER:  Objection to the form.

           4   It's a -- it -- just the way it was asked was a little

           5   convoluted.

           6                  MS. BARBETTA:  All right.

           7   BY MS. BARBETTA:

           8   Q.     At the intersection of 202 and Oakland, you

           9   indicated that, on the date of the accident, you had a

          10   specified green arrow in order to make your left-hand

          11   turn; is that correct?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     Is that green arrow always there in order for you

          14   to make a left-hand turn or --

          15   A.     Okay.  I know exactly what you mean.  Let me share

          16   this, because I drove it every day.

          17                  There's a green for going both directions.

          18   You can edge out if you want and then, when there's room,

          19   turn, or there is a left turn signal that stops the

          20   southbound traffic and lets you go.  Sometimes, that

          21   signal is first and then the lanes get green.  Oftentimes,

          22   it's last.  That time, it was last.

          23                  It was green in both lanes, and then it

          24   turned the -- well, like I say, the other guy had already

          25   stopped on the inner lane.  And then, it's still green
                                                                     64



           1   going north.  And the left turn lane comes on, and the

           2   other way is red.  Does that make sense?

           3   Q.     Yes.

           4   A.     Okay.  That's what it did.  I think I have a video

           5   of it doing that one day.

           6   Q.     I -- I observed the video.

           7   A.     Yeah.

           8   Q.     Did you -- do you know on what day the arrow either

           9   comes before the solid green light or when it comes after?

          10   Is there any pattern to it?

          11   A.     I have never seen a pattern.  I -- this is a guess.

          12   My hunch is that it may react to the way the traffic is.

          13   I don't know.  I have no idea.  It's not on certain days.

          14   It's not on certain times.  It just is.

          15   Q.     Is there ever a time where there is no green arrow

          16   to turn left when you're going northbound on 202 to make

          17   that left-hand turn onto Oakland, where it's just the

          18   solid green light?

          19   A.     I don't know.

          20                  MR. GORODETZER:  And just for clarifying

          21   the question, were you asking:  Is there times where the

          22   only way to make a left-hand turn would be on a solid

          23   green, where the left turn lead never comes on?

          24                  MS. BARBETTA:  Correct.

          25                  MR. GORODETZER:  Okay.
                                                                     65



           1                  THE WITNESS:  I'm not...

           2                  MR. GORODETZER:  I think the answer is

           3   still that she doesn't know.

           4                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  If there are no cars

           5   going this way, it's -- anything is possible.  I have seen

           6   it be straight through, and when my car isn't up there

           7   yet, I've seen the green light left turn not come on.  So

           8   I don't know.  It -- there's -- it's not consistent.

           9   That, I do know.  You can't depend on it.

          10   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          11   Q.     Did you see my client's car at all prior to the

          12   impact?

          13   A.     No, I did not.  He was not in the intersection.  If

          14   he had been, even though I had a green light, I would have

          15   waited.  The car on the inside lane had stopped.  The --

          16   Q.     When you say "the inside" --

          17   A.     He was -- okay.  He was on this lane.  There's two

          18   lanes.

          19                  MR. GORODETZER:  Traveling southbound?

          20                  THE WITNESS:  Traveling southbound.  So how

          21   do you call it when there's two lanes?  What --

          22   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          23   Q.     How about the -- what is the lane that's closest to

          24   the double yellow line on --

          25   A.     Okay.
                                                                     66



           1   Q.     Is that the inner lane that you're referring to?

           2   A.     That's what I'm saying, yes.

           3   Q.     Okay.  And then, there's an outer lane that is

           4   closet to where --

           5   A.     Like if you were gonna make a right turn, you could

           6   just turn right.

           7                  So the inner lane, the guy had stopped

           8   and -- or whoever, and there was no car in the other lane.

           9   And if there had been, I would have made sure that he was

          10   stopped even though I had the green left turn.

          11   Q.     I just want to backtrack a little bit.

          12   A.     Sure.

          13   Q.     As you approached the intersection at 202 and

          14   Oakland, were there any cars directly in front of you in

          15   the left-hand turn lane in the northbound 202 direction?

          16   A.     I was the first car.  Some had turned as I was

          17   getting up close, but I was the first car.

          18   Q.     As you approached that intersection, was your

          19   light -- what color was the light as you approached the

          20   intersection?

          21   A.     The light was green north and south.  I stopped

          22   anyway because I didn't -- it's Friday on 202 at

          23   6:00 o'clock.  Nah.  So I stopped to wait for the green

          24   signal even though I could have gone forward.

          25   Q.     How much time passed between when you observed --
                                                                     67



           1   when you stopped waiting for the solid green signal and

           2   then when the green arrow came on?  Approximately how much

           3   time passed?

           4   A.     I don't know.  A couple minutes probably.  I don't

           5   know time when you're at a signal, but it wasn't like

           6   immediate.  I was stopped for at least a minute or so or

           7   two minutes maybe before it actually came on.

           8   Q.     When you started to make your left-hand turn onto

           9   Oakland, you indicated you had a solid green arrow at that

          10   point; is that correct?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Did you ever observe that arrow change to any other

          13   color prior to making that turn?

          14   A.     When you're making that turn -- here's the light.

          15   Here's the light right here.  Here's my car.

          16   Q.     The light would be directly in front of you?

          17   A.     Exactly.  All right.  By the time you start here, I

          18   was here in the second lane.  By the time he hit me, I

          19   would not be able to see that signal, because of where I

          20   was.  I couldn't have seen -- seen the light change,

          21   'cause I was here.

          22   Q.     Is the green arrow, from your experience, a quick

          23   green arrow, a long green arrow, something different?

          24   A.     It varies.  I don't know for sure, but I will say

          25   this:  The barber that my husband sees is right there,
                                                                     68



           1   just down from that signal not very far.  He said that

           2   there were problems with that signal that week.  I do not

           3   know how.  I can't prove it, because there's nobody to

           4   prove it.  But he told my husband there had been problems.

           5                  But his statement was that it was going the

           6   other -- I -- I don't know.  I didn't see a problem.  The

           7   guy going south was stopped.  So he had to have had a red

           8   light, or he wouldn't have stopped.  My green was

           9   absolutely green when I started turning.  Does that make

          10   sense?

          11                  MR. GORODETZER:  Yes.

          12   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          13   Q.     Where in the intersection did the impact occur?

          14   Had you crossed over that inner lane that you were

          15   referring to, and were you in the outer lane --

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.      -- or were you fully on Oakland?

          18   A.     I -- no.  I -- I believe -- I think when he hit me,

          19   even though it hit the passenger side, it was from the

          20   passenger back.  I was already this way to Oakland Road.

          21   Q.     The --

          22   A.     Because when my --

          23   Q.     Indicating the front of your car was facing Oakland

          24   Road --

          25   A.     Oh.  My --
                                                                     69



           1   Q.     -- prior to the impact?

           2   A.     -- whole car.  The whole car was.  No.  The whole

           3   car was facing this way.

           4   Q.     I just have to say -- when you say "this way," we

           5   just have to clarify:  Your entire car was --

           6   A.     Was facing Oakland.

           7   Q.     -- horizontal, facing Oakland?

           8   A.     Yes.  And when he hit me, my car did a 180 and

           9   started -- and hit the other car and bounced back, so I

          10   ended up being alive instead of it rolling.

          11   Q.     Where was the other car located that your car made

          12   contact with after the initial impact?

          13   A.     On Oakland Road, there's a one lane and one lane

          14   here.  It stops -- by the way, it stops back here.  Here's

          15   the light.  You can't see my arrow from Oakland Road.

          16   Ain't gonna happen.

          17                  Then, there's enough shoulder for another

          18   car to be parallel with the car in the lane to turn right.

          19   That car was in the right lane to turn right.  They had

          20   not even gone.

          21                  If -- usually, the light with the arrow,

          22   once -- if -- if they had a green on Oakland, that car

          23   would have been moving, and it wasn't.  So when I did the

          24   180, I hit the other car and -- and it bounced back.

          25   Q.     How would you describe the initial impact between
                                                                     70



           1   your car and my client's car, light, medium, heavy, some

           2   other description?

           3   A.     Heavy, slam, bang.

           4   Q.     As a result of that --

           5   A.     I mean -- I mean I -- excuse me.  It was so hard,

           6   my -- my car was facing the other way when it was done.

           7   Q.     How would -- did your body move at all inside the

           8   car --

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Just let me finish the question.

          11   A.     I'm sorry.  Dang.

          12   Q.     We're almost there.  Did your body move at all

          13   inside the car as a result of the initial impact between

          14   your car and my client's car?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     How did it move?

          17   A.     As my car was -- when it was hit and then when it

          18   was turning, I was flippy-flopping.  My head hit the --

          19   the driver's window.  I was flippy-flopping all different

          20   directions.

          21   Q.     Did you have your seat belt on?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Did your airbags go off in the car?

          24   A.     On the driver's side.  I -- I mean on the passenger

          25   side.  The side ones did, but not the driver's.
                                                                     71



           1   Q.     Did you hear any noises prior to the impact,

           2   honking of horns, screeching of tires, anyone yelling out

           3   anything?

           4   A.     Nothing.

           5   Q.     After the impact, what happened after that?  I know

           6   your car did the 180.  So after your car came to a final

           7   rest, what, if anything, happened after that?  Did you get

           8   out?  Did you stay n?

           9   A.     I couldn't even get up.  I was still -- my -- the

          10   room was still spinning -- or the -- not the room, but

          11   the -- I was pretty out of it.  People came to the side of

          12   my car to see if I was all right.

          13   Q.     Did you ever get out of the car after the accident

          14   happened?

          15   A.     Eventually.  I -- when my husband finally arrived,

          16   I tried getting out of the car.  And then I had to grab

          17   onto something before I passed out.  That's when they took

          18   me to the ambulance.

          19   Q.     Did you have any conversation with my client at the

          20   scene of the accident?

          21   A.     Not yours.

          22   Q.     Did you have any conversation with anyone that

          23   witnessed the accident at the scene of the accident?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     Who did you have a conversation with?
                                                                     72



           1   A.     The constable's wife came up to the car, and she

           2   asked if I was all right.  And she said, "We saw

           3   everything."  She said, "He ran a red light.  You're not"

           4   -- "You're not at fault."  She said, "He ran a red light

           5   and hit you."

           6   Q.     Where was the -- what's the constable's wife's

           7   name?

           8   A.     Don't know.  I don't remember.

           9   Q.     Do you know her personally at all?

          10   A.     No.  No.  No, I don't.

          11   Q.     How did you know she was the constable's wife?

          12   A.     She said, "My husband is a constable," and we saw

          13   it.  That's all I got.  I don't know anything.

          14   Q.     Did -- did she indicate where she witnessed the

          15   accident from, like where her car was, anything like that?

          16   "No"?

          17   A.     No.  I'm sorry.

          18   Q.     Did you ever get her phone number or information

          19   after the accident?

          20   A.     I didn't get anything, because I nearly passed out

          21   when they put me in the ambulance.  The -- it was on the

          22   police report, the -- the constable, but not her.  But

          23   unfortunately, the constable changed his story.  Why, I

          24   don't know.

          25   Q.     Is the constable the individual who made himself
                                                                     73



           1   out to be an accident reconstructionist person?  Is that

           2   the same person that you're talking about?

           3   A.     Yes.  Strange that -- that he changed his story,

           4   but...

           5                  MR. GORODETZER:  I'm -- I'm -- just -- I

           6   know it's a late objection, but just to the

           7   characterization of "accident constructionist," I don't --

           8                  MS. BARBETTA:  That's how he identified

           9   himself in the video -- the recorded statement that you

          10   gave me.  In the recorded statement he gave Progressive,

          11   he said he was an accident reconstructionist.  That's what

          12   he said, so that's why I'm clarifying him as that.

          13                  MR. GORODETZER:  Okay.

          14                  MS. BARBETTA:  I do not know what his

          15   full-time job is.  I do not know what his background is.

          16                  THE WITNESS:  He was a constable.

          17                  MS. BARBETTA:  That is just why I am

          18   classifying him as that.

          19                  MR. GORODETZER:  I'm always interested --

          20                  Off the record.

          21                  (Discussion was held off the record.)

          22   BY MS. BARBETTA:

          23   Q.     Did you ever have any conversation with the man

          24   that you're identifying as a constable at the scene of the

          25   accident?
                                                                     74



           1   A.     No, I did not.

           2   Q.     Was the only person that you spoke with someone who

           3   identified herself as the constable's wife at the scene of

           4   the accident?

           5   A.     There was one other woman that came to the car and

           6   asked if I was okay.  She also said the same thing:  "It

           7   wasn't your fault.  He ran a red light."  I don't know who

           8   she was.  I didn't get a name.  But she wanted to make

           9   sure I was okay.

          10   Q.     And just to clarify my previous question, the only

          11   person -- you never spoke to the constable.  You only

          12   spoke to the constable's wife at the scene of the accident

          13   --

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     -- other than this other --

          16   A.     She actually came up to the car twice.

          17   Q.     You indicated that you believe the constable

          18   changed his story after the accident.  What did you mean

          19   by that?

          20   A.     He told me husband that -- that -- that I ran a red

          21   light, that he had a green light, that for some reason,

          22   all of a sudden, I turned on a red light.  Except that I

          23   know you can't see my light from where he was sitting.  He

          24   was on the inside -- he was on the lane to turn left.

          25   Q.     Do you know where his car was located, if he was on
                                                                     75



           1   Oakland, if he was on 202, wherever he was?

           2   A.     He was on Oakland, ready to turn left, according to

           3   the police report pictures that I saw.

           4   Q.     And at the scene of the accident, it's my

           5   understanding your husband had a conversation with the man

           6   who -- who was identified as a constable?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     And at the scene of the accident, the constable

           9   told your husband that you had a red light?

          10   A.     Uh-huh.

          11   Q.     Is that a "yes"?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     And you disagree with that?

          14   A.     Oh, hands down.  I had a green light.  I -- that is

          15   my normal route -- was my normal route.  I am meticulous.

          16   At that time of day, you do not go unless you have the

          17   green arrow, because there's too much traffic.

          18                  And there's no -- and -- and that

          19   particular night, I made sure that I had the green arrow.

          20   I didn't even go with the -- the green.  The other cars

          21   were still going.  So if -- if I had a red, why were the

          22   other cars still going?  I don't understand that, but he

          23   can say what he wants.  I know what I saw.

          24   Q.     The barber that you were talking about that your

          25   husband goes to, do you know what the barber's name is or
                                                                     76



           1   where he works?

           2   A.     He's a barber there.  He actually is a constable

           3   for Chadds Ford also, but I don't remember his name.

           4   Q.     And his barbershop is off of 202 or off of --

           5   A.     It's off of 202.

           6   Q.     Near where the accident happened?

           7   A.     Just down the street.  He didn't see the accident.

           8   Q.     And that was, once again, your husband having the

           9   conversation with the barber --

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     -- about the light at that intersection?

          12   A.     Yes.  But it's all hearsay because none of it is...

          13   Q.     Hearsay doesn't matter for a deposition, but I just

          14   try and identify who knows what and who said who (sic) to

          15   who.

          16                  Did you call police or ambulance, or did

          17   they just arrive to the scene?

          18   A.     Someone else called.

          19   Q.     And you left the scene of the accident in the

          20   ambulance?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Other than talking to your husband, the constable's

          23   wife, and the other woman who approached you at the scene

          24   of the accident, did you speak with anybody else at the

          25   scene of the accident?
                                                                     77



           1   A.     The state trooper took my story.

           2   Q.     Was it a male or female?

           3   A.     Male.

           4   Q.     And the state trooper just asked you what happened?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Did the state trooper indicate what anyone else

           7   said about how the accident happened to you?

           8   A.     No, he did not.  If he had, I would have said

           9   something right there.

          10   Q.     At the scene of the accident, did you feel pain in

          11   any part of your body?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     What --

          14   A.     My head, my neck, my back.  And then, I was having

          15   trouble breathing.

          16   Q.     Have you had any contact with the constable since

          17   the date of the accident?

          18   A.     No, no one.

          19   Q.     Did you have an opportunity to hear his statement

          20   to your insurance company?  Have you ever heard that?

          21   A.     No.  I read the -- the police report.

          22   Q.     Did you ever read any type of a recorded statement

          23   that he gave to Progressive Insurance Company?

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     Other than reading the police report, did -- are
                                                                     78



           1   you aware of any other statements that he gave?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     Have you spoken to anyone that you met at the scene

           4   of the accident since the date of the accident?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Other than your husband, of course.

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     Was there anything you felt you could have done to

           9   avoid the accident from happening?

          10   A.     Not a thing except not turn on my green, but I did

          11   not see -- the sad thing is he wasn't at the intersection.

          12   He wasn't there.  If he was even close, I would have

          13   waited.  But I didn't even see him.

          14   Q.     Did you ever get your car repaired after the

          15   accident, or was it totaled?

          16   A.     It was totaled.  Yeah, it was definitely totaled.

          17   I had to get another one.

          18   Q.     Are you aware of any unpaid medical bills as a

          19   result of the accident?  Did you receive anything in the

          20   mail?

          21   A.     They're not unpaid now.  I paid whatever had to be.

          22   Q.     Did you receive bills in the mail and then pay

          23   those bills?

          24   A.     There were a few.

          25   Q.     Did you give those to your attorney?
                                                                     79



           1   A.     He has everything.

           2                  MR. GORODETZER:  I don't know if I have

           3   any of the -- any -- if there's any specific or

           4   out-of-pockets or co-pays, I'm not sure.  I'd have to go

           5   back and look.

           6                  MS. BARBETTA:  Okay.

           7                  MR. GORODETZER:  I don't think I asked for

           8   them.  The other thing, just to update you, that I

           9   hadn't -- just had the epiphany with the Colonial Penn

          10   when we were putting the discovery together.  So I have

          11   the -- I have the Medicare lien, which I -- I'll request

          12   an update on.

          13                  MS. BARBETTA:  Perfect.  That's what I was

          14   gonna say.

          15                  MR. GORODETZER:  And I don't have the --

          16   Colonial Penn is gonna have the -- it's a -- the

          17   supplement is gonna have a Medicare lien also that I'm --

          18   that I'll get for -- from them now.

          19                  I actually have another client who I don't

          20   think is your -- your -- I don't know if that's -- I've

          21   never asked you, but I have a client who's a broker for

          22   Colonial Penn, so she might be able to help me -- direct

          23   me to the right people to talk to for -- for their subro

          24   apartment.

          25                  MS. BARBETTA:  Okay.
                                                                     80



           1                  THE WITNESS:  I have -- I brought a --

           2                  MR. GORODETZER:  There's no question

           3   pending, so...

           4   BY MS. BARBETTA:

           5   Q.     At the time of the accident, did you have health

           6   insurance?

           7   A.     Yes, Medicare and Colonial Penn.

           8   Q.     Since the date of the accident, has there ever been

           9   a time period where you did not have that insurance?

          10   A.     No.  Always active.

          11   Q.     And do you still have that same insurance today?

          12   A.     Yes, same policy.

          13   Q.     We've already talked a little bit about this in

          14   terms of how the accident affected your work life, but I

          15   wanted just to see more about how the accident affected

          16   your everyday life.  So you don't have the repeat the work

          17   life stuff -- I've already got that down -- unless there's

          18   something that you didn't tell me that you would like me

          19   to know.

          20                  But my first set of question is:

          21   Activities, interests, hobbies, things in your life that

          22   you were completely unable to do for any time period after

          23   the accident.  The next set of questions I'll ask is:

          24   Activities, interests, hobbies, just regular living, daily

          25   things in your life that maybe you could still do but you
                                                                     81



           1   might have had pain or discomfort or some issues when you

           2   were doing it as a result of the accident.  Do those two

           3   distinctions make sense for you?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     So let's talk about the first category.  Was there

           6   anything in your life that you were completely unable to

           7   do for any time period after the accident?

           8   A.     Balance my bank statement, anything having to do

           9   with analytical anything.  And actually, there were days

          10   when I didn't cook, because I was confused.  And I'm --

          11   I'm thinking.  It's hard to remember right after the

          12   accident, 'cause I didn't do much of anything for quite a

          13   while.

          14                  But intermittently, there are days when I

          15   don't attempt certain things, because I can't focus

          16   enough.  Like I said, there are days when I don't cook,

          17   because I end up putting something in the refrigerator

          18   that belongs on the stove, or I leave the stove on, or I

          19   put the wrong ingredient in.  I'm spaced out.

          20   Q.     Did that ever happen to you, the instances in the

          21   kitchen, prior to the date of the accident?

          22   A.     No.  Whatever I say to you now, it'll be things

          23   that did not happen prior to the accident.

          24   Q.     Okay.

          25   A.     I didn't always read or do anything else, because I
                                                                     82



           1   had a hard time following what I was reading, focus, et

           2   cetera.  Gosh.  There were many things that I didn't do.

           3   I'm -- I'm trying to think what else.

           4                  At first, because my back hurt and my neck

           5   and everything, he would make the bed and do different

           6   things like that.

           7   Q.     "He" being your husband?

           8   A.     Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  My husband would help me

           9   with -- with all of that housework and such.  But me being

          10   the tenacious person I am and determined to try, after a

          11   couple months, I would try and sometimes fail.  And he

          12   would tell me to go sit down.

          13                  But as I said, it -- it became

          14   intermittent.  It's not something I have consistently,

          15   except that the focus and the -- the -- the ability to

          16   think of words, that's really affected me, I think, more

          17   than anything.  Because I was a very -- I was known as

          18   very glib, very capable of editing and doing.  And I was

          19   very organized, and I did all kinds of wonderful things.

          20                  And I cannot do most of that anymore.  And

          21   I have -- I have a hard time dealing with that, I'll be

          22   honest.  It's tough.  I've been having depression.

          23   Q.     Do you treat with any therapist for the depression?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     Did you treat with any therapist prior to the date
                                                                     83



           1   of the accident?

           2   A.     No.  I mean I did back in -- in the year 1990, but

           3   that's been a long time ago.

           4   Q.     Do you see a specific therapist now, after the

           5   accident?

           6   A.     Yeah.  I just started seeing him recently because I

           7   crashed.  And I -- I saw a therapist once after the

           8   accident, Springfield Psychological.  I forgot her --

           9   Nicole Cash.  And then I didn't see anybody for a long

          10   time.

          11                  I kept telling myself:  I don't want to go

          12   into it.  And then, when I crashed recently, I started

          13   seeing Dr. Kacher, K-A-C-H-E-R, Cognizant Behavior

          14   something in Chadds Ford.

          15   Q.     Did you discuss the accident with him?

          16   A.     Yes.  Oh, yes, among other things.  There's other

          17   things going on too.  It was like I had something happen

          18   recently that was like the feather that broke -- you know?

          19   It all crashed down.

          20                  And they put me on -- Dr. Glessner had put

          21   me on antidepressants, and it wasn't working, this -- this

          22   year.  And so when I started to see the psychologist, they

          23   had me see a psychiatrist to monitor other, you know,

          24   medications that would work.  His name is Capucao,

          25   C-A-P-A-C-A-O (sic), and he is with Cognizant Behavior.
                                                                     84



           1   He's a psychiatrist.  The other one's a psychologist.

           2   Q.     And Dr. Capucao monitors the medication that you're

           3   on?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     And are you feeling any better now that he's

           6   monitoring it as opposed to your primary care doctor?

           7   A.     Yes.  He has me on a combination of two.

           8   Q.     What is that?

           9   A.     Zoloft and Wellbutrin.

          10   Q.     And have you been feeling any better since seeing

          11   the combination --

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.      -- of those doctors?

          14   A.     Yes.  Oh, definitely, yes.

          15   Q.     And when did you start seeing them?

          16   A.     I started seeing him a couple months ago and the

          17   psychiatrist, a month and a half ago, I believe, estimate.

          18                  That's another thing that my brain doesn't

          19   do well.  I -- I'm bad with dates.  My husband has to help

          20   me with these now.  Very bad with memory.  My memory is

          21   zilch.

          22                  Sometimes he'll ask me -- he'll say, "Well,

          23   I just told you about that.  What was it?"  And I'll say,

          24   "I have no clue.  It's not there."

          25   Q.     Is it short-term memory or long-term or
                                                                     85



           1   combination?

           2   A.     Combination, but a lot of the -- a lot of

           3   short-term memory problems that I did not have before.  I

           4   mean he can say something, and I'll say, "What was that?"

           5   Or -- or later, he'll say to me, "Well, I already told you

           6   earlier today."  And I think:  It's just not there.

           7                  It literally just -- you can't even bring

           8   it back.  It's like:  Oh, okay.  I did not have that kind

           9   of problem before exponentially.  So I'm having to come to

          10   terms with some of this.

          11   Q.     And I know you indicated that a lot of the

          12   limitations, you were having for the couple months after

          13   the accident.  And now are you still having those issues

          14   but just more on and off, like good day, bad day?  Or how

          15   are you feeling?

          16   A.     As far as the memory, it's -- it's the same.

          17   It's -- I mean it's some days, I'm more focused than

          18   others.  But the memory is not great.

          19                  I've never had a problem with confidence in

          20   doing tasks until after the accident.  Something happened.

          21   I've always thought of myself as the tenacious, get in

          22   there and do it all.  And it -- I -- it's not there.

          23   Q.     Could you give me an example.

          24   A.     Whatever the task was, I was ready to get in there

          25   and do it.  I even -- you know, it didn't matter if I
                                                                     86



           1   didn't know it.  I'd learn it.  I was very good at, you

           2   know, mastering new things and -- no problem.

           3                  But just the thought of it now, I'm -- I'm

           4   like:  I -- I don't know.  It's like -- my husband tells

           5   me I've changed.  And I keep trying to say, "No, I

           6   haven't," but I'm pretending.

           7   Q.     Any other ways that the accident affected your life

           8   either like around the house, relationship with your

           9   husband, anything like that that you can think of?  I know

          10   you've given me a lot of examples, but...

          11   A.     There could be.  I -- it's not in the forefront of

          12   my brain at the moment.

          13   Q.     Have you been on vacation at all since the accident

          14   happened?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     Do you have any children?

          17   A.     Yes, two sons.

          18   Q.     Any grandchildren?

          19   A.     One.  They live in Honey Brook.

          20   Q.     Did the accident affect your relationship with

          21   either your sons or your grandchild at all?

          22   A.     I don't see them as often as I'd like, because I

          23   have more off days than on, but...

          24   Q.     How old is your grandchild?

          25   A.     He's either 9 or 10.
                                                                     87



           1   Q.     Did the accident affect anything about your social

           2   life at all?  Did you used to go out and do any type of

           3   activities with your husband that changed at all after the

           4   accident?

           5   A.     I'm more a stay-at-home these days, but I used to

           6   be quite gregarious.  But in some ways, yes.

           7   Q.     How -- how so?

           8   A.     I don't get out as much as I used to.

           9   Q.     You mentioned that you want to go back to working.

          10   Is there a specific field or any jobs that have come up

          11   that pique your interest, or is it just kind of an

          12   open-ended see what happens?

          13   A.     I'm having a hard time figuring out what I think I

          14   can do.  I mean the things that I think are easy -- like

          15   retail, you think:  Oh, that's -- and then I think:  No.

          16   See, 'cause you got to be able to work the cash register.

          17   Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.

          18                  And those things used to be my strengths.

          19   I'm still trying to find if there's something I can do

          20   that isn't gonna impact the -- the company.

          21   Q.     Does your husband still work currently, or is he

          22   retired?

          23   A.     No.  He's retired.

          24   Q.     Has he been retired since the accident or some --

          25   A.     He retired --
                                                                     88



           1   Q.     -- period of time before that?

           2   A.     -- at age 65.  He was with the school district,

           3   and -- and he retired.  Let's see.  He was born in -- he's

           4   been retired four years.

           5   Q.     All right.  Anything else about the accident or the

           6   effects that the accident has had on your life that we

           7   have not talked about, that you would like me to know

           8   about?

           9   A.     There probably is, but I can't think.

          10   Q.     No problem.

          11                  MS. BARBETTA:  All right.  Those are all

          12   the questions that I have for you.  I'm not sure if your

          13   attorney has anything.

          14                  MR. GORODETZER:  Nope.

          15                  (Witness excused.)

 1   R I C H A R D   S A L Z M A N N, called as a
 2          witness, having been duly sworn by a
 3          notary public, was examined and
 4          testified as follows:
 5   EXAMINATION BY
 6   MR. GREENSTONE:
 7                 MR. COLAO: I assume we're
 8          reserving all objections except as to
 9          form?
10                 MR. GREENSTONE: That's fine
11          and we'll go ahead and mark as Exhibit
12          1 the Notice of the Taking of the
13          Audiovisual Deposition and as Exhibit
14          2 as the Objections and Responses of
15          Defendant IMO Industries, Inc. to
16          Plaintiffs' Third Amended Notice of
17          Taking Deposition.
18                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, Notice
19          of Taking Audiovisual Deposition,
20          marked for Identification.)
21                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 2,
22          Objections and Responses of Defendant
23          IMO Industries, Inc. to Plaintiffs'
24          Third Amended Notice of Taking
0011
 1          Deposition, marked for
 2          Identification.)
 3          Q.    Good morning, sir.
 4          A.    Good morning.
 5          Q.    You and I have met once before,
 6   but my name is David Greenstone.  Would you
 7   please state your full name for the record?
 8          A.    Richard Salzmann.
 9          Q.    You understand that you are
10   here giving your testimony today in two
11   cases, the Kenneth Balthazar case and the
12   Charles McDaniel case?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    Is it accurate that you are
15   here as the corporate representative of IMO
16   Industries, Inc.?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    Can we agree for purposes of
19   this deposition that when we're talking about
20   IMO Industries, Inc. we are also talking
21   about De Laval Steam Turbine Company?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    And probably for most of the
24   deposition I will actually refer to De Laval
0012
 1   or De Laval Steam Turbine Company.  Is that
 2   appropriate and will you understand that I'm
 3   referring to IMO Industries, Inc., the
 4   company that you are the corporate
 5   representative for?
 6          A.    Yes.
 7          Q.    You understand here that you
 8   are speaking on behalf of IMO Industries,
 9   Inc. and De Laval Steam Turbine Company,
10   true?
11          A.    Yes.
12          Q.    And it's your understanding
13   that you have authority to speak on behalf of
14   IMO Industries, Inc. and De Laval Steam
15   Turbine Company, true?
16          A.    Yes, I believe that's correct.
17          Q.    Just so it's clear for the
18   ladies and gentlemen of the jury, when you
19   are talking today, you are talking as the
20   corporation, you are talking as IMO
21   Industries, Inc. and De Laval Steam Turbine
22   Company, fair?
23          A.    If that's the definition of the
24   corporate rep, then yes.
0013
 1          Q.    It's your understanding that
 2   you are in fact the corporate representative,
 3   true?
 4          A.    That's correct.
 5          Q.    I'm going to talk to you about
 6   three basic topics for purposes of this
 7   deposition.  The first topic is going to De
 8   Laval's historical knowledge about the
 9   dangers of asbestos.  The second topic is
10   going to be De Laval's conduct or how they
11   responded relating to asbestos and the third
12   topic is going to be related to De Laval
13   pumps and turbines that had asbestos
14   components or utilized asbestos insulation,
15   okay?
16          A.    Okay.
17          Q.    I want to start out before I
18   get there with some preliminary matters.
19   First of all, is it accurate, sir, that De
20   Laval Steam Turbine Company was a seller and
21   manufacturer of products that had asbestos
22   components for more than 50 years?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
24          A.    I'm not sure of the exact time,
0014
 1   but we built precision mechanical equipment
 2   some of which contains small and/or medium
 3   size components that contained asbestos.
 4          Q.    We'll get to the years -- well,
 5   De Laval as far as you know started selling
 6   equipment with asbestos components at least
 7   as early as the 1930s, true?
 8          A.    That's correct.
 9          Q.    They continued to sell these
10   products with asbestos components without
11   interruption until the 1980s, true?
12          A.    It depends on the component,
13   but some yes.
14          Q.    If we start in the thirties and
15   end in the eighties, it's accurate that for
16   over 50 years De Laval Steam Turbine Company
17   manufactured and sold equipment that had
18   asbestos components, true?
19          A.    Some, yes.
20          Q.    In fact, De Laval also sold
21   asbestos products themselves, true?
22          A.    In some cases where spare parts
23   were included as part of customer's orders,
24   that may be true.
0015
 1          Q.    For example, I guess we need a
 2   little bit of background.  When you were
 3   talking about the asbestos components that
 4   were utilized in some De Laval pumps and
 5   turbines, you are referring to in some
 6   occasions asbestos gaskets and asbestos
 7   packing material, true?
 8          A.    That's correct.
 9          Q.    In addition to actually selling
10   the pump or the turbine with that piece of
11   asbestos component inside it, De Laval on
12   occasion also sold spare parts which would
13   have been just the asbestos gasket or the
14   asbestos packing as requested by a customer?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          Q.    True?
17          A.    That's possible on some
18   occasions, yes.
19          Q.    In fact, you know that De Laval
20   Steam Turbine Company made available asbestos
21   gaskets and asbestos packing for sale, true?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
23          A.    I believe that's the case.  I
24   can't remember specific records to that
0016
 1   affect, but that probably is the case.
 2          Q.    Sure.  You have seen bills of
 3   materials, for example, that indicate that De
 4   Laval Steam Turbine Company will be providing
 5   spare asbestos gaskets and spare asbestos
 6   packing, true?
 7          A.    On occasion, yes.
 8          Q.    And you were aware that De
 9   Laval made available and sold asbestos gasket
10   and asbestos packing material from the 1930s
11   until the 1980s, true?
12          A.    That is generally true, yes.
13          Q.    It is also accurate that at
14   least on occasion De Laval has sold asbestos
15   thermal insulation products, true?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
17          A.    On relatively infrequent
18   occasions, yes.
19          Q.    I think you and I have
20   discussed that issue before.  As you sit here
21   today, can you quantify for the jury how many
22   times De Laval sold asbestos thermal
23   insulation from the 1930s until say the
24   1970s?
0017
 1          A.    No, I can't.
 2          Q.    De Laval on occasion did sell
 3   thermal insulation products that contained
 4   asbestos from the 1930s up until the 1970s,
 5   true?
 6                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 7          A.    Until 1972 that's true.
 8          Q.    Sorry?
 9          A.    Until 1972 that's true on
10   relatively infrequent occasions.
11          Q.    If we take it from the 1930s
12   until the 1970s, De Laval would have been a
13   seller of asbestos thermal insulation
14   products for a period of about 40 years,
15   true?
16                 MR. COLAO: Same objection,
17          mainly to the term seller, but you can
18          answer the question.
19          A.    Yes, when a customer ordered
20   asbestos or any insulation and the material
21   that was being used at that time happened to
22   contain asbestos, then De Laval would provide
23   it as part of a contractual obligation to a
24   customer.
0018
 1          Q.    It would generally be asbestos
 2   thermal insulation products that would be
 3   used as insulation for a De Laval turbine,
 4   true?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Subject to the
 6          prior objection, go ahead.
 7          A.    Again, generally is a very
 8   broad term.  It often was, but there are
 9   other materials that were used on occasion.
10          Q.    Fair enough.  I think I
11   understand what the nature of your
12   qualification was and my point simply was
13   when De Laval did on occasion sell asbestos
14   thermal insulation products between the time
15   period of the 1930s until the 1970s, it was
16   insulation that was going to be used on De
17   Laval turbines, true?
18          A.    Yes, normally, yes.
19          Q.    I want to shift gears now and
20   talk to you about the first item that I
21   mentioned at the very beginning which was De
22   Laval's knowledge about the dangers of
23   asbestos.  Now we've discussed as we just
24   pointed out that De Laval sold and
0019
 1   manufactured equipment that had asbestos
 2   components and also sold asbestos replacement
 3   components for a period of about 50 years.
 4                Would you agree that when De
 5   Laval knew about the dangers of asbestos is
 6   an important inquiry?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 8          I don't know why he would have that
 9          basis of knowledge.
10          A.    That's your call.
11          Q.    Fair enough.  As the corporate
12   representative of a company that sold
13   products with asbestos components for more
14   than 50 years, do you think that it's
15   important to find out when your company may
16   have first learned that asbestos was
17   dangerous to human beings?
18                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
19          It may be beyond the scope of the
20          deposition notice whether he believed
21          it was important, but I'll let him
22          answer the question.
23          A.    After the fact in today's
24   environment, yes, that seems important.
0020
 1          Q.    Would you also agree that it is
 2   important for a company to tell the truth
 3   about its products?
 4          A.    Yes.
 5          Q.    It's important for a company to
 6   not misrepresent the safety or the hazards
 7   associated with their products, true?
 8          A.    That's generally true.
 9          Q.    Would you agree that it is in
10   fact irresponsible corporate conduct in your
11   opinion as the corporate representative of
12   IMO to give inaccurate information about
13   products that you are selling?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
15          Again, I don't know if it's part of
16          the scope of his deposition notice,
17          but I'll let him answer the question.
18          A.    Would you repeat the question,
19   please?
20          Q.    Sure.  Would you agree as the
21   corporate representative for IMO, someone
22   who's been involved with this company for a
23   number of years, would you agree that it's
24   irresponsible for a company to give
0021
 1   inaccurate information about its products
 2   particularly as it relates to hazards?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 4          A.    That's generally true, yes.
 5          Q.    How many years have you been
 6   with De Laval Steam Turbine Company or IMO?
 7          A.    I spent 32 years with IMO while
 8   they owned the company, yes.
 9          Q.    When did you start with the
10   company?
11          A.    1962.
12          Q.    Are you currently still
13   employed by the company?
14          A.    No.
15          Q.    When did you cease being
16   employed directly by IMO?
17          A.    In 1994.
18          Q.    What was your position at the
19   time that you retired from IMO?
20          A.    Manager of compressor
21   engineering.
22          Q.    Over the time period that you
23   have been with this company more than 30
24   years starting in the sixties going up until
0022
 1   at least the nineties, is it your testimony
 2   that De Laval and IMO have been truthful and
 3   accurate about potential hazards associated
 4   with their products?
 5          A.    Yes.
 6          Q.    Do you believe that De Laval
 7   has been truthful and accurate about when
 8   they first knew that asbestos was hazardous?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    It's your testimony, is it not,
11   on behalf of De Laval that De Laval did not
12   know about any potential hazards of asbestos
13   to human beings until approximately 1972,
14   true?
15          A.    To the best of my knowledge,
16   yes.
17          Q.    In 1972 something happened that
18   in your testimony put De Laval on notice and
19   that would have been the passing of the
20   Occupational Safety and Health
21   Administration, the OSHA asbestos standard,
22   is that true?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection.  Are you
24          characterizing prior testimony or are
0023
 1          you just asking him a question?
 2                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'm asking him
 3          the question.
 4                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.  Go
 5          ahead.
 6          A.    Yes, I'm not sure exactly what
 7   the --
 8          Q.    What happened in 1972 that in
 9   your opinion was the first thing that put De
10   Laval on notice that asbestos could be
11   hazardous to human beings potentially?
12          A.    The OSHA regulations were
13   recognized by De Laval and its customers to
14   some extent.
15          Q.    You believe as you sit here
16   today as the corporate representative of De
17   Laval, you believe that it is accurate that
18   1972 was the first time that De Laval knew
19   anything about the potential hazards of
20   asbestos?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
22          and answered, but go ahead.
23          A.    Yes, that's what the records
24   suggests.
0024
 1          Q.    You are comfortable testifying
 2   to that to this jury in this case?
 3          A.    Yes.
 4          Q.    Have you seen any documents or
 5   any publications or anything that's made you
 6   question that testimony, sir?
 7          A.    No.
 8          Q.    You and I have talked before in
 9   deposition, me asking you questions and you
10   answering questions such as today and it was
11   a few months ago I think and in the
12   intervening months since the last time that
13   you and I have spoken, have you seen any
14   documents that would make you believe that
15   perhaps De Laval knew prior to 1972 or may
16   have known that asbestos was hazardous to
17   human beings?
18          A.    I have seen no authoritative
19   documents to that affect, no.
20          Q.    Have you been given any
21   documents from IMO from the folks at De Laval
22   Steam Turbine Company that have made you
23   think perhaps they knew prior to 1972 that
24   asbestos was hazardous to human beings or
0025
 1   could potentially be hazardous?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 3          A.    No.
 4          Q.    Haven't seen anything?
 5          A.    No.
 6                 MR. COLAO: Asked and answered.
 7          Q.    Would you agree, sir, that in
 8   fact and I think you have agreed in the past
 9   that one of the things that De Laval did to
10   stay abreast of knowledge regarding their
11   products was to monitor trade publications;
12   is that accurate?
13          A.    Yes, with respect to the design
14   of its products, yes.
15          Q.    Have you ever heard of a trade
16   publication called the Southern Power &
17   Industry journal?
18          A.    I've heard the name recently,
19   yes.
20          Q.    Do you know whether or not De
21   Laval Steam Turbine Company had a close
22   cooperation relationship with that trade
23   journal starting back as early as the 1940s?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
0026
 1          A.    Again, I'm aware that only from
 2   previous depositions that there were some
 3   advertisements that De Laval had in that
 4   publication.
 5                MR. GREENSTONE: I want to show
 6          you what I'll mark as Exhibit 3 to
 7          the deposition.
 8                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 3,
 9          Affidavit and January 1946 Southern
10          Power & Industry Journal, marked for
11          Identification.)
12          Q.    It is the January 1946 Southern
13   Power & Industry journal and you can actually
14   see on the front page under the affidavit
15   that that's in fact what it is.
16                Have you seen that document
17   before, sir?
18          A.    I can't recall if I have seen
19   this exact one.  I just don't remember the
20   dates.
21          Q.    Let's turn if we could --
22   that's fair enough.  Let's turn if we could
23   to page 8.  It's one of the pages that I have
24   tabbed.  It's a page that starts at the top
0027
 1   Where To Get It And How to Do It, Index of
 2   Helpful Booklets, Bulletins, Reference
 3   Literature.  Do you see where I am, sir?
 4          A.    Yes.
 5          Q.    Then it says at the very top
 6   cooperating with leading manufacturers of
 7   equipment and supplies, SPI makes available
 8   for the asking without cost or obligation the
 9   following valuable bulletins, booklets,
10   handbooks and catalogs.  Do you see where I
11   read that, sir?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    Did I read that correctly?
14          A.    Yes.
15          Q.    If we look at the other section
16   that I've highlighted, first of all, there
17   are a number of different catalogs that are
18   listed and little blurbs and then if you look
19   at one that's under the tab 172, do you see
20   where I'm reading?
21          A.    Yes.
22          Q.    It says pumps, compressors,
23   turbines, catalog 1181.  Complete
24   presentation of De Laval line of pumps,
0028
 1   centrifugal compressors, worm gear, speed
 2   reducers and IMO oil pumps engineering
 3   details and company background, De Laval
 4   Steam Turbine Company, Trenton, New Jersey.
 5   Did I read that correctly?
 6          A.    Yes.
 7          Q.    Before I showed that to you,
 8   sir, were you aware that the relationship
 9   that De Laval Steam Turbine Company had with
10   Southern Power & Industry magazine was that
11   Southern Power & Industry would actually
12   distribute De Laval engineering details and
13   company background in their manuals?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
15          I don't know if that's what it states,
16          but go ahead.
17          A.    It distributed a catalog which
18   advertised our products to potential users I
19   believe is what the correct context is here.
20          Q.    When it says at the top it says
21   that SPI Southern Power & Industry was
22   cooperating with leading manufacturers of
23   equipment and supply, in that context they
24   are supplying De Laval catalogs to customers?
0029
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 2          Q.    Is that accurate?
 3                 MR. COLAO: I don't know what
 4          context you are referring to, but go
 5          ahead.
 6          A.    Yeah, again, I'm not sure
 7   exactly what's going on, but I would suspect
 8   that De Laval has provided some of its
 9   catalogs that could be requested through this
10   magazine.
11                 MR. COLAO: Sounds like
12          speculation in the testimony. I'll
13          just caution the witness to give
14          testimony about what he knows and to
15          not assume or speculate.
16                 THE WITNESS:  That's fine.
17          Q.    In any event, there's certainly
18   nothing improper or wrong or even unusual
19   about De Laval working with Southern Power &
20   Industry giving them their catalogs so that
21   SPI, the magazine, could distribute them to
22   the public?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
24          A.    In my experience that's a
0030
 1   relatively unusual thing, but obviously
 2   that's what's stated here.
 3          Q.    Before I showed that to you,
 4   you didn't know that that was occurring?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 6          Was occurring.
 7          Q.    I'll re-ask.  Before I showed
 8   you this document, you didn't realize that De
 9   Laval had been cooperating with Southern
10   Power & Industry to make their manuals
11   available to the public as indicated here?
12                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
13          Specifically to the understanding of
14          cooperating, but go ahead.
15          A.    The cooperating is a problem
16   here, but as I said before, I think I have
17   been shown this magazine or at least some
18   issue of it in a previous deposition so this
19   is not the first time I have seen at least a
20   similar advertisement.
21                 MR. COLAO: Let me just add
22          this for the record, it's an extension
23          of my prior objection.  We are asking
24          the witness about a publication that
0031
 1          was issued in 1946.  He was not at De
 2          Laval during that time so I just want
 3          to make the record clear that he
 4          obviously can't be testifying from
 5          personal knowledge about what was
 6          happening during that time.  He's only
 7          testifying based upon what he's being
 8          shown and read from this Exhibit.
 9                 MR. GREENSTONE: Well, I
10          actually would like to respond to
11          that. The deposition notice, the
12          30(b)(6) witness, he's testifying as
13          the corporate representative of De
14          Laval on the subject of when De Laval
15          knew that asbestos was hazardous if
16          ever so that's in the context I'm
17          asking him this question.
18                 MR. COLAO: I understand that,
19          but the only point I'm making is that
20          in testifying as the corporate
21          representative and based upon his
22          knowledge as corporate representative,
23          he obviously could not have personal
24          knowledge of what was going on in
0032
 1          1946.
 2                 MR. GREENSTONE: That's fair.
 3          I'll try to clear it up.
 4          Q.    Sir, you understand here that
 5   you are the corporate representative speaking
 6   on behalf of De Laval Steam Turbine Company
 7   and IMO Industries on the subject of when De
 8   Laval Steam Turbine Company first knew that
 9   asbestos was hazardous if ever; is that your
10   understanding?
11          A.    To the extent of my knowledge,
12   yes.
13          Q.    It's your testimony that you
14   are the person most knowledgeable on that
15   subject that's currently with the company?
16          A.    I'm not currently with the
17   company.
18                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
19                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me strike
20          that and re-ask it.
21          Q.    It's your testimony that as far
22   as you know you are the person most
23   knowledgeable on that subject for IMO?
24          A.    I don't know of anybody who's
0033
 1   more knowledgeable at this point.
 2          Q.    Fair enough and before you had
 3   seen this particular document in the course
 4   of litigation, did you know that it existed?
 5          A.    No.
 6          Q.    Let's turn to the last tab that
 7   I have, it's page 158, that's the
 8   advertiser's index; is that correct?
 9          A.    That's correct.
10          Q.    And under the Ds is De Laval
11   Steam Turbine Company listed as an advertiser
12   in this particular publication?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    Were you aware before you saw
15   this document for the first time in
16   litigation that De Laval was an advertiser in
17   Southern Power & Industry?
18                 MR. COLAO: In 1946?
19          A.    No.
20                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me strike
21          it.  Let me re-ask it so there's
22          actually a clear question.
23          Q.    Were you aware before you saw
24   this document in litigation that De Laval
0034
 1   advertised in Southern Power & Industry
 2   magazine in the 1940s?
 3          A.    No.
 4          Q.    Did De Laval Steam Turbine
 5   Company have an advertising department in the
 6   1940s if you know?
 7          A.    I don't know.
 8          Q.    Do you know anything at all
 9   about advertising and how it works as it
10   relates to the company that you worked for?
11                 MR. COLAO: In general?
12                 MR. GREENSTONE: As it relates
13          to IMO.
14          A.    No.
15          Q.    Fair enough.  Do you know if
16   the advertising department had to approve
17   advertisements after they paid for them?
18                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
19          and answered.  He said he didn't know
20          anything about it, but go ahead.
21          A.    I don't know.
22          Q.    Fair enough.  Let's turn, sir,
23   to page 68 of this same document that De
24   Laval is listed in the advertiser's index in.
0035
 1   Are you on page 68?
 2          A.    Yes.
 3          Q.    There is an article there by an
 4   N.V. Hendricks entitled Industrial Hygiene
 5   Control of Working Environment is Important
 6   and you can see down there at the bottom
 7   again this is from January 1946, is that what
 8   the document says, sir?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    If we turn to page 74 of this
11   same article in this publication there is a
12   section that's called Silica and Dust,
13   correct?
14          A.    Yes.
15          Q.    It indicates there and there's
16   a part that I highlighted that says however,
17   asbestos dust is just as toxic as free
18   silica, did you see that?
19          A.    I see that.
20          Q.    Before you saw this document in
21   the context of litigation, did you have any
22   idea that De Laval had been listed as an
23   advertiser in a publication that had
24   published that asbestos was toxic in the
0036
 1   1940s?
 2          A.    No, not before I had seen this.
 3          Q.    If we turn to page 76, there is
 4   another part in the middle of the page that
 5   I've highlighted and it talks about control
 6   procedures, do you see that?
 7          A.    Yes.
 8          Q.    It recommends control
 9   procedures such as isolation of the process,
10   substitution of non toxic material, wet
11   methods to wet down the hazardous materials,
12   personal protective equipment, local exhaust
13   ventilation.  Are all of those things listed
14   as control procedures in this 1946
15   publication of Southern Power & Industry?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form
17          and just taking those pieces out of
18          context, but if he can answer the
19          question, he can go ahead and do that.
20          A.    What's the question whether I
21   see them?
22          Q.    Whether those things that I
23   read off are listed as control procedures for
24   hazardous operations in this 1946 version of
0037
 1   Southern Power & Industry?
 2          A.    Yes, I see that they are
 3   listed.
 4          Q.    1946 would be some 26 years
 5   before 1972, correct?
 6          A.    That's correct.
 7          Q.    Before you had seen this
 8   document in litigation, you didn't realize
 9   that the Southern Power & Industry was
10   distributing De Laval catalogs and you didn't
11   know that De Laval was an advertiser in this
12   magazine and you certainly didn't know that
13   this magazine had published that asbestos was
14   toxic in 1946?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          A.    I had not been aware of these
17   particular articles, no.
18          Q.    Seeing what you have seen from
19   this document, the 1946 publication that
20   indicates that asbestos was toxic and what
21   you have seen referenced about De Laval, does
22   that cause you to change your opinion in any
23   way that De Laval first learned of the
24   potential hazards of asbestos in 1972?
0038
 1          A.    No, I have seen no evidence of
 2   what the corporation was aware of prior to
 3   1972.
 4          Q.    The truth is you don't have any
 5   idea at all as to whether or not De Laval
 6   received this publication and read it in the
 7   1940s, true?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection;
 9          argumentative.
10          A.    I don't know what happened in
11   the 1940s, I was not there.
12          Q.    So you don't know at all
13   whether De Laval actually knew in the 1940s
14   that this publication had indicated that
15   asbestos was toxic to human beings, true?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
17          A.    Again, I was not there in 1946
18   and I don't know what or whether this
19   magazine was ever read by anybody at De
20   Laval.
21          Q.    Despite that fact, you still
22   feel comfortable testifying that 1972 is the
23   first time that De Laval knew about any
24   potential hazards of asbestos?
0039
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 2          and answered.
 3          Q.     Is that fair?
 4          A.    Based on the evidence that I'm
 5   aware of, yes.
 6          Q.    That evidence now includes this
 7   publication, true?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
 9          A.    Yes.
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
11                 MR. GREENSTONE: We have to
12          make sure we are not jumping all over
13          the witness.
14          Q.    The evidence that you have now
15   includes this publication, correct?
16          A.    I have seen this publication,
17   yes.
18                MR. GREENSTONE: Let me ask you
19          about another one that I'll go ahead
20          and mark as Exhibit 4 to the
21          deposition.
22                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4,
23          Affidavit and November 1946 Southern
24          Power & Industry Journal, marked for
0040
 1          Identification.)
 2          Q.    It's the November 1946 version
 3   of Southern Power & Industry.  We just looked
 4   at January 1946, now I'm showing you November
 5   of 1946.  Have you seen that document before
 6   to your knowledge?
 7          A.    I'm not sure specifically.
 8          Q.    You see that this does indicate
 9   that it's the November 1946 version of
10   Southern Power & Industry?
11          A.    Yes, November 1946 issue.
12          Q.    Let's turn to page 8.  It's
13   tabbed I believe.  Again, there's a section
14   like we saw in the January article that
15   indicates Index of Helpful Booklets,
16   Bulletins, Reference Literature and the
17   language at the top is the same, it says
18   cooperating with leading manufacturers of
19   equipment and supplies, SPI makes available
20   for the asking without cost or obligation the
21   following valuable bulletins, booklets,
22   handbooks and catalogs.  Did I read that
23   correctly, sir?
24          A.    Yes.
0041
 1          Q.    In the middle of the page 172
 2   pumps, compressors, turbines, complete
 3   presentation of De Laval line of steam
 4   turbines, helical gears, centrifugal pumps,
 5   centrifugal compressors, worm gear, speed
 6   reducers and IMO oil pumps, engineering
 7   details and company background, De Laval
 8   Steam Turbine Company, Trenton, New Jersey.
 9   Did I read that correctly?
10          A.    You left out catalog 1181, 24
11   pages, but yes.
12          Q.    Fair enough.  That's basically
13   at least as far as you can recall a similar
14   statement as was in the January '46
15   publication, true?
16          A.    Yes, it is.
17          Q.    If we turn to the advertiser's
18   index, that's the last tab?
19                 MR. COLAO: Page?
20                 MR. GREENSTONE: Page 134.
21          Q.    You see again that De Laval
22   Steam Turbine Company is also listed as an
23   advertiser in this publication, true?
24          A.    Yes.
0042
 1          Q.    Were you aware before you saw
 2   this publication in litigation that De Laval
 3   was listed as an advertiser in the November
 4   1946 Southern Power & Industry?
 5          A.    If I have seen this specific
 6   one in litigation and as I say I don't
 7   remember the dates that I have seen, then
 8   yes, I was aware of it from that.
 9          Q.    My question was a little
10   different, it was prior to seeing this
11   document in litigation if you have seen it
12   in litigation, were you aware that De Laval
13   was listed as an advertiser in the November
14   '46 version of Southern Power & Industry?
15          A.    No, not before I had seen it in
16   litigation.
17          Q.    Again, you certainly were not
18   aware that Southern Power & Industry was
19   actually providing De Laval pamphlets,
20   booklets to the public?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
22          Q.    True?
23          A.    To the public is a little
24   broad.  I think they were addressed to
0043
 1   potential users of the equipment, industrial
 2   users.
 3          Q.    I think you are exactly right.
 4   In fact, on that page, page 8, it says this
 5   service is restricted to those interested in
 6   the operation or design of industrial power
 7   and service plants.  Did I read that
 8   correctly?
 9          A.    Yes, you did.
10          Q.    That's what you just said which
11   is that they are not just making these
12   available to the public, they are making
13   pamphlets available to people interested in
14   this particular type of business and in this
15   trade, true?
16          A.    Interested in buying that type
17   of equipment, yes.
18          Q.    You did not know that De Laval
19   had this type of relationship with Southern
20   Power & Industry in the 1940s?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to the
22          phrase relationship, but go ahead.
23          A.    Again, I was not around in the
24   1940s and I'm not -- I was not aware of it,
0044
 1   no.
 2          Q.    In light of the objection I'll
 3   just ask a slightly different question which
 4   is that you were not aware that in the 1940s
 5   Southern Power & Industry was distributing De
 6   Laval pamphlets, true?
 7          A.    That's correct.
 8          Q.    If we look at one of the other
 9   tabbed pages, there is page 61, will you turn
10   to that, please.  There's another article in
11   this publication from November by N.V.
12   Hendricks that says Industrial Hygiene
13   Importance of Dust.  Do you see that?
14          A.    Yes.
15          Q.    Again, we can see that this is
16   the article from November '46, Southern Power
17   & Industry, true?
18          A.    That's correct.
19          Q.    It says in the paragraph that I
20   highlighted aside from any nuisance or
21   economic loss resulting from the escape of
22   dust, there are certain dust exposures which
23   may result in acute health hazards.  This is
24   especially true of dust containing a high
0045
 1   percentage of free silica, asbestos or other
 2   toxic materials.  Did I read that correctly,
 3   sir?
 4          A.    Yes.
 5          Q.    You certainly were not aware
 6   that this was published in Southern Power &
 7   Industry in November of '46, true?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 9          A.    That's correct.
10          Q.    If we turn to the next page,
11   page 62, there is paragraph that I've
12   highlighted that's entitled Pneumoconiosis.
13   Do you know what pneumoconiosis is?
14          A.    No.
15          Q.    Under the section that's
16   entitled a, pneumoconiosis, it says the dust
17   producing this type reaction are harmful only
18   when inhaled.  The principal materials
19   producing this type of reaction are free
20   silica and asbestos dust.  On inhalation
21   these two materials produce specific lung
22   pathology and from the standpoint of
23   disability present the most important of the
24   dust exposures.  Did I read that correctly,
0046
 1   sir?
 2          A.    Yes.
 3          Q.    Were you aware that asbestos
 4   and silica were the most important from a
 5   health standpoint of the dust exposures in
 6   the 1940s?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 8          The article that you read didn't say
 9          that, but go ahead.
10          A.    I had not seen this specific
11   article again prior to litigation.
12          Q.    Again, this statement that
13   acute health hazards can occur from breathing
14   asbestos occurs in a version of Southern
15   Power & Industry in which De Laval Steam
16   Turbine Company is listed as an advertiser,
17   true?
18          A.    They are listed as an
19   advertiser, yes.
20          Q.    It's listed in a version of
21   Southern Power & Industry that indicates that
22   the journal Southern Power & Industry is
23   distributing De Laval pamphlets, true?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
0047
 1          and answered.
 2          A.    That's correct, I said that
 3   before.
 4          Q.    Again, November of 1946 is some
 5   26 years before 1972, true?
 6          A.    Yes, it is.
 7          Q.    Does this document now the
 8   second one that we've seen that indicates
 9   that asbestos is toxic in the 1940s, does
10   that cause you to change your testimony that
11   the first time that De Laval knew of
12   potential hazards of asbestos would have been
13   1972?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
15          A.    To the best of my knowledge my
16   previous testimony is correct.
17          Q.    Your previous testimony is that
18   De Laval didn't know anything about asbestos
19   until 1972?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
21                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me strike
22          that.
23          Q.    Your prior testimony is that De
24   Laval didn't know anything about the
0048
 1   potential hazards of asbestos to humans until
 2   1972, true?
 3          A.    That's correct based on what I
 4   have seen, yes.
 5          Q.    You have absolutely no idea, do
 6   you, sir, if anybody at De Laval Steam
 7   Turbine Company received this November 1946
 8   publication of Southern Power & Industry, do
 9   you?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection;
11          argumentative.
12          A.    I don't have any idea what
13   happened in 1946, no.
14          Q.    You don't have any idea whether
15   anybody at De Laval read this article that
16   indicated that asbestos was toxic and could
17   cause acute health hazards in 1946, do you?
18                 MR. COLAO: Same objection. I
19          don't know how he could have.  Go
20          ahead.
21          A.    I could not have known that,
22   no.
23          Q.    Even in light of the fact that
24   you really don't know if anyone at De Laval
0049
 1   ever got this document or received it even
 2   though they are listed in the advertiser's
 3   index, you are still comfortable with your
 4   testimony that De Laval could not have known
 5   about the dangers of asbestos until 1972?
 6                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 7          A.    That's correct.
 8          Q.    These documents don't cause you
 9   to take pause or change that testimony at
10   all?
11                 MR. COLAO: I think he's
12          answered that question a couple of
13          times, but one more time, go ahead.
14          A.    I have answered that question
15   many times.
16                MR. COLAO: Go ahead.
17          Q.    Sir, do the documents
18   collectively, the January 1946 Southern Power
19   & Industry that De Laval was listed as an
20   advertiser in that indicated that asbestos
21   was toxic or the November of 1946 Southern
22   Power & Industry that De Laval was listed as
23   an advertiser in that also indicated that
24   asbestos was toxic, those documents
0050
 1   collectively don't cause you to change your
 2   opinion at all that the first time De Laval
 3   could have known about the hazards of
 4   asbestos was 1972; is that true?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.  Go
 6          ahead.
 7          A.    That's correct.  My knowledge
 8   is based on documents that I have seen and
 9   actions the company took thereafter and I
10   believe my opinion or my statements have been
11   correct.
12          Q.    Do you know if De Laval was a
13   member of any industry organizations, trade
14   organizations?
15          A.    I'm not sure of membership
16   times or the specific organizations, but I
17   have seen responses to that affect in
18   interrogatory responses.
19          Q.    Are you aware of any trade
20   organizations that you were a member of on
21   behalf of De Laval or while you were employed
22   by De Laval or IMO?
23          A.    It was not on behalf of IMO,
24   but I was a member of and am a member of The
0051
 1   American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
 2          Q.    That organization is referred
 3   to sometimes as ASME?
 4          A.    ASME, yes.
 5          Q.    When did you join The American
 6   Society of Mechanical Engineers, sir?
 7          A.    1962 I believe.
 8          Q.    That was after you went to work
 9   at De Laval that you became a member of ASME?
10          A.    Yes, I had become exposed to it
11   while I was still in school.
12          Q.    Were other members or other
13   employees of De Laval also members of ASME in
14   1962 when you joined?
15          A.    Yes.
16          Q.    To your knowledge if you know
17   had there been De Laval employees that were
18   members of ASME prior to 1962?
19          A.    I believe there were, but I
20   don't know specifically as I sit here.
21          Q.    Would you attend ASME
22   conferences?  Were there any ASME
23   conferences?
24          A.    Yes.
0052
 1          Q.    Did you attend those sometimes
 2   with other De Laval representatives?
 3          A.    On occasion.
 4          Q.    Did you receive ASME
 5   publications?
 6          A.    Yes.
 7          Q.    They would publish a newsletter
 8   or a bulletin to their members; is that true?
 9          A.    They publish a magazine.
10          Q.    That would go out to the ASME
11   members, correct?
12          A.    That is correct.
13          Q.    What types of things would be
14   discussed at ASME conferences that you
15   attended and I don't want an exhaustive list,
16   if you could just remember a couple if you
17   do?
18          A.    The large majority of topics
19   covered had to do with the design of various
20   types of machinery and mechanical equipment,
21   at least those aspects of it that mechanical
22   engineers would be interested in.
23          Q.    What about the ASME magazine or
24   publication, what type of information was in
0053
 1   it?
 2          A.    Again, the majority of it had
 3   to do with the design of equipment that
 4   mechanical engineers would have an interest
 5   in.
 6          Q.    Was there hazard material
 7   published in the ASME publications to your
 8   knowledge?
 9          A.    I can't recall.  I'm not sure
10   what you mean by that.
11          Q.    I asked a bad question.  Was
12   there information about hazardous operations
13   and ways to avoid them that were published by
14   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers
15   in their publication?
16          A.    There may have been from time
17   to time, sure.  I don't know.
18          Q.    Did they publish anything about
19   the dangers of asbestos?
20          A.    I can't recall.
21          Q.    Can't recall?
22          A.    I can't recall.
23          Q.    Have you gone back and made any
24   attempt to look at ASME publications from the
0054
 1   1930s or forties or fifties to see what they
 2   may or may not have said about the dangers of
 3   asbestos?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5                MR. GREENSTONE: Is that because
 6          I asked about thirties, forties,
 7          fifties and sixties?
 8                 MR. COLAO: It's also the
 9          phrasing have you made an attempt to
10          go back.  One doesn't know if he has
11          access to those.
12          Q.    Have you tried to go back and
13   find or locate any ASME publications from any
14   period of time to figure out what they may
15   have printed about the dangers of asbestos?
16          A.    No.
17          Q.    You don't know whether ASME was
18   publishing anything about the hazards of
19   asbestos in the 1930s or forties or fifties
20   before you started becoming a member of ASME?
21          A.    No.
22          Q.    You don't?
23          A.    I don't know.
24          Q.    You do know that you were a
0055
 1   member while you were at De Laval and other
 2   people at De Laval were also members, true?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 4          and answered.
 5          A.    Certainly while I was there,
 6   yes.
 7          Q.    Do you know how many people
 8   were members of ASME at De Laval when you
 9   were there?
10          A.    No, I don't.
11          Q.    I'm not looking for specifics,
12   but was it the type of thing that pretty much
13   everybody in the company was encouraged to
14   join or can you say?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          Go ahead.
17          A.    The people that I knew that
18   were most likely to join were the engineering
19   people.
20          Q.    The people that were most
21   involved in the design and manufacture of
22   pumps and turbines?
23          A.    Yes, the design certainly.
24          Q.    Was that a large group of
0056
 1   people when you started at De Laval?
 2          A.    It was a couple hundred people
 3   I would say.
 4          Q.    You think it's accurate that
 5   there were, again, I'm not looking for
 6   specifics, but is it a fair characterization
 7   that there were a couple of hundred people at
 8   De Laval in the 1960s that were a member of
 9   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers?
10          A.    You're saying 100 percent.  I
11   don't know that.  No, I would suspect that's
12   not the case.
13          Q.    Is it a fair characterization
14   that at least a good portion of the people
15   who were engineers and involved in the design
16   of turbines and pumps would have been members
17   of The American Society of Mechanical
18   Engineers?
19                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
20          Q.    If you know.
21          A.    Again, I don't know a
22   percentage, but there were a number I'm sure
23   that were members.
24                MR. GREENSTONE: We do have some
0057
 1          publications from The American
 2          Society of Mechanical Engineers here
 3          and I wanted to show you one. It will
 4          be the next document 5.
 5                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 5,
 6          The American Society of Mechanical
 7          Engineers Publication, marked for
 8          Identification.)
 9          Q.    Do you recognize that document
10   to be the publication of The American Society
11   of Mechanical Engineers, the title is
12   Mechanical Engineering?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
14          I don't know -- are you asking if he's
15          ever seen this before?
16                 MR. GREENSTONE: My question
17          was a little different.
18                 MR. COLAO: Same objection
19          then.
20          A.    Yes, it's a publication of the
21   ASME, yes.
22          Q.    Is that the same type of
23   publication that you would have received even
24   if you didn't receive this one?
0058
 1          A.    Yes.
 2          Q.    Was that to your knowledge what
 3   the publication was called the Mechanical
 4   Engineering?
 5          A.    Yes.
 6          Q.    This one is from February 1935,
 7   true?
 8          A.    Yes, this is February 1935.
 9          Q.    To your knowledge had you seen
10   that before I just showed it to you?
11          A.    No, I don't believe so.
12          Q.    But to make sure we're clear
13   for the record this is the same American
14   Society of Mechanical Engineers that you and
15   I have been talking about to your knowledge,
16   true?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    This is the same American
19   Society of Mechanical Engineers that you
20   indicated you were a member of and a number
21   of people at De Laval were a member of at
22   least in 1962, true?
23          A.    That's correct.
24          Q.    Let's turn to the first page
0059
 1   that's tabbed.
 2                 MR. COLAO: Page?
 3                 MR. GREENSTONE: Page 90.
 4                 MR. COLAO: I don't have the
 5          tabs.
 6                 MR. GREENSTONE: I apologize.
 7          Q.    There's an article there called
 8   Occupational Diseases, correct?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    The Problems of Their
11   Practicable Prevention in Industry by F.
12   Robertson Jones.  Do you see that?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    First of all did you by chance
15   know Mr. F. Robertson Jones?
16          A.    No.
17          Q.    Ever heard of him?
18          A.    No.
19          Q.    Let's take a look at what this
20   publication of The American Society of
21   Mechanical Engineers was publishing in 1935
22   and it's the highlighted portion.  It says
23   the preponderance of medical opinion is that
24   of the inorganic dust constantly generated in
0060
 1   industry only dust of free silica (silicon
 2   dioxide) and perhaps asbestos dust and these
 3   dusts only when in minute particles are
 4   harmful, that is, harmful in the sense and to
 5   the extent of causing specific disabling
 6   diseases of the lungs.  Did I read that
 7   correctly?
 8          A.    Yes.
 9          Q.    Did you have any idea that The
10   American Society of Mechanical Engineers was
11   publishing that in 1935?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          I don't believe he was around in 1935.
14          A.    No, I wasn't, much as I may
15   look to the contrary, no, I wasn't --
16          Q.    Sir --
17          A.    -- aware of what they were
18   publishing in '35.
19          Q.    I certainly don't mean for
20   there to be any levity in the question and
21   that's kind of the point of my question, sir,
22   that you did not have any idea before I
23   showed it to you that this was published in
24   an American Society of Mechanical Engineers
0061
 1   journal in 1935, true?
 2                 MR. COLAO: That's a different
 3          question.  Go ahead.
 4          A.    I'm not aware that I was aware
 5   of that, no.
 6          Q.    In fact you didn't know?
 7          A.    No.
 8          Q.    If we turn, sir, to a page
 9   that's entitled -- the next tab there is
10   another article.
11                 MR. COLAO: Again, I need a
12          page.
13                 MR. GREENSTONE: 95.
14          Q.    It's an article entitled Toxic
15   Dusts, Their Origin and Sources in Various
16   Industries by Mr. Reuel Stratton. Do you see
17   that?
18          A.    Yes.
19          Q.    Did I read that correctly?
20          A.    Yes.
21          Q.    Have you ever seen this article
22   before to your knowledge?
23          A.    Not to my knowledge.
24          Q.    In this article of Toxic Dusts
0062
 1   if you'll turn to the next page that's tabbed
 2   is Asbestos and Asbestos-Goods Manufacturing
 3   mentioned?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          Mentioned on this page you're saying?
 6          Q.    Do you see a reference in this
 7   article about toxic dust to asbestos?
 8          A.    You've highlighted a portion.
 9          Q.    Let's read it.  It's on page --
10   you are on the right page, sir.  There's a
11   section that's titled in this article that's
12   entitled Toxic Dust there's a section
13   entitled Asbestos and Asbestos-Goods
14   Manufacturing, any mining operations and
15   quarry operations are exposures previously
16   discussed.  In the manufacturer of asbestos
17   goods, particularly dusty atmospheres are
18   created in the break-out, opener and picking
19   operation.  The crushing and grinding of the
20   fiber as well as all spinning and weaving
21   operations have a tendency to throw asbestos
22   fiber into the air and create a source of
23   dust contamination and then it says the next
24   sentence that I've also highlighted crushing
0063
 1   and grinding asbestos products generates
 2   dust.  Do you see that?
 3          A.    I see that.
 4          Q.    Before I showed it to you, you
 5   were not aware that this was published about
 6   asbestos in 1935 by The American Society of
 7   Mechanical Engineers, true?
 8          A.    I was not aware of that, no.
 9          Q.    If we turn to the last page
10   there's a section that I've highlighted that
11   says Conclusion, page 98.  I'll read from it.
12   One should not necessarily conclude that
13   every operation listed in this paper is an
14   absolutely dangerous source or point of
15   origin of a toxic dust.  It should not be a
16   foregone conclusion that the operations
17   listed in this paper include all of the
18   possible sources of toxic dust.  The
19   operations discussed, however, are typical of
20   those where known cases of exposure have
21   occurred.  Did I read that correctly?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    If we read the very last
24   sentence that I've highlighted, it says all
0064
 1   in all, it's best for any engineer to proceed
 2   upon the basis that any dust of any type in
 3   any concentration creates an industrial
 4   exposure and to suppress the dust at its
 5   origin.  Did I read that correctly?
 6          A.    I guess you did.
 7          Q.    Did you have any idea that The
 8   American Society of Mechanical Engineers, an
 9   organization that you were a member of in the
10   1960s, indicated in 1935 through its
11   publication that any dust of any type in any
12   concentration creates an industrial exposure
13   and should be suppressed?
14          A.    Would you repeat that question?
15          Q.    Did you have any idea that in
16   1935 The American Society of Mechanical
17   Engineers, an organization that you were a
18   member of in the sixties, published this
19   article indicating that any dust of any type
20   in any concentration creates an industrial
21   exposure and should be suppressed?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
23          and answered, but go ahead.
24          A.    No, I was not aware of this
0065
 1   article.
 2          Q.    Given that this article was
 3   published in 1935 which is some 35 years
 4   prior to 1972, does this cause you to change
 5   your opinion at all about when De Laval may
 6   have first known that there were any
 7   potential hazards of asbestos dust?
 8          A.    No, not for that specific
 9   question, no.
10          Q.    Even though it was published in
11   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers
12   publication?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
14          what was published?
15          A.    Would you repeat the question?
16          Q.    Your opinion has not changed
17   that De Laval first learned about the dangers
18   of asbestos in 1972 even though The American
19   Society of Mechanical Engineers published in
20   the 1930s that there may be potential hazards
21   of asbestos?
22                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
23          A.    That's correct.
24          Q.    This doesn't change your
0066
 1   opinion?
 2          A.    The documents I have seen
 3   suggest that De Laval learned of it in 1972
 4   and acted on it thereafter.
 5          Q.    This magazine would have been
 6   one as you mentioned that went to members of
 7   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers
 8   in 1935, true?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
10          I don't know if he knows that.
11          A.    Again, I don't know that in
12   1935.  It certainly went to members of ASME
13   when I was a member.
14          Q.    You don't have any knowledge
15   that that practice changed in the thirties,
16   forties, fifties or sixties as it relates to
17   the ASME, do you?
18          A.    I don't know that, no.
19                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let's take a
20          look at the next document that I'll
21          mark as Exhibit number 6 to the
22          deposition which is another
23          publication from The American Society
24          of Mechanical Engineers from 1939.
0067
 1                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 6,
 2          The American Society of Mechanical
 3          Engineers Publication, marked for
 4          Identification.)
 5          Q.    Again, does that appear to be a
 6   true and accurate copy of a publication from
 7   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers?
 8          A.    Top page says it is, yes.
 9          Q.    Again, you recognize this as
10   the publication that you received when you
11   were a member even if you didn't get this one
12   because it was prior to when you were a
13   member, true?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
15          A.    That's the name of the
16   publication as I recall it and as I received
17   it.
18          Q.    This one again to make sure
19   it's clear for the record this was in May
20   1939, this was before you were a member,
21   fair?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    Let's turn to the page I have
24   tabbed.
0068
 1                 MR. COLAO: Page?
 2                 MR. GREENSTONE: 405.
 3          Q.    There's a book review listed
 4   here -- I'll read it to you, Silicosis and
 5   Asbestosis by various authors cited by A.J.
 6   Lanza Oxford University Press London and New
 7   York 1938.  Comprehensive presentation of the
 8   medical and public health aspects of these
 9   industrial dust diseases is provided in this
10   work to which several physicians have
11   contributed.  The history of the diseases,
12   their symptoms and diagnosis, their pathology
13   and their prevalence in various occupations
14   are discussed as well as methods of
15   prevention and control.  Each section has a
16   bibliography.  Did I read that correctly?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    Were you aware, sir, that in
19   1939 The American Society of Mechanical
20   Engineers did a book review on this book
21   called Silicosis and Asbestosis?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
23          A.    I wouldn't call it a book
24   review.  It's certainly informing you about a
0069
 1   publication.
 2          Q.    Were you aware, sir -- then I
 3   will use your language.  Were you aware that
 4   in 1939 The American Society of Mechanical
 5   Engineers had a little blurb in their
 6   publication that talked a book entitled
 7   Silicosis and Asbestosis?
 8          A.    No, I wasn't aware of that.
 9          Q.    You were not aware that the
10   book they are referencing in 1939 was a book
11   that was a comprehensive presentation of the
12   medical and public health aspects of these
13   industrial dust diseases and the diseases
14   they are talking about are silicosis and
15   asbestosis, true?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
17          A.    No, I didn't realize that at
18   that time.
19          Q.    Sir, would you agree that this
20   would have been a publication that
21   individuals that were involved in engineering
22   and designing De Laval pumps and turbines
23   would have had access to in 1939?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection to
0070
 1          whether he would have known what they
 2          had access to in '39.  Go ahead.
 3          A.    If this publication was sent to
 4   members and there were members of the ASME,
 5   yes.
 6          Q.    They would have had access to
 7   it?
 8          A.    Yes, they would have.
 9          Q.    Same question as it relates to
10   the 1935 publication.  Would you agree with
11   me, sir, that if De Laval had members of The
12   American Society of Mechanical Engineers in
13   1935 that they would have had --
14          A.    1939.
15          Q.    I'm sorry, I went back to the
16   other one.
17          A.    I'm sorry.
18          Q.    Let me ask this question.
19   Would you agree with me, sir, if De Laval had
20   employees who were members of the ASME in
21   1935 they would have had access to the 1935
22   publication as well?
23                 MR. COLAO: And this was
24          distributed to them.
0071
 1          A.    Yes, if it was sent out like it
 2   was when I was a member, yes.
 3          Q.    You know that the practice that
 4   you understand it from the ASME is that they
 5   sent this publication to their members, true?
 6          A.    When I was a member, yes.
 7          Q.    If De Laval had members of the
 8   ASME in 1935 and the practice hadn't changed,
 9   then De Laval would have or De Laval
10   employees would have received this
11   publication in 1935?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          A.    Yes, if the practice was the
14   same, that's correct.
15          Q.    You don't know of anything or
16   heard of anything that would indicate to you
17   that the practice was any different in 1935
18   than it was in 1960, true?
19          A.    I don't know that it was any
20   different, no.
21                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me show
22          you one final document relating to The
23          American Society of Mechanical
24          Engineers, sir, and I'll mark this
0072
 1          document as Exhibit 7 to the
 2          deposition.
 3                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 7,
 4          The American Society of Mechanical
 5          Engineers Geographical List of
 6          Members, marked for Identification.)
 7          Q.    Luckily we have a membership
 8   list for the American Society of Mechanical
 9   Engineers so we can look and see who was a
10   member when.
11                 MR. COLAO: Is that a question?
12          Q.    Were you aware that there was a
13   membership list of The American Society of
14   Mechanical Engineers that indicated who was a
15   member and when?
16          A.    I'm sure that there was a
17   membership list, yes.
18          Q.    Do you know if you were ever
19   listed in the ASME membership list?
20          A.    I may have been.  I never
21   looked.
22          Q.    Did you, first of all, I've
23   handed you the document I marked as Exhibit
24   7.  Do you recognize this to be the
0073
 1   membership list of The American Society of
 2   Mechanical Engineers?
 3          A.    No.
 4          Q.    It says --
 5          A.    I don't know what it looked
 6   like.
 7          Q.    Fair enough.  It says
 8   Geographical List of Members United States of
 9   America Including Territories and
10   Dependencies. If you look at the top of the
11   next page it says ASME membership list?
12                 MR. COLAO: Is there a
13          question?
14          A.    Yes, it does.
15          Q.    Is that what it says, sir?
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    Were you aware, sir, that the
18   ASME kept a membership list of all their
19   members?
20          A.    I'm sure I would have guessed
21   that they did.
22                 MR. COLAO: Once again I'll
23          caution you not to guess because
24          neither I nor Mr. Greenstone want your
0074
 1          guesses today.
 2          Q.    Let's turn to the page that I
 3   have tabbed, sir, and there is a reference
 4   here that's highlighted to Lawrenceville.
 5   Let me ask you about Lawrenceville.  It's
 6   again Lawrenceville, New Jersey.  Did De
 7   Laval Steam Turbine Company have some
 8   operation in Lawrenceville, New Jersey?
 9          A.    There was a headquarters at
10   certain periods of time in Lawrenceville,
11   yes.
12          Q.    Here I believe the way this is
13   broken down so you could follow along with me
14   is that they list the states and then the
15   cities and then individuals who are members
16   from that geographic region.  Under the
17   section on page 87 for Lawrenceville and for
18   some reason it says Philadelphia section even
19   though we are talking about Lawrenceville,
20   New Jersey. First of all, do you know why it
21   says that?
22          A.    The ASME was divided up into
23   sections and I presume that Lawrenceville was
24   included in the Philadelphia section.
0075
 1          Q.    Fair enough.  It indicates on
 2   this page, page 87 that a Clarence Grissley,
 3   assistant engineer, De Laval Steam Turbine
 4   Company is listed here in the membership list
 5   under Lawrenceville, New Jersey, correct?
 6                 MR. COLAO: Is there a date on
 7          this document?
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: Getting to it.
 9          A.    I see that.
10          Q.    Do you see in the little
11   parenthesis next to his name it says 1912?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    Sir, is it your understanding
14   that that would indicate the date when Mr.
15   Grissley joined The American Society of
16   Mechanical Engineers?
17                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
18          A.    I'm not sure.  It may be.
19          Q.    Do you know what other date
20   that would reference other than the date that
21   this individual joined The American Society
22   of Mechanical Engineers?
23                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
24          A.    No, graduation from college or
0076
 1   when he became an engineer, I don't know.
 2          Q.    Did you know Mr. Clarence
 3   Grissley?  Was he at De Laval when you were
 4   there?
 5          A.    No, I didn't know him and I'm
 6   not aware that he was there when I was.
 7          Q.    Had you ever heard of him?
 8          A.    No.
 9          Q.    Does this indicate to you, sir,
10   if that parenthesis means the date that this
11   individual joined The American Society of
12   Mechanical Engineers, does that indicate to
13   you that certainly a De Laval employee would
14   have had access to ASME publications starting
15   in 1912?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
17          A.    I'm not even sure they
18   published a magazine in 1912, but I don't
19   know.
20          Q.    Certainly De Laval Steam
21   Turbine Company was around in 1912, true?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    They were founded in 1901?
24          A.    Yes.
0077
 1          Q.    Sir, wouldn't the fact that Mr.
 2   Grissley is listed here as an engineer in the
 3   De Laval Steam Turbine Company or actually I
 4   guess he's an assistant engineer at De Laval
 5   Steam Turbine Company, wouldn't his reference
 6   here as a member of the ASME indicate to you
 7   that De Laval employees would have received
 8   ASME publications at least as early as 1912
 9   if that's the date when he joined?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
11          and answered.  I think he said he
12          didn't know.  Go ahead.
13          A.    Yes, I don't know what
14   publications or what the form of ASME was in
15   1912.  I have no idea what he received or
16   didn't receive.
17          Q.    Based on this one guy who's an
18   employee of De Laval, if the date in
19   parenthesis is when he joined ASME, you are
20   not prepared to say that based on that guy
21   being a member of the ASME in 1912 if that's
22   what it means that De Laval would have had
23   access to these publications in the 1930s?
24                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
0078
 1          A.    Again, I don't know what ASME
 2   was or was not publishing in 1912.
 3          Q.    But we do know what they were
 4   publishing in 1935 and in 1939, true?
 5          A.    You showed me some
 6   publications, yes.
 7          Q.    Let's turn then, sir, if we
 8   could to page 292.  There's a reference to
 9   Trenton, New Jersey.  What's the significance
10   of Trenton, New Jersey as it relates to De
11   Laval?
12          A.    That's the location of the
13   turbine division plant.
14          Q.    That was the location of the
15   turbine division plant during what periods of
16   time if you know?
17          A.    All the periods of time between
18   1901 and 1994.
19          Q.    Did you work at that particular
20   plant?
21          A.    Yes.
22          Q.    If we look at page 92 under the
23   Trenton, New Jersey ASME membership list
24   there's a number of references that I've
0079
 1   highlighted and I'll read through them and
 2   see if I've read them correctly.  First of
 3   all, a Randall Ashton and then it says in
 4   parenthesis 1935, engineering instruction and
 5   reports, De Laval Steam Turbine Company.  Did
 6   I read that correctly?
 7          A.    Yes.
 8          Q.    Did you know Mr. Randall
 9   Ashton?
10          A.    No.
11          Q.    The next reference that I
12   highlighted for you is Rudolph Birmann and
13   then in parenthesis 1923, 1930, designing
14   engineer, De Laval Steam Turbine Company, VP
15   chief engineer Turbo Engineering Corporation.
16   Did I read that correctly?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    Did you know Mr. Rudolph
19   Birmann?
20          A.    I knew of him.
21          Q.    Was he there when you were
22   there?
23          A.    No.
24          Q.    He was gone before you were
0080
 1   there?
 2          A.    Yes.
 3          Q.    He would have been a guy at De
 4   Laval in the 1930s?
 5          A.    I don't know when he arrived,
 6   no, for sure.
 7          Q.    Certainly you don't have any
 8   reason to dispute that he was a designing
 9   engineer at De Laval Steam Turbine Company
10   and the vice-president and chief engineer of
11   the Turbo Engineering Corporation?
12          A.    That's what it says, yes.
13          Q.    The next reference Justus
14   Bryan and then it says 1930, 1935, chief
15   draftsman, IMO pump division, De Laval Steam
16   Turbine Company.  Did you know Mr. Justus
17   Bryan?
18          A.    No.
19          Q.    Next it says Austin Church,
20   1928, 1934, 1936, engineering department, De
21   Laval Steam Turbine Company, Trenton.  Did I
22   read that correctly?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    Next one that I've highlighted
0081
 1   Mr. Hans Gartmann.  First of all, let me back
 2   up.  Did you know Mr. Austin Church?
 3          A.    No.
 4          Q.    Next there Mr. Hans Gartmann,
 5   1930, 1935, engineering pump and compressor
 6   department, De Laval Steam Turbine Company.
 7   Did I read that correctly?
 8          A.    Yes.
 9          Q.    Did you know Mr. Hans Gartmann?
10          A.    Yes.
11          Q.    Was he there when you were
12   there?
13          A.    He had already retired when I
14   was there.
15          Q.    How did you know him?
16          A.    He was a retiree.  I met him on
17   several occasions.
18          Q.    Did you know that he was a
19   member of The American Society of Mechanical
20   Engineers?
21          A.    Not specifically.
22          Q.    Did you ever go to any
23   conferences with him?
24          A.    No, not that I recall.
0082
 1          Q.    Let's look at the next one,
 2   Russell Haldeman and then it says J 1933.  Do
 3   you know if that meant joined in 1933?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          A.    No, I don't know what that
 6   means.
 7          Q.    Then it says expr. engr.  Does
 8   that mean to you expert engineer, do you know
 9   what that designation is?
10          A.    I don't know for sure, but I
11   would say it's probably experimental.
12          Q.    Experimental engineer, fair
13   enough, sir.  Russell Haldeman, 1933,
14   experimental engineer, De Laval Steam Turbine
15   Company.  Did you know Mr. Haldeman?
16          A.    Haldeman I think it is and I
17   did not know him, no.
18          Q.    Let's look at the next one
19   Gordon Holbrook and then it says J 1939 and
20   it says the same thing experimental engineer,
21   De Laval Steam Turbine Company.  Did I read
22   that correctly?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    Did you know Mr. Gordon
0083
 1   Holbrook?
 2          A.    No, I did not.
 3          Q.    Next let's look at the next
 4   column Arthur Moody joined 1935, engineer
 5   turbine department, De Laval Steam Turbine
 6   Company.  Did I read that correctly?
 7          A.    Yes.
 8          Q.    Did you know Mr. Arthur Moody?
 9          A.    No, I did not.
10          Q.    How about Arvid Peterson, 1921,
11   chief engineer, centrifugal pump and
12   compressor department, De Laval Steam Turbine
13   Company.  Did I read that correctly?
14          A.    Yes.
15          Q.    Did you know Mr. Arvid
16   Peterson?
17          A.    I didn't know him, no.
18          Q.    Did you know of him?
19          A.    I have seen his name somewhere
20   before.
21          Q.    Fair enough.  Let's look back
22   at there's a Robert Vogelsberg and then it
23   says J 1937, junior engineer, De Laval Steam
24   Turbine Company.  Did I read that correctly?
0084
 1          A.    Yes.
 2          Q.    Did you know Mr. Robert
 3   Vogelsberg?
 4          A.    No.
 5          Q.    Let's look at the next one
 6   Richard Waller, 1913, VP chief engineer, De
 7   Laval Steam Turbine Company.  Did you know
 8   Mr. Richard or O. Richard Waller?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    Was he working there at the
11   time that you were working there?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    What was his position at the
14   company when you were there?
15          A.    I believe it's the same, he was
16   vice-president of engineering I believe.
17          Q.    Was he one of your bosses?
18          A.    Yes.
19          Q.    How long was he one of your
20   bosses?
21          A.    I think he retired the year I
22   joined the company or shortly thereafter.
23          Q.    Were you aware that Mr. Waller
24   was a member of The American Society of
0085
 1   Mechanical Engineers?
 2          A.    I don't believe that I was.
 3          Q.    Certainly doesn't surprise you?
 4          A.    Doesn't surprise me, no.
 5          Q.    Did you ever go to any
 6   conferences with Mr. Waller to your
 7   knowledge?
 8          A.    They rarely let a young guy
 9   like me go into his office.
10          Q.    Understood.  Next one is at the
11   very bottom there Herbert L. Watson and then
12   it says in parenthesis 1907, 1921, general
13   sales manager, De Laval Steam Turbine
14   Company.  Did I read that correctly?
15          A.    Yes.
16          Q.    Did you know Mr. Herbert
17   Watson?
18          A.    No.
19          Q.    Sir, if I counted it up
20   correctly, there were 13 employees of De
21   Laval Steam Turbine Company out of the
22   Trenton, New Jersey facility that are listed
23   in this publication as members of The
24   American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
0086
 1   Does that sound unusual to you?
 2          A.    No, not particularly.
 3          Q.    If we include the one from
 4   Lawrenceville in this publication at least as
 5   I found so far there are 14 members or
 6   employees of De Laval or IMO that were
 7   members of The American Society of Mechanical
 8   Engineers, true?
 9          A.    That's what this publication
10   says, yes.
11          Q.    If we looked through these
12   individuals and I read the dates as we were
13   going, some of the dates were 1935, 1936,
14   1937, 1939, 1935, 1937.  If those are the
15   dates when these individuals were members of
16   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
17   wouldn't you agree, sir, that it's likely
18   that they would have received these
19   publications in 1935 that indicated that
20   asbestos was hazardous?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
22          A.    Again, if that's what ASME was
23   doing in 1935 then yes, they would have
24   received them as members.
0087
 1          Q.    Same thing as it relates to
 2   1939, these individuals if this date here
 3   refers to the date when these people were
 4   members and there's people listed here in
 5   1939, wouldn't you agree it's likely that
 6   they would have received the publications of
 7   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers
 8   including the one we marked as Exhibit 6 in
 9   1939?
10                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
11          A.    Subject to your qualification
12   there of the meaning of these numbers and the
13   fact that ASME was distributing its
14   publication routinely to its members, yes.
15          Q.    Sir, you don't find it at all
16   surprising that there would have been 13 or
17   14 or even more De Laval employees that were
18   members of The American Society of Mechanical
19   Engineers in the 1930s, true?
20          A.    I don't -- what was the
21   question again?
22          Q.    You don't find it surprising at
23   all or even unusual that there would have
24   been 13 or 14 or even more employees of De
0088
 1   Laval who would have been members of The
 2   American Society of Mechanical Engineers in
 3   the 1930s, true?
 4          A.    I don't find it surprising, no.
 5          Q.    In fact, based on what you said
 6   that's completely consistent with the
 7   practice of De Laval when you were there
 8   namely that a portion of the individuals who
 9   were involved in engineering design of pumps
10   and turbines were members of The American
11   Society of Mechanical Engineers, true?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          A.    Yes, if they were mechanical
14   engineering graduates and had an interest in
15   a professional association, then they would
16   have most likely joined the ASME.
17          Q.    It's in fact likely that there
18   were in fact a number of De Laval employees
19   who were members of The American Society of
20   Mechanical Engineers throughout the 1930s,
21   true?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
23          and answered.
24          A.    Yes, based on this list I
0089
 1   agreed that there were.
 2          Q.    So it's likely that at least
 3   some of them would have received the 1935
 4   publication and the 1939 publication from The
 5   American Society of Mechanical Engineers, can
 6   we agree on that?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 8          A.    Again, if the ASME was
 9   distributing the publication routinely to
10   members, to all members, then yes.
11          Q.    You have no reason to believe
12   that they were not?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
14          A.    I don't know that they were or
15   were not in 1935, I wasn't around.
16          Q.    In 1960 you know that they did
17   distribute their publications to all of their
18   members?
19          A.    That's correct.
20          Q.    Do you know if 1960 was the
21   first year that they started doing that or
22   was that practice when you started?
23          A.    I don't know when they started
24   doing that.
0090
 1          Q.    They had started that before
 2   you were a member, true?
 3          A.    I don't know the answer to
 4   that.  I just know that they were doing it
 5   when I became a member in 1962.
 6                 MR. GREENSTONE: Fair enough.
 7          Let's go off the record.
 8                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
 9          11:39.  This ends tape one of the
10          videotape deposition of Richard M.
11          Salzmann.  We are off the record.
12                 (Recess taken.)
13                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
14          11:56.  This begins tape two of the
15          videotaped deposition of Richard M.
16          Salzmann.  We are on the record.
17          Q.    Mr. Salzmann, are you ready to
18   continue?
19          A.    Yes.
20          Q.    We've just been talking about
21   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers
22   and documents that were published by it and
23   individuals who were employees of De Laval
24   who were members of The American Society of
0091
 1   Mechanical Engineers.  Do you remember that
 2   line of questions?
 3          A.    Yes.
 4          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
 5   that certainly employees of De Laval would
 6   have had access to the publications of The
 7   American Society of Mechanical Engineers in
 8   the 1930s?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
10          and answered.
11          A.    I've answered that a number of
12   times and as I say depending on how the ASME
13   distributed its documents in the 1930s, yes.
14          Q.    My question is a little bit
15   different. I'm not asking if you in fact have
16   knowledge that they got the documents, but if
17   members of or employees of De Laval including
18   the vice-president of the company were
19   members of The American Society of Mechanical
20   Engineers in the 1930s, would you agree that
21   they at least had the ability to get
22   publications of The American Society of
23   Mechanical Engineers in the 1930s?
24                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
0092
 1          A.    Again, I don't know what access
 2   they may or may not have had in the 1930s.
 3          Q.    Sir, based on what you know
 4   about The American Society of Mechanical
 5   Engineers, what is the basis for your
 6   testimony that you don't know whether they
 7   would have had access to publications of The
 8   American Society of Mechanical Engineers?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
10          A.    I wasn't there in the 1930s.
11          Q.    Even though you were a member
12   of this organization for how many years?
13          A.    From 1962 until the present.
14          Q.    You have been a member of this
15   organization for over 40 years?
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    Has there ever been a time in
18   the 40 years that you have been a member of
19   The American Society of Mechanical Engineers
20   that they haven't made their publications
21   available to their members?
22          A.    Not while I have been a member,
23   no.
24          Q.    Sir, isn't it logical and
0093
 1   reasonable that in the 1930s these
 2   publications of The American Society of
 3   Mechanical Engineers would have been made
 4   available to the De Laval employees who were
 5   members at that time including the
 6   vice-president of the company?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
 8          asked and answered and based on his
 9          prior answers you are asking him to
10          speculate.
11          A.    What's logical and reasonable
12   may or may not be fact.  I don't know I'm
13   trying to tell you that what's happening in
14   the 1930s. I was born in 1942.
15          Q.    You can't testify as you sit
16   here today, sir, that De Laval employees did
17   not receive these publications of The
18   American Society of Mechanical Engineers in
19   the 1930s, correct?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
21          and answered.  Said he didn't know one
22          way or the other.
23          A.    That's right, I don't know.
24          Q.    You don't know?
0094
 1          A.    I don't know one way or the
 2   other.
 3          Q.    As you sit here today, you
 4   can't swear under oath as the corporate
 5   representative of IMO and De Laval Steam
 6   Turbine Company that the first time that IMO
 7   or De Laval learned about the dangers of
 8   asbestos was 1972; isn't that true?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
10          A.    To my knowledge based on
11   documents that I have seen, the first time
12   that we were aware of some specific problem
13   was in 1972.
14                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
15          non-responsive.
16          Q.    As the corporate representative
17   who's been designated as the person most
18   knowledgeable on the issue of when De Laval
19   knew about the dangers of asbestos, isn't it
20   true that you cannot swear under oath to this
21   jury that employees of De Laval were not
22   aware about hazards of asbestos as early as
23   the 1930s when these American Society of
24   Mechanical Engineers publications came out?
0095
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form
 2          and asked and answered.
 3          A.    I don't know what the
 4   individuals who were members of ASME knew or
 5   did not know in the 1930s.
 6          Q.    The answer to my question is
 7   you can't swear under oath that the first
 8   time IMO learned about the dangers of
 9   asbestos was 1972, true?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
11          that's not what he said.
12          A.    What I said was that in the
13   1930s I have no knowledge of what specific
14   individuals who are members of ASME knew or
15   did not know.
16          Q.    That's exactly --
17          A.    Individuals as opposed to the
18   company.
19          Q.    I didn't mean to interrupt you,
20   sir. That's exactly the point that I'm trying
21   to make, sir, which is why I've asked the
22   question that I've asked and I would like an
23   answer to the question that I've asked which
24   is we know that The American Society of
0096
 1   Mechanical Engineers was publishing
 2   information about the hazards of asbestos in
 3   the 1930s.  You cannot swear under oath on
 4   behalf of IMO or De Laval Steam Turbine
 5   Company that people at De Laval didn't know
 6   as early as the 1930s about the dangers of
 7   asbestos?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
 9          asked and answered.  In fact, he has
10          sworn under oath that they didn't
11          know.
12                 MR. GREENSTONE: Counsel,
13          please stop coaching the witness.  You
14          are allowed to say objection to form
15          under Massachusetts law.  That's a
16          point that's been made to me over and
17          over again by defense counsel many of
18          whom are probably on the phone.
19                 MR. COLAO: The only reason
20          that I'm making any comment is because
21          the question is being asked over and
22          over again.  At some point --
23                 MR. GREENSTONE: I still have
24          not gotten an answer to my question.
0097
 1                 MR. COLAO: I don't think you
 2          got the answer you wanted.  You got an
 3          answer.
 4                 MR. GREENSTONE: I got a
 5          non-responsive answer that I objected
 6          to.
 7                 MR. COLAO: I'll let him answer
 8          it again.
 9                 MR. GREENSTONE: Thank you.
10          Q.    Sir, isn't it accurate that
11   because you do not know whether IMO or De
12   Laval employees received publications in the
13   1930s or 40s that indicated that asbestos
14   could kill because you don't know that?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
16          Q.    You cannot swear under oath,
17   sorry, I have to finish my question.  I'll
18   re-ask it.
19                 MR. COLAO: I apologize.
20          Q.    You've testified that you don't
21   know what employees of De Laval received or
22   didn't receive in the 1930s and forties,
23   true?
24          A.    I said that, yes.
0098
 1          Q.    That's because you were not
 2   there, correct?
 3          A.    That's correct.
 4          Q.    But you are right now being
 5   produced as the corporate representative of
 6   IMO on the issue of when De Laval first
 7   learned about the dangers of asbestos,
 8   correct?
 9          A.    That's correct.
10          Q.    Isn't it accurate that because
11   you do not know what the De Laval employees
12   received in the 1930s and forties you cannot
13   swear under oath that they didn't know about
14   the dangers of asbestos as early as the 1930s
15   and forties?
16                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
17          A.    I can only tell you what I know
18   and based on what I know and what I have seen
19   documents in reference to, they learned and
20   took action in 1972.
21          Q.    Those are two different things,
22   right, when you learned and when you took
23   action, would you agree with me?
24          A.    Pardon me.
0099
 1          Q.    Wouldn't you agree with me that
 2   the two different things are when you learned
 3   and when you took action, correct?
 4          A.    Yes.
 5          Q.    The fact that De Laval took
 6   action in 1972, that fact in and of itself
 7   doesn't prove that De Laval didn't know about
 8   any dangers until 1972, would you agree with
 9   that?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection;
11          mischaracterizes his testimony.
12          A.    I think I said what the
13   documents that I have seen indicate is that
14   they learned and took action in 1972 and
15   thereafter.
16          Q.    Let's make sure that that's
17   clear for the ladies and gentlemen of the
18   jury.  What research did you do of historical
19   documents to determine what was being
20   published to De Laval or De Laval employees
21   prior to 1972?
22          A.    Personally I did none.
23          Q.    Didn't do anything?
24          A.    No.
0100
 1          Q.    Nothing at all?
 2          A.    I reviewed documents that were
 3   provided to me.
 4          Q.    By attorneys for De Laval?
 5          A.    That's correct.
 6          Q.    You were not provided nor did
 7   you look at publications from the 1930s,
 8   forties, fifties or sixties, true?
 9          A.    I did not.
10          Q.    You did not conduct any type of
11   independent research through De Laval's
12   library or their files if there is even one
13   to determine what publications they had in
14   their possession from earlier than 1972,
15   true?
16          A.    I didn't do any personal
17   research, no.
18          Q.    All you did was get documents
19   from attorneys for De Laval who told you that
20   De Laval didn't know until 1972?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
22          it's not what he said.
23          Q.    That's the basis of your
24   testimony, true?
0101
 1          A.    My testimony is based on the
 2   documents that I have seen from 1972.
 3          Q.    Those were documents that were
 4   hand picked and chosen by lawyers for De
 5   Laval, true?
 6                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 7          A.    To the best of my knowledge
 8   that's not true, they are whatever documents
 9   exist, all of whatever documents exist that
10   are relevant to these questions.
11          Q.    They certainly didn't show you
12   any publications of The American Society of
13   Mechanical Engineers, did they?
14          A.    Not that I recall, no.
15          Q.    They didn't show you any
16   membership rosters that indicated that the
17   vice-president of IMO was a member of The
18   American Society of Mechanical Engineers as
19   early as 1912, did they?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
21          A.    Not that I recall.
22          Q.    They didn't show you any trade
23   journals such as the Southern Power &
24   Industry that De Laval was listed as an
0102
 1   advertiser in, did they?
 2          A.    No.
 3          Q.    Even though you have not tried
 4   to find the documents from the 1930s, forties
 5   and fifties and sixties that may indicate
 6   that De Laval had earlier knowledge about the
 7   dangers of asbestos, you still feel
 8   comfortable testifying to this jury under
 9   oath that De Laval couldn't have known until
10   1972?
11                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
12          A.    Would you repeat the question.
13          Q.    Even though you conducted no
14   research to determine what documents were
15   available to De Laval in the 1930s, forties,
16   fifties or sixties, do you still feel
17   comfortable testifying on behalf of De Laval
18   that they couldn't have known that asbestos
19   was hazardous until 1972?
20                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
21          A.    I feel comfortable, yes.  I
22   have not done any personal research myself.
23          Q.    If you don't do any research,
24   sir, how do you really know whether it's
0103
 1   correct or not?
 2          A.    Just because I didn't
 3   personally do any research doesn't suggest
 4   that it has not been done.
 5          Q.    Wasn't done by you?
 6          A.    Wasn't done by me.
 7          Q.    Do you know who did the
 8   research?
 9          A.    No.
10          Q.    Whoever did it didn't give you
11   documents from the thirties, forties, fifties
12   and sixties?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection, asked
14          and answered.
15          A.    They did not, no.
16          Q.    The first time you knew about
17   these American Society of Mechanical
18   Engineers publications from the thirties that
19   indicated concerns with asbestos, that was
20   when I showed them to you today, true?
21          A.    I believe that's correct.
22          Q.    They don't cause you to change
23   your testimony at all about when De Laval
24   first could have potentially known about the
0104
 1   dangers of asbestos?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 3          and answered.  I'll let him answer it
 4          one more time.
 5          A.    I said it doesn't change my
 6   opinion about when I actually know that De
 7   Laval learned about the dangers.
 8          Q.    Does it change your testimony
 9   about when De Laval could have potentially
10   learned about the dangers?
11                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
12          A.    That's pure speculation, no.
13          Q.    Let's talk about what you have
14   testified about as it relates to De Laval's
15   knowledge.  As you and I discussed before you
16   said that it was the OSHA, the Occupational
17   Safety and Health Administration asbestos
18   regulations in 1972, that's the first thing
19   that put De Laval on notice; is that fair?
20          A.    I believe that's correct, yes.
21          Q.    Why was it that a federal
22   regulation relating to asbestos put De Laval
23   on notice about the hazards of asbestos?
24          A.    I don't understand that
0105
 1   question why was it.
 2          Q.    Sure, why is it just because
 3   the federal government passes a regulation
 4   that says asbestos is dangerous, why would
 5   that affect De Laval?
 6          A.    I'm searching for where you are
 7   trying to go here.
 8          Q.    I would like you to answer the
 9   question, sir?
10          A.    Would you ask it again?
11          Q.    Sure.  Why did the OSHA
12   regulations provide notice to De Laval that
13   there may be a concern with asbestos if you
14   know?
15          A.    It really affected the
16   customers who used our equipment in work
17   places and so a customer raised a question
18   about whether we would use a substitute for
19   asbestos because of those regulations.
20          Q.    You certainly agree that a
21   federal regulation relating to asbestos that
22   would affect your customers is the type of
23   information that would put De Laval on notice
24   that there may be a concern here?
0106
 1          A.    Yes.
 2          Q.    That's in fact what you
 3   testified did put De Laval on notice in 1972?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          Go ahead.
 6          Q.    Correct?
 7          A.    Yeah, yes, that's what raised
 8   the issue in 1972, yes.
 9          Q.    Sir, if there had been a
10   similar government regulation, federal
11   government regulation that was passed say 20
12   years before 1972 that also affected your
13   customers in the same way, would you agree
14   that that would also be something that would
15   have put De Laval on notice about the dangers
16   of asbestos?
17                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
18          A.    Yes, if it was something that
19   affected the use or sale of our equipment by
20   a customer, yes.
21          Q.    Sir, have you ever heard of the
22   Walsh Healey Act?
23          A.    I've heard the name.
24          Q.    What is the Walsh Healey Act if
0107
 1   you know?
 2          A.    I don't know.
 3          Q.    Do you know that the Walsh
 4   Healey Act was passed in the 1950s?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 6          and answered.
 7          Q.    If you know, sir?
 8          A.    Yes, I don't know.
 9          Q.    Where have you seen that
10   referenced, sir?
11          A.    On order cards for De Laval
12   equipment.
13          Q.    De Laval documents?
14          A.    They are -- well, they are
15   partially De Laval documents, yes.
16          Q.    What does that mean partially
17   De Laval documents?
18          A.    They may repeat information
19   that's provided by customers.
20          Q.    For example, if a particular
21   federal regulation or act was going to govern
22   or control a De Laval contract, it might
23   reference that in an order card?
24          A.    Yes.
0108
 1          Q.    In fact, you have seen that
 2   before, true?
 3          A.    Yes, I have.
 4          Q.    If we -- I don't want to
 5   belabor this point too much at this point,
 6   but I do want to show you what's been
 7   produced to me in this case as engineering
 8   department memorandum and I believe order
 9   cards for the De Laval turbines and pumps
10   that would have been on the WILLIS A LEE.
11   Have you seen such documents, sir?
12          A.    I have seen such documents,
13   yes.
14          Q.    Did you review documents
15   relating to what De Laval equipment was on
16   the WILLIS A LEE for this case?
17          A.    Yes, I did.
18          Q.    I apologize, I don't have two
19   copies of this.  I meant to bring two, but it
20   was kind of difficult and I'm going to show
21   you this document and I guess I could mark
22   the whole thing eventually, but I'm not going
23   to do it at this point.  Take a look at that
24   document just in its entirety for a second to
0109
 1   see if you've reviewed those documents in
 2   this case?
 3          A.    Yes, I believe I have.
 4          Q.    Is it accurate that the section
 5   of the documents that I have given you there
 6   are documents relating to the fuel oil
 7   service pumps and the main condensate pumps
 8   that -- let me ask the question again.  The
 9   documents that you are holding there relate
10   to the De Laval fuel oil service pumps and
11   turbines and De Laval main condensate pumps
12   that De Laval provided for use on the WILLIS
13   A LEE?
14          A.    Yes, they relate to the fuel
15   oil service pump drivers, not the pumps
16   themselves and the main condensate pumps
17   which on the WILLIS A LEE were motor driven.
18          Q.    Take a look at the documents
19   because there's some reference to the De
20   Laval fuel oil service pumps themselves as
21   well, is there not?
22          A.    Yes, you're correct.
23          Q.    Are those documents that set of
24   documents that we'll mark collectively, is
0110
 1   that a true and accurate copy of De Laval
 2   documents from De Laval files relating to
 3   pumps that were on the WILLIS A LEE?
 4          A.    Yes, it appears to be.
 5          Q.    Can I have the document back,
 6   sir.  I'm just going to turn to a page here.
 7   If we look at the page that has the IMO Bates
 8   number 123 on it relating again to the fuel
 9   oil service pumps and turbines, it says --
10   one of the first lines here on the page says
11   the Vincent Trammell Act and the Walsh Healey
12   Act apply to this contract.  Did I read that
13   correctly?
14          A.    Yes.
15          Q.    That was -- what's the date of
16   that contract if you know?
17          A.    Well, sometime prior to October
18   of 1949.
19          Q.    So there was something called
20   the Walsh Healey Act that governed De Laval's
21   contract as referenced in De Laval's document
22   in 1949'ish, true?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
24          A.    That's correct.
0111
 1                 MR. GREENSTONE: What's the
 2          basis of the objection?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Is the word
 4          governed.  It has a legal implication.
 5                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me see
 6          what language they use here.
 7          A.    It says applies.
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'll change my
 9          question.
10          Q.    I like that better.  Would you
11   agree, sir, that the Walsh Healey Act applied
12   in 1949 to the De Laval contract for the fuel
13   oil service pumps that would have been on the
14   WILLIS A LEE when my client was on that ship?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
16          According to those documents?
17          A.    Certainly the drivers, yes.
18          Q.    Have you ever read the Walsh
19   Healey Act, sir?
20          A.    No.
21          Q.    Do you know what the nature of
22   the Walsh Healey Act was?
23          A.    No, I do not.
24                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'm going to
0112
 1          show you the next document which is I
 2          believe Exhibit number 8 which is in
 3          fact not a very good copy of the Walsh
 4          Healey Act and it's from 1951 although
 5          it's incredibly hard to read on this
 6          particular publication, but that's
 7          what this publication is from.
 8                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 8,
 9          Safety and Health Standards, Walsh
10          Healey Public Contracts Act, marked
11          for Identification.)
12          Q.    Have you ever seen this
13   document before?   It's entitled Safety and
14   Health Standards Walsh Healey Public
15   Contracts Act?
16          A.    No, I haven't.
17          Q.    If we read the foreward on the
18   first page, the first tabbed page, read along
19   with me if you would, the Walsh Healey Public
20   Contract Act requires that contracts entered
21   into by the agency of the United States
22   Government for the manufacture or furnishing
23   of materials, supplies, articles and
24   equipment in any amount exceeding $10,000
0113
 1   must contain among other provisions a
 2   stipulation that no part of such contract
 3   will be performed nor will any of the
 4   materials, supplies, articles or equipment to
 5   be manufactured or furnished under said
 6   contract be manufactured or fabricated in any
 7   plants, factories, buildings, surroundings or
 8   under any working conditions which are
 9   insanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the
10   health and safety of employees engaged in the
11   performance of the contract.  Did I read that
12   correctly?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    The other part in the middle of
15   the page that I have highlighted says
16   changing industrial processes and materials
17   may introduce new safety and health hazards.
18   Let me start over in the middle of the page.
19                 MR. COLAO: Let me note a
20          continuing objection to questions
21          regarding this legal document that he
22          says he's never seen before and
23          testified that he knows nothing about.
24          I'll just leave it at that for now.
0114
 1          Q.    Fair enough.  Middle of the
 2   page says changing industrial processes and
 3   materials may introduce new safety and health
 4   hazards which require constant attention if a
 5   realistic preventative program is to be
 6   carried on.  Space limitations of this
 7   bulletin permit compilation only of those
 8   standards relating to safety and occupational
 9   health problems which are commonly met by
10   employers.  Did I read that correctly?
11          A.    Yes.
12          Q.    If you turn to I believe it's
13   what's entitled page 1, part one, Safety And
14   Health Programs Pay Dividends, it's tabbed I
15   believe.  Are you there, sir?
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    At the bottom you see it says
18   page 1?
19          A.    Yes.
20          Q.    At the top it says part one
21   Safety And Health Programs Pay Dividends and
22   the part that I've highlighted says hard,
23   cold statistics on industrial accidents in
24   the United States tell a tragic and revealing
0115
 1   story. These figures deal with the number of
 2   people killed and injured in industrial
 3   accidents. Sometimes figures are used to
 4   estimate the billions of dollars that are
 5   lost by management and by workers and
 6   families as a result of accidents and then
 7   continuing but there are no statistics on the
 8   human suffering, sorrow and misery which
 9   follow deaths and injuries into the homes of
10   American workers even though the human
11   tragedy which stalks after industrial
12   accidents affords the most compelling reasons
13   for intelligent safety programs. Did I read
14   that correctly?
15          A.    Yes.
16          Q.    Under B do you see there's a
17   section that says Management's Part In Health
18   And Safety?
19          A.    Yes.
20          Q.    It says safety work in industry
21   must begin at the top.  Since every kind of
22   work that men do involves some degree of
23   hazard, each produces its share on injuries,
24   but by the proper attention to safety almost
0116
 1   all injuries can be prevented in any kind of
 2   work and in any occupation.  Management's
 3   desire to eliminate injuries should be strong
 4   enough to make their prevention a vital part
 5   of all activities.  Prevention must receive
 6   continuous attention along with such matters
 7   as cost, quality and production.  Did I read
 8   that correctly?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    On the next page which is page
11   2 it's a continuation?
12                 MR. COLAO: David, are you
13          going to do anything more than just
14          continue to read from this act?
15                 MR. GREENSTONE: Yes.
16                 MR. COLAO: The point is aside
17          from the substantive reasons why these
18          questions are improper and the
19          procedural reasons stated before,
20          we're taking up a lot of time.
21          Certainly the document speaks for
22          itself and we'll stipulate that it
23          says whatever it says.  If you have
24          questions other than -- that relate to
0117
 1          -- that are other than reading to him
 2          what's in it, I would suggest that we
 3          move to those questions.  If it goes
 4          too long, I think I have a right at
 5          some point to cut this kind of
 6          questioning off.
 7                 MR. GREENSTONE: This is a
 8          trial preservation deposition for the
 9          jury in this case, number one.  Number
10          two, I'm entitled to my examination
11          and to lay a foundation for the
12          question that I'm asking. Without
13          reading the portions of the document I
14          cannot lay the foundation for the
15          question so I'm getting to it.
16                 MR. COLAO: I don't know how
17          you can lay a foundation for documents
18          that he can't lay for you.
19                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'm not going
20          to spell it out for you.  The contract
21          says the Walsh Healey Act applies and
22          clearly the Walsh Healey Act is
23          relevant and as it relates to
24          knowledge I believe it will be clearly
0118
 1          relevant.  If you want to take it up
 2          with the judge, be my guest.
 3          Q.    Page two, the top?
 4                 MR. COLAO: My objection
 5          stands.
 6                 MR. GREENSTONE: Fair enough.
 7          Q.    Page two, very briefly the more
 8   important definite things that management
 9   should do to prevent accidents may be set
10   down as follows and then number 7 indicates
11   train, educate and stimulate its employees to
12   follow safe methods of work and take a
13   sincere interest in the safety of themselves
14   and their fellow workers.   Did I read that
15   correctly, sir?
16          A.    Yes, you did.
17          Q.    Were you aware that any of
18   these statements appeared in the Walsh Healey
19   Act in the 1950s?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
21          and answered.
22          A.    I was not specifically aware of
23   what appeared in the Walsh Healey Act.
24          Q.    We do know, sir, just to make
0119
 1   sure there's no confusion for the record that
 2   the Walsh Healey Act applied to the contract
 3   for the turbines and pumps that De Laval was
 4   supplying to the WILLIS A LEE in this case?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
 6          A.    Based on what the order cards
 7   say, yes.
 8          Q.    So clearly De Laval would have
 9   known about the Walsh Healey Act at least as
10   early as 1950, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
12          A.    Again, I wasn't there, but I'm
13   sure they were aware of it if they put it in
14   the order card.
15          Q.    Fair enough and if we turn to
16   page 23 which are the last couple of pages
17   which I'll ask you about.  Are you there,
18   sir?
19          A.    Yes.
20          Q.    It says on section B,
21   Environmental Conditions and Personal
22   Services and then it says number one, control
23   of atmospheric contaminants, a, workers shall
24   not be exposed to concentrations of
0120
 1   atmospheric contaminants hazardous to health.
 2   The most recent values for maximum
 3   concentrations as recommended by the American
 4   Conference of Governmental Industrial
 5   Hygienists shall be used as a guide in
 6   appraising occupational health hazards and in
 7   evaluating controls.  Maximum concentrations
 8   shall not be used as the sole criterion for
 9   establishing evidence of hazard to health or
10   well being, but the evaluation of a possible
11   hazard shall also be the subject to other
12   pertinent factors such as the nature of the
13   contaminant and the frequency and duration of
14   exposure or clinical evidence of harmful
15   effects.  Did I read that correctly?
16          A.    Yes, it appears that you did.
17          Q.    It's information that De Laval
18   would have been aware of in 1950, true?
19                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
20          A.    Again, I wasn't there, but the
21   indication is yes.
22          Q.    The next section, section B
23   says control of atmospheric contaminants may
24   be accomplished by any of the following
0121
 1   methods and then it lists some things you and
 2   I have seen before in other publications.  It
 3   says substitution of a less toxic material
 4   for the material containing the work room
 5   atmosphere, number two, exhaust ventilation,
 6   number three, isolation, number four,
 7   enclosure of the operation, number five,
 8   change the process or operating method such
 9   as by wet methods, number six, increase the
10   general ventilation.  Did I read all of that
11   correctly?
12          A.    Yes, generally.
13          Q.    Again, De Laval would have
14   known in 1950 that those controls were being
15   recommended for hazardous operations?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
17                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me start
18          over.
19          Q.    You would agree, sir, based on
20   what you testified to that De Laval would
21   have known that those controls were being
22   recommended in 1950 for the control of
23   hazardous operations?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
0122
 1          Q.    True?
 2          A.    To the extent that the
 3   individuals knew about this act and what was
 4   in it, yes.
 5          Q.    We know they did know about it
 6   because they put it in their contract in
 7   1949?
 8          A.    They put it in the contract
 9   documents, yes.
10          Q.    Then it says on page 23 maximum
11   allowable concentrations threshold limit
12   values adopted April 1950 at Chicago,
13   Illinois, American Conference of Governmental
14   Industrial Hygienists and on the next page
15   there's a section entitled Mineral Dusts, do
16   you see that?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    It lists a number of dusts
19   including asbestos, correct?
20          A.    Yes.
21          Q.    Do you see the reference to
22   five there?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    So if you look, it's under a
0123
 1   section that's MPPCF, million particles per
 2   cubic foot; is that accurate?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 4          A.    If you say so.
 5          Q.    It says under mineral dust
 6   million particles per cubic foot of air?
 7          A.    Yes, I see that.
 8          Q.    In 1950 or '51 the Walsh Healey
 9   Act was indicating that the concentration of
10   asbestos in the air could not be higher than
11   five million particles per cubic foot of air,
12   did you know that?
13          A.    I did not.
14          Q.    You don't know how similar or
15   different this Walsh Healey Act is from the
16   OSHA regulations that were passed in 1972, do
17   you?
18          A.    I don't know personally, no.
19          Q.    You don't know whether OSHA
20   contains the same or virtually the same list
21   of controls as are listed here by the Walsh
22   Healey Act in 1951, do you?
23          A.    No, I do not.
24          Q.    You don't know whether OSHA
0124
 1   adopts a concentration for exposure to
 2   asbestos that's higher or lower than what's
 3   being adopted by the Walsh Healey Act in
 4   1951, do you?
 5          A.    I don't know that.
 6          Q.    So as you sit here today you
 7   really have no idea whether this document is
 8   substantially the same as the OSHA asbestos
 9   regulations in 1972 or not, do you?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
11          A.    I told you I had not read the
12   Walsh Healey Act and did not know.
13          Q.    We know that De Laval knew
14   about it in 1951, true?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
16          and answered.
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    So De Laval would have known
19   that the maximum allowable concentration for
20   asbestos would have been five million
21   particles per cubic foot of air in 1951,
22   true?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
24          A.    Presumably in their work place,
0125
 1   yes.
 2          Q.    De Laval would have known that
 3   workers shall not be exposed to
 4   concentrations of atmospheric contaminants
 5   hazardous to health, true?
 6          A.    If you are reading the words
 7   out of the document, I presume whoever read
 8   that document would have been aware of that.
 9          Q.    One of the things they are
10   listing is asbestos, true?
11          A.    Yes, it is.
12          Q.    Sir, if this document is from
13   1951 and we know that De Laval knew about
14   that document in 1949 because there's a De
15   Laval contract that references it, wouldn't
16   that indicate to you, sir, that De Laval in
17   fact knew of potential hazards of asbestos 21
18   years before 1972 at least?
19                 MR. COLAO: Same objection;
20          asked and answered.
21          A.    I presume they were aware of
22   this document, yes, and I believe they would
23   have addressed it.
24          Q.    But you have seen nothing, not
0126
 1   a single document that indicates that De
 2   Laval took any action regarding precautions
 3   relating to asbestos between the years 1951
 4   and 1972, true?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection.  Go
 6          ahead.
 7          A.    Not specifically related to
 8   asbestos.  There were all kinds of things
 9   done in the plant.
10                MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object to
11          the non-responsive portion.
12          Q.    You talked to me before we
13   talked about the difference between knowledge
14   and action and you indicated that you know
15   that De Laval first took action with respect
16   to asbestos in 1972, true?
17          A.    That's to the best of my
18   knowledge, correct.
19          Q.    That's because you indicated
20   that that's when you thought they first knew
21   about any potential hazards of asbestos,
22   true?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    Now it's absolutely clear that
0127
 1   De Laval actually knew of potential hazards
 2   of asbestos from the Walsh Healey Act at
 3   least 21 years earlier, true?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          A.    In their plant, yes, that they
 6   had to take precautions in their plant.
 7          Q.    Which would indicate that they
 8   knew that there were potential hazards of
 9   asbestos 21 years before you told the jury
10   that they knew, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
12          A.    Yes, again, this is an act that
13   I'm not sure who and what and when they knew.
14          Q.    Haven't we just looked at a
15   contract that showed the Walsh Healey Act
16   applied to the contract in this case in 1949?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    We know that the Walsh Healey
19   Act applied at least to some De Laval
20   contracts as early as 1949, true?
21          A.    That's correct.
22          Q.    So De Laval would have known
23   about the Walsh Healey Act at least as early
24   as 1949, true?
0128
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 2          and answered.
 3          A.    Yes.
 4          Q.    As the corporate representative
 5   of IMO and the person most knowledgeable on
 6   the issue of when De Laval first knew or
 7   potentially knew about the potential hazards
 8   of asbestos, would you now like to change
 9   your testimony as to when De Laval first
10   learned of potential hazards of asbestos?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
12          asked and answered.
13          A.    No, I'm not changing my
14   testimony.
15          Q.    Even though we've seen the
16   Walsh Healey Act that provided precautions to
17   be taken around asbestos dust in 1951 and we
18   know the Walsh Healey Act applied to De Laval
19   contracts in 1951, you are still sticking to
20   your testimony that De Laval could not have
21   known about the potential hazards of asbestos
22   until 1972?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
24          and answered.
0129
 1          Q.    Is that correct, sir?
 2          A.    What I said is that I have seen
 3   documents that indicate when and how De Laval
 4   learned of the dangers of asbestos.  I've
 5   testified about that.  That's what I know to
 6   the best of my knowledge.  I'm sure that De
 7   Laval believed at this time if the Walsh
 8   Healey Act applied that they were complying
 9   with the Walsh Healey Act.
10          Q.    De Laval would have known at
11   that time that there were hazards associated
12   with asbestos, true?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
14          A.    Again, I wasn't there, I don't
15   know.
16          Q.    Were you ever provided the
17   Walsh Healey Act by anyone at IMO or De
18   Laval?
19                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
20          and answered.  He said he never saw it
21          until today.
22          A.    No.
23          Q.    None of the attorneys ever said
24   that there's this Walsh Healey Act that also
0130
 1   may have applied and it talked about
 2   asbestos?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Same objection,
 4          same answer.
 5          A.    No.
 6                MR. GREENSTONE: Don't instruct
 7          him to give the same answer.
 8                 MR. COLAO: I'm sorry, I meant
 9          his prior answer applied.
10                 MR. GREENSTONE: That's a
11          clever technique, but I do think it's
12          improper.
13                 MR. COLAO: I wish I was smart
14          enough to use it as a technique.
15                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection,
16          witness gave the same answer.  You
17          know I'm kidding.  I hope the record
18          reflects that I'm kidding.
19          Q.    Sir, have you seen any
20   documents at all today as I have shown you
21   including the Southern Power & Industry
22   publications that De Laval is listed as an
23   advertiser in, The American Society of
24   Mechanical Engineer publications from the
0131
 1   1930s, the Walsh Healey Act that applied to
 2   the contract at issue in this case from the
 3   1950s, have you seen anything that causes you
 4   to think that perhaps De Laval had knowledge
 5   of potential hazards of asbestos prior to
 6   1972?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 8          and answered.
 9          A.    As I've said, I don't know what
10   specific knowledge anybody at De Laval had
11   prior to 1972.  I do know what they had, what
12   information they had and what actions they
13   took in 1972 and I believe the company has
14   always and would have at this time obeyed the
15   law and if they had not, they would not have
16   gotten contracts so I believe that their
17   customers believed that they were obeying the
18   law.
19                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
20          non-responsive.
21          Q.    I understand the nature of your
22   testimony, sir, you said you've only seen
23   documents from '72 so you can't testify about
24   what happened prior to that, but now we've
0132
 1   shown you documents from prior to 1972
 2   including the Walsh Healey Act.  Does that
 3   act, its existence, the fact that it's a
 4   federal regulation similar to OSHA that was
 5   20 years before OSHA, does that make you
 6   question your testimony about when IMO first
 7   knew about the dangers of asbestos?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 9          and answered. I don't know how many
10          times he has to answer the question.
11          I'll allow him to answer it one more
12          time and then I'll instruct him not to
13          answer the same question over and over
14          again.
15          A.    The answer is my previous
16   testimony stands.
17          Q.    As you sit here today under
18   oath on behalf of IMO and De Laval Steam
19   Turbine Company, you don't know one way or
20   the other if De Laval actually was familiar
21   with the contents of the Walsh Healey Act
22   including the provisions about asbestos,
23   fair?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
0133
 1          and answered.
 2          A.    I have said I don't know what
 3   they or anybody within the company knew or
 4   did not know since I wasn't there.
 5          Q.    As long as we're talking about
 6   what you can say verses what you can't say,
 7   if we are being fair, sir, wouldn't it be
 8   more accurate testimony to give to this jury
 9   to say you really don't know when IMO first
10   learned about the dangers of asbestos rather
11   than saying it was 1972?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
13          that's not his testimony.
14          A.    I've answered this enumerable
15   times and I will give you the same answer
16   again.  I believe that the documents speak
17   for themselves that I have seen and have been
18   produced to you or others I'm sure that
19   describe when and how De Laval first knew of
20   the dangers of asbestos.
21          Q.    You believe the documents speak
22   for themselves?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    I'll move on.  Let's talk about
0134
 1   the second thing that I wanted to talk to you
 2   about today and that's the issue of De Laval
 3   conduct.  Would you agree with me, sir, and I
 4   believe you have agreed with me in the past
 5   that if De Laval knew of a potential hazard
 6   with one of their products, in your opinion
 7   they should warn the consumer?
 8          A.    They should address the hazard
 9   in some way, eliminate it.
10          Q.    Fair enough.  There's lots of
11   different ways --
12          A.    There's lots of ways to address
13   the problem.
14          Q.    You would agree with me that
15   there's lots of different ways to address a
16   potential hazard, one of which might be to
17   warn the consumer?
18          A.    That's possible, yes.
19          Q.    The time for De Laval to have
20   warned of potential dangers if they
21   discovered it would have been at the time
22   they discovered them, true?
23          A.    Again, that depends on the
24   situation, but could be, yes.
0135
 1          Q.    Certainly if De Laval found out
 2   that there was a potential hazard with one of
 3   their products, the prudent thing would not
 4   be to wait many years before addressing that
 5   problem in some way, it would be to take
 6   action at that time, fair?
 7          A.    Again, there's many ways to
 8   address a problem.  I don't know all of them.
 9                MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object to
10          the non-responsive answer.
11          A.    Or what should have been done.
12          Q.    That really wasn't my question.
13   My question was a little bit different. My
14   question is and I used your terminology if De
15   Laval learned of a potential hazard with
16   their product, the time to address that
17   hazard would have been at the time they
18   discovered there might be a problem, true?
19          A.    That's generally true, yes.
20          Q.    We've established before and I
21   don't want to retread, but we established
22   that De Laval made and sold products with
23   asbestos components for more than 50 years,
24   true?
0136
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 2          and answered, but go ahead.
 3          A.    I hope you were not saying that
 4   we made -- we did not manufacture any
 5   products that contained asbestos.
 6          Q.    Let me back up and let me
 7   re-ask the question.  Would you agree and we
 8   established, sir, that De Laval made and sold
 9   products that had asbestos components for
10   more than 50 years?
11          A.    From time to time, yes.
12          Q.    De Laval sold at least on
13   occasion thermal insulation products for more
14   than 40 years?
15          A.    Yes, when it was specified that
16   De Laval supply and furnish it on a piece of
17   equipment, we did that.
18          Q.    De Laval sold gaskets and
19   packing that contained asbestos for more than
20   50 years, true?
21          A.    That we bought from third
22   parties, yes.
23          Q.    Isn't it accurate, sir, that
24   for the entire time that De Laval sold
0137
 1   products that contained asbestos or sold
 2   asbestos products, De Laval never once warned
 3   regarding the dangers of asbestos?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          Go ahead.
 6          A.    Not that I'm specifically aware
 7   of.
 8          Q.    As you sit here today, you have
 9   not seen anything to indicate that De Laval
10   ever warned about the hazards of asbestos for
11   any of the products that they sold that
12   contained asbestos or any of the products
13   that they sold that contained asbestos
14   components, true?
15          A.    I'm not aware of any that we
16   did or that the company was aware of a need
17   to.
18          Q.    In fact, you know that De Laval
19   did not warn ever about the dangers of
20   asbestos, true?
21          A.    I have not seen any documents
22   that suggest that they have.
23          Q.    You haven't seen any documents
24   that suggest that they ever warned, true?
0138
 1          A.    That's correct.
 2          Q.    I have to break it down like
 3   this for a variety of reasons and I certainly
 4   don't mean to be duplicative, but you have
 5   not seen any indication -- strike that.
 6                De Laval never warned about the
 7   dangers of asbestos in the 1930s, true?
 8          A.    Not that I'm aware of.
 9          Q.    De Laval never warned about the
10   dangers of asbestos in the 1940s, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
12          He said they never ever learned so it
13          would --
14                 MR. GREENSTONE: Right, but
15          then you are going to object at trial
16          to me talking about never warning
17          because of post exposure stuff and
18          I'll argue the other side of it.
19                 MR. COLAO: why don't you just
20          ask him whether they warned between
21          the thirties and the eighties?
22                 MR. GREENSTONE: That's what
23          I'm doing here.
24                 MR. COLAO: No, you're not.
0139
 1                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'm breaking
 2          it down by decade so I could use it
 3          whenever.  If you want to withdraw
 4          that objection to post exposure
 5          testimony, I'll be happy to just ask
 6          the question that I asked and let's
 7          go.
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection stands.
 9          You can answer the questions.
10          Q.    Did De Laval ever warn
11   regarding the dangers of asbestos in the
12   forties?
13          A.    Not that I'm aware of.
14          Q.    Did De Laval ever warn
15   regarding the dangers of asbestos in the
16   fifties?
17          A.    Not that I'm aware of.
18          Q.    Did De Laval ever warn
19   regarding the dangers of asbestos in the
20   sixties?
21          A.    Not that I'm aware of.
22          Q.    Did De Laval ever warn
23   regarding the dangers of asbestos in the
24   seventies?
0140
 1          A.    Not that I'm aware of.  I don't
 2   know.
 3          Q.    In terms of technical manuals
 4   or instruction books that De Laval put out,
 5   as you sit here today, you have never seen
 6   any warning regarding the dangers of asbestos
 7   present in any De Laval technical manual or
 8   instruction book, true?
 9          A.    Not that I recall.
10          Q.    Even after the OSHA regulations
11   were passed in 1972, the thing that you said
12   put De Laval on notice of potential hazards
13   for asbestos, even after that happened, De
14   Laval continued to sell products with
15   asbestos components until the 1980s, true?
16          A.    They sold products like packing
17   and gaskets on occasion in those periods.
18          Q.    They still sold pumps with
19   asbestos components and turbines with
20   asbestos components, true, after 1972?
21          A.    Yes.
22          Q.    They did that until the 1980s,
23   true?
24          A.    Yes.
0141
 1          Q.    Even after 1972 when you've
 2   testified that De Laval had actual knowledge
 3   that asbestos could potentially harm human
 4   beings, De Laval still never provided any
 5   warnings regarding the dangers of asbestos on
 6   any of the products that they sold that
 7   contained asbestos or asbestos components,
 8   true?
 9          A.    Yes, we were not aware of any
10   danger from those particular components i.e.
11   asbestos gaskets and packing.
12          Q.    But even after 1972 De Laval
13   did not warn regarding the dangers of
14   asbestos, true?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          A.    Because to our knowledge there
17   was none.
18                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
19          non-responsive.
20          Q.    Sir, did I ask you about
21   whether you thought there was a hazard at
22   that point to your products?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
24                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'm wondering
0142
 1          if he misunderstood my question.
 2          A.    I was trying to give you a
 3   correct answer.
 4          Q.    I understand what you were
 5   trying to do, sir. I would like you to answer
 6   the question that I'm asking. The question
 7   that I asked was after 1972 you would agree
 8   with me that De Laval still sold products
 9   that contained asbestos components, but did
10   not warn regarding the dangers of asbestos,
11   true?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to the
13          term products.
14          A.    The answer was we were not
15   aware of any need to warn.
16          Q.    You did not warn?
17                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object
18          to non-responsive.
19          A.    We did not warn and we knew of
20   no reason to.
21          Q.    After 1972 De Laval did not
22   warn, true?
23          A.    Because we had no reason to.
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
0143
 1                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection to
 2          the non-responsive portion.  I'll go
 3          to the judge and force an answer to
 4          the question, sir, that's not
 5          non-responsive.
 6                 MR. COLAO: I think he gave an
 7          answer.
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: He's giving
 9          the answer that you would like him to
10          give.
11                 MR. COLAO: There's no reason
12          for you to go to the judge.  He gave
13          an answer.
14                 MR. GREENSTONE: No, he hasn't.
15          He has given your answer, not the
16          actual answer.  I'm entitled to an
17          answer to my question.
18                 MR. COLAO: Just as you invited
19          me, I'll give you the same invitation
20          to go to the judge.
21                 MR. GREENSTONE: Fair enough.
22          Q.    Sir, it's accurate that even
23   after De Laval had actual knowledge that
24   asbestos could pose potential health hazards
0144
 1   to human beings they still sold products that
 2   contained asbestos components and they never
 3   provided any warnings at all to people
 4   purchasing those products, true?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 6          and answered.
 7          A.    Yes, we knew of no reason to
 8   warn for those particular products.
 9                MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object to
10          the non-responsive portions.
11          Q.    Sir, do you remember giving
12   testimony on January 18, 2007?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    I was actually asking questions
15   at that time?
16          A.    Yes, was it you at that time?
17          Q.    It was me and you gave complete
18   and accurate information to the questions
19   that I asked at least as far as you know?
20          A.    To the best of my knowledge.
21          Q.    I want to show you that
22   testimony from page 323. The question was
23   asked exactly as I just asked it.  It's
24   accurate that even after De Laval had actual
0145
 1   knowledge that asbestos could pose potential
 2   health hazards to human beings, they still
 3   sold products that contained asbestos
 4   components and they never provided any
 5   warnings at all to people purchasing those
 6   products, true, and what was your answer to
 7   that question at line 6, sir?
 8          A.    I'm not aware of any.
 9          Q.    Thank you, sir.  Sir, you've
10   indicated that De Laval didn't think there
11   was a need to warn about their products,
12   true?
13          A.    Not -- which products, about
14   their products.
15          Q.    Yes, sir.
16          A.    The company's products.
17          Q.    Yes, sir.
18          A.    Yes, that's correct.
19          Q.    Can you name for me, sir, list
20   for me all of the tests and studies that De
21   Laval conducted to determine whether there
22   were any hazards of asbestos relating to
23   their products?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection to the
0146
 1          term their products.
 2          A.    Yes, that's a
 3   mischaracterization.  They were other
 4   people's products that contained asbestos.
 5                 MR. GREENSTONE: Again, if you
 6          are coaching the witness with your
 7          objection, that's ridiculous and it's
 8          improper and it's not the question
 9          that I asked, Counselor.
10                 MR. COLAO: What I was trying
11          to do was to give you a basis as to
12          why I was objecting to the question so
13          if you wanted to remove the objection
14          you could make it more specific.
15                 MR. GREENSTONE: Fair enough.
16          Q.    Sir, can you list for me every
17   test that De Laval conducted to determine
18   potential hazards of asbestos?
19          A.    I'm not aware of any.
20          Q.    Didn't you just testify, sir,
21   that De Laval didn't have a reason to believe
22   that their particular products that had
23   asbestos components posed a health hazard?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection;
0147
 1          argumentative.  It's what he testified
 2          to.
 3          Q.    Is that what you testified to,
 4   sir?
 5          A.    Yes.
 6          Q.    You testified to that yet De
 7   Laval conducted no studies or tests to
 8   determine if there were health hazards from
 9   their products that had asbestos components?
10                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
11          A.    The components of the products
12   that contained the asbestos were purchased
13   from third party companies who we relied on
14   to provide functional safe products.
15          Q.    It's accurate, sir, is it not
16   that De Laval never conducted any tests or
17   any studies at all to determine the hazards
18   associated with asbestos or any asbestos
19   product or component, true?
20                 MR. COLAO: David, he answered
21          that question.
22          A.    Not to the best of my
23   knowledge, no.
24          Q.    Would you agree with me --
0148
 1   well, there's a double negative there in the
 2   answer.  It's accurate that De Laval never
 3   conducted any tests or studies to determine
 4   potential hazards of asbestos or asbestos
 5   components, true?
 6          A.    Nor knew of any reason to.
 7          Q.    De Laval didn't know of any
 8   reason to test their products, sir, is that
 9   what you just testified to this jury?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
11          A.    No, you're distinguishing
12   between the De Laval products and the
13   components that we bought from third party
14   companies that would have been tested if at
15   all by those companies.
16          Q.    I'll get there, sir and I would
17   like an answer to my question which was as
18   you sit here today, is it accurate that De
19   Laval never conducted any tests or studies to
20   determine potential health hazards of
21   asbestos or asbestos components?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
23          and answered.
24          A.    No, they were not products we
0149
 1   manufactured and therefore had no need to.
 2          Q.    So you never did any tests?
 3          A.    We never did any tests that I'm
 4   aware of.
 5          Q.    You mentioned that these were
 6   products manufactured by third parties.  It's
 7   also true you are not aware of De Laval
 8   actually ever asking any of these third party
 9   manufacturers of asbestos products whether
10   there were any hazards associated with those
11   products?
12          A.    Not until we learned of the
13   potential in 1972.
14          Q.    At that point it's your
15   testimony that De Laval asked the
16   manufacturers of the products that were
17   asbestos about the dangers of them?
18                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
19          A.    The products that were at issue
20   at that time or were believed to pose a
21   potential hazard, yes.
22          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
23   prior to 1970 De Laval never once asked any
24   manufacturer of the third party products that
0150
 1   were asbestos containing about any hazards
 2   associated with their products?
 3          A.    I'm not aware of any.
 4          Q.    De Laval conducted no dust
 5   release studies relating to asbestos
 6   components of their equipment, true?
 7          A.    Not that I'm aware of.
 8          Q.    It's accurate that De Laval
 9   didn't conduct any type of literature
10   research or records review to try to
11   determine whether there was any hazards
12   associated with the components that had
13   asbestos in De Laval's equipment, true?
14          A.    Not that I'm aware of.  I don't
15   know.
16          Q.    You would agree, sir, that De
17   Laval never provided any warnings to the
18   sailors that were aboard the WILLIS A LEE
19   regarding the dangers of asbestos components
20   in their equipment?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
22          A.    Not that I'm aware of.
23                 MR. COLAO: Do you want to take
24          a lunch break?
0151
 1                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me just
 2          finish this.
 3          Q.    De Laval never provided any
 4   warnings to the Carolina Eastman facility
 5   regarding dangers of asbestos components in
 6   their equipment, true?
 7          A.    I'm not aware that we sold
 8   anything to Carolina Eastman company.
 9          Q.    Did De Laval ever provide any
10   warnings to Daniel Construction regarding the
11   dangers of asbestos?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
13          A.    Daniel Construction?
14          Q.    Yes, sir?
15          A.    I'm not aware that we sold
16   anything to Daniel Construction either.
17          Q.    Do you know if De Laval ever
18   provided any warnings to Daniel Construction
19   regarding the dangers of asbestos?
20          A.    If we sold them no equipment,
21   no.
22          Q.    Would you agree, sir, that De
23   Laval could have warned about the dangers of
24   asbestos had they wanted to?
0152
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection; calls
 2          for speculation.
 3          A.    I would say that it's possible
 4   that they could have warned had they been
 5   aware that there was a need to.
 6          Q.    You have not seen any
 7   government or Naval code or rule or
 8   regulation or specification that would have
 9   ever prevented De Laval from warning
10   regarding the dangers of asbestos, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
12          A.    Only the government's approval
13   right over everything we did, but other than
14   that, no, I have not seen any specific
15   regulation.
16          Q.    Even in light of the
17   government's approval right, you are not
18   aware of any code, regulation, specification
19   or anything from the government that would
20   have prevented De Laval from warning
21   regarding the dangers of asbestos, true?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
23          A.    No, if we had been aware of a
24   need to, I haven't seen any regulation
0153
 1   preventing that.
 2          Q.    You know of nothing that would
 3   give you a colorable argument that the Navy
 4   would have prevented any warnings regarding
 5   the dangers of asbestos had De Laval chosen
 6   to warn regarding the dangers of asbestos?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Objection and may
 8          be getting outside the scope of the
 9          notice and his knowledge, but go
10          ahead.
11          A.    You used a word in there that I
12   didn't understand. Would you repeat the
13   question, please.
14          Q.    Sure.  You know of nothing that
15   would give you any type of colorable argument
16   that the Navy would have prevented any
17   warning regarding the dangers of asbestos?
18          A.    What's colorable?
19          Q.    Reasonable argument?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
21          A.    Could you repeat the question
22   again, please?
23          Q.    You know of nothing that would
24   give you any type of colorable argument that
0154
 1   the Navy would have prevented De Laval from
 2   warning regarding the dangers of asbestos,
 3   true?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 5          A.    Not if they or we saw a need to
 6   do so, no.
 7          Q.    You're not aware of any
 8   instance when the Navy prevented De Laval
 9   from warning about anything, true?
10                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
11          A.    I don't know.
12          Q.    Not aware of any such instance
13   as you sit here today?
14          A.    No.  That's not to say it
15   didn't occur.
16          Q.    You don't know of any?
17          A.    I don't know of any specific
18   instance.
19          Q.    You're aware of nothing that
20   indicates to you that De Laval didn't warn
21   regarding the dangers of asbestos because
22   they were directed not to warn by the federal
23   government or an officer of the federal
24   government?
0155
 1                 MR. COLAO: Same asked and
 2          answered, same question.
 3          A.    I don't know of any specific
 4   instance, no.
 5          Q.    You're not aware of any -- this
 6   was broader than just a specific instance.
 7   You are not aware of anything, any
 8   information at all that would indicate to you
 9   that De Laval didn't warn regarding asbestos
10   because they were directed not to warn by any
11   officer of the federal government or the
12   federal government itself?
13                 MR. COLAO: It's the same
14          question and I'm going to direct him
15          not to answer where it's the same
16          exact question now twice.  I think I
17          have been overly liberal.
18                 MR. GREENSTONE: He didn't
19          answer it the first time.  He asked me
20          to clarify it which is why I asked it
21          again.
22                 MR. COLAO: He did.
23                 MR. GREENSTONE: You know why I
24          have to ask the question.  I've worded
0156
 1          the question in a way that's not been
 2          asked before specifically talking
 3          about officers of the federal
 4          government.  You know exactly why I'm
 5          asking it.  He's entitled to answer it
 6          and I'm entitled to get an answer to
 7          the question.
 8                 MR. COLAO: I'm not so sure
 9          that you are right, but I'll let him
10          do it.
11          Q.    You are aware of nothing that
12   would -- no information at all that would
13   indicate to you that De Laval didn't warn
14   regarding the dangers of asbestos because
15   they were directed not to warn by any officer
16   of the federal government, true?
17          A.    Again, I can't know that with
18   any degree of accuracy, but I know of no
19   specific instance where that occurred.
20          Q.    Do you believe it was
21   responsible for De Laval to never warn
22   regarding the dangers of asbestos for the
23   more than 50 years that they sold products
24   that had asbestos components?
0157
 1          A.    To the best of my knowledge, De
 2   Laval acted responsibly as long as I was with
 3   the company and if they felt that there was a
 4   need to warn or take action of any kind,
 5   their response was generally that they did
 6   so.
 7          Q.    Isn't it accurate, sir, that
 8   you have seen nothing that indicates that De
 9   Laval was concerned at all about the safety
10   of individuals who were using asbestos
11   components of De Laval products?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          A.    Would you repeat that question?
14          Q.    Sure.  You have seen nothing
15   that would indicate to you that De Laval was
16   concerned at all about the safety of people
17   who were using asbestos components of De
18   Laval products?
19                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
20          A.    What I have seen is all kinds
21   of indications that De Laval didn't believe
22   there was any danger associated with those
23   asbestos products that it used when they used
24   them.
0158
 1                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
 2          non-responsive.
 3          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
 4   that you have seen no documents or any other
 5   evidence that would indicate to you that De
 6   Laval was concerned about the safety of
 7   individuals who would be using asbestos
 8   gaskets and packing or any other asbestos
 9   component that might have been used with a De
10   Laval product?
11          A.    I think I'll leave my answer
12   stand in terms of the asbestos and packing --
13   gaskets and packing.
14          Q.    What's your answer, sir?
15          A.    The same as I gave there.
16          Q.    I'm asking you the question.  I
17   haven't showed you the testimony yet.  I'm
18   asking you a question.
19                 MR. COLAO: Maybe you should.
20          If you will read, you probably should
21          show it to him.
22          A.    I would like to see it.
23                 MR. COLAO: It's not a game.
24                 MR. GREENSTONE: It's only
0159
 1          impeachment if he disagrees with it.
 2          I only need to impeach him if he
 3          disagrees with it.  That's law school
 4          101.  I don't mean to lecture, but I'm
 5          asking the question to see if he gives
 6          the same answer.
 7                 MR. COLAO: I don't think it
 8          was a lecture, there's no need to
 9          apologize.  I think though he did
10          answer the question and you were
11          impeaching him and if you are, show
12          him the question and answer, this way
13          he does not have to guess.
14                 MR. GREENSTONE: I know that
15          until he disagreed with it it's not
16          improper impeachment and you will
17          object to it later when I try to
18          designate the page and lines.  There's
19          a proper way to do it which is what
20          I'm trying to do.
21                 MR. COLAO: I thought you did
22          it properly.
23          Q.    Have you seen any documents or
24   any other evidence that would indicate to you
0160
 1   that De Laval was concerned about the safety
 2   of individuals who would be using asbestos
 3   gaskets and packing that played some role in
 4   stopping their use of asbestos gaskets and
 5   packing?
 6          A.    No, I have not.
 7          Q.    Sir, if De Laval had received
 8   the Southern Power & Industry documents that
 9   talked about asbestos being toxic or The
10   American Society of Mechanical Engineers
11   documents that talked about asbestos being
12   potentially hazardous or the Walsh Healey Act
13   that indicated precautions that needed to be
14   taken around asbestos and other dust, if they
15   had gotten those documents in those time
16   periods, the thirties, forties and fifties,
17   do you still believe it was reasonable for De
18   Laval to never warn about the dangers of
19   asbestos?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection; calls
21          for speculation, asked and answered.
22          You can answer it again.
23          A.    The fact that they did not
24   suggests quite clearly that they did not see
0161
 1   a danger or a need to warn and therefore did
 2   not.
 3                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
 4          non-responsive.
 5                 MR. COLAO: I don't know about
 6          that.
 7          Q.    My question was if De Laval had
 8   received documents in the thirties, forties
 9   and fifties indicating that asbestos was
10   hazardous, do you still believe as the
11   corporate representative of De Laval that it
12   was reasonable for them to never warn
13   regarding the dangers of asbestos?
14                 MR. COLAO: Same objection. You
15          are asking him to speculate.
16          A.    I believe that as a result of
17   the evidence that they did not warn that
18   there was no perceived need to based on
19   whatever knowledge they had at that time
20   which I'm not aware of.
21                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection,
22          non-responsive.  This is as good a
23          place as any to take a break.

 7   CONTINUED EXAMINATION
 8   BY MR. GREENSTONE:
 9                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
10          2:01.  This begins tape three of the
11          videotaped deposition of Richard M.
12          Salzmann.  We are on the record.
13          Q.    Mr. Salzmann, we're back after
14   a lunch break.  Are you ready to continue?
15          A.    Yes.
16          Q.    Okay, great.  It was a good
17   breaking point.  I'm now up to my third area
18   of inquiry that I wanted to talk to you about
19   which is dealing with De Laval pumps and
20   turbines and their asbestos components and
21   asbestos insulation, okay?
22          A.    Okay.
23          Q.    As a general principal it's
24   correct, is it not, that De Laval pumps and
0164
 1   turbines contained asbestos components at the
 2   time they left the De Laval manufacturing
 3   facility, true?
 4          A.    Those that contained those
 5   components, it was the general practice to
 6   send or to ship a complete product.
 7          Q.    The complete product would
 8   include whatever asbestos components were
 9   included if any, true?
10          A.    That's correct.
11          Q.    That has been the case namely
12   that De Laval would ship their pump or
13   turbine with asbestos components if any
14   during the entire time that De Laval had sold
15   pumps and turbines with asbestos components,
16   true?
17          A.    Well, now you are getting into
18   infinite time periods again.  To the best of
19   my knowledge that's correct.  There were
20   occasions I'm sure where machines or parts of
21   machines were shipped individually.
22          Q.    Is it accurate that De Laval
23   pumps and turbines contained asbestos
24   packing?
0165
 1          A.    Some pumps did and some
 2   turbines did.
 3          Q.    As it relates to De Laval fuel
 4   oil service pumps, is it accurate that they
 5   always would have contained asbestos packing?
 6          A.    In general the pumps did not
 7   contain asbestos packing.
 8          Q.    As it relates to fuel oil
 9   service pumps, is it accurate that the
10   turbine drivers of the pumps contained
11   asbestos packing?
12          A.    With respect to what kind of
13   machines?
14          Q.    Fuel oil service pumps?
15          A.    Fuel oil service pumps in
16   general there were pieces of packing which
17   may have contained asbestos around the valve
18   stems.
19          Q.    I think I didn't ask a complete
20   question and I wanted to come back and do it.
21   Is it accurate that the De Laval turbines
22   that drove the De Laval fuel oil service
23   pumps generally contained asbestos packing?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
0166
 1          Go ahead.
 2          A.    Many of them did again in the
 3   valve stems as I mentioned.
 4          Q.    Have you ever seen
 5   specifications for De Laval fuel oil service
 6   pumps or the De Laval turbines that drove
 7   fuel oil service pumps that specified non
 8   asbestos packing for the turbine?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
10          Go ahead.
11          A.    I can't recall that I have in
12   that particular circumstance.
13          Q.    You have not seen any instance
14   that you could recall where a De Laval
15   turbine driver of a fuel oil service pump had
16   anything other than asbestos packing, fair?
17          A.    That's correct.
18          Q.    Would there be any asbestos
19   gaskets associated with De Laval fuel oil
20   service pumps or their turbine drivers to
21   your knowledge?
22          A.    No, not with respect to either
23   the pump or the turbine to my knowledge.
24          Q.    You believe that -- thanks.  As
0167
 1   it relates to the De Laval lube oil service
 2   pumps, is it accurate that the turbine
 3   drivers of De Laval lube oil service pumps
 4   came with asbestos packing?
 5          A.    Again, in the valve stems to
 6   the best of my knowledge that's generally
 7   true.
 8          Q.    As you sit here today, are you
 9   aware of any instances in which the turbine
10   drivers of the De Laval lube oil service
11   pumps did not contain asbestos packing?
12          A.    I can't recall a specific
13   instance where they did not again in that
14   location.
15          Q.    So at least to your knowledge
16   and recollection and your experience with De
17   Laval, the turbines that drove the De Laval
18   fuel oil service pumps and lube oil service
19   pumps came with asbestos packing at least as
20   far as you know?
21          A.    We're talking generally now?
22          Q.    Yes, sir.
23          A.    Generally that's true.
24          Q.    Again, just to make sure it's
0168
 1   clear for the record, that packing was a
 2   component of those turbines at the time they
 3   left the De Laval manufacturing facility,
 4   true?
 5          A.    They would have been assembled
 6   into the turbine buried in around the valve
 7   stem to seal it.
 8          Q.    Just to make sure, I apologize,
 9   I don't mean to be repetitive here, I really
10   don't.  Sometimes I do, but now I don't.  As
11   it relates to the asbestos packing in De
12   Laval turbines in the valve stems as you've
13   indicated, that asbestos packing was
14   contained within the De Laval turbine at the
15   time that it left the De Laval manufacturing
16   facility, true?
17          A.    That's generally true, yes.
18          Q.    Did De Laval main condensate
19   pumps have any asbestos components to your
20   knowledge?
21          A.    I recall from the specific
22   machines that were aboard the WILLIS LEE that
23   there is a gasket which is asbestos
24   containing.
0169
 1          Q.    Do you know how many asbestos
 2   gaskets were in the De Laval main condensate
 3   pumps?
 4          A.    One I believe.
 5          Q.    De Laval also sold main
 6   reduction gears; is that accurate?
 7          A.    Yes.
 8          Q.    Do you know if there were any
 9   asbestos components in main reduction gears?
10          A.    At times.
11          Q.    What asbestos components would
12   be in main reduction gears?
13          A.    There may have been on those
14   gears which had a small instrument in the
15   casing or the bracket to measure shaft
16   position; that instrument was generally
17   sealed with packing.
18          Q.    That generally would have been
19   asbestos packing?
20          A.    More often than not, yes.
21          Q.    There were times when De Laval
22   sold turbine drivers for other companies
23   pumps; is that fair?
24          A.    For ship board service for the
0170
 1   Navy?
 2          Q.    Sure.
 3          A.    They may have.  I can't
 4   remember a specific instance of that.
 5          Q.    For example, De Laval sold
 6   turbines that drove fire pumps for the United
 7   States Navy, true?
 8          A.    I don't know.
 9          Q.    Are you familiar with De Laval
10   turbines that drive fire pumps?
11          A.    Not specifically, no.  I would
12   need to look at -- that's a -- that's not one
13   I run into very often.
14          Q.    Do you know if they would have
15   had -- those particular turbines would have
16   had any asbestos components?
17          A.    No, I don't.
18          Q.    You don't know one way or the
19   other?
20          A.    No.
21          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
22   that De Laval knew at the time they sold
23   pumps that had asbestos components that on
24   occasion those asbestos components may have
0171
 1   to be changed out and replaced?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 3          A.    It was a part that was spared
 4   so on occasion that's possible.
 5          Q.    I want to make sure that I
 6   understand your testimony.  It is true, is it
 7   not, that De Laval knew that the asbestos
 8   packing in their turbines would on some
 9   occasions have to be changed out and
10   replaced, true?
11          A.    They certainly knew that it was
12   possible that it would have to be changed out
13   and replaced, yes.
14          Q.    The only problem I'm having
15   with your answer is the qualification that it
16   was possible.  I want to show you your
17   testimony again from the Merrill case, page
18   405, line 17.  You were asked De Laval would
19   have known that the asbestos packing on their
20   turbines would on some occasions have to be
21   changed out and replaced, true, and your
22   answer at line 21 was what?
23          A.    My answer was yes and that was
24   probably a case where you elicited a simple
0172
 1   answer that was less than the proper
 2   characterization.
 3          Q.    In any event, De Laval -- I'll
 4   object to the non-responsive portions.  Is it
 5   accurate that in this testimony you gave just
 6   a few months ago you answered yes to the
 7   question would De Laval know that the packing
 8   in their turbines would have to be changed
 9   out and replaced?
10          A.    Yes, and I think the correct
11   answer is yes and it varied widely in terms
12   of when and how and why the packing would
13   have to be changed out.
14          Q.    No question, but it is likely
15   and De Laval knew that it was likely that at
16   some point during the life of the turbine
17   packing is going to have to be replaced?
18          A.    That's correct.
19          Q.    De Laval knew that it's
20   possible that some of that packing might be
21   wet and some of it might be dried out, true?
22                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
23          A.    I don't know what in that
24   period of time people anticipated.  Packing
0173
 1   is generally wet because its sealing either
 2   liquids or condensables so I'm not sure what
 3   those who were around in the forties or
 4   whenever anticipated.
 5          Q.    Certainly it's logical, isn't
 6   it, that they would know that if a turbine or
 7   pump had been out of service for a period of
 8   time and the packing had been sitting for a
 9   while it could dry out and have to be
10   replaced, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
12          A.    The packing would certainly be
13   dry if it was sitting for a long period of
14   time with no fluid in it.
15          Q.    De Laval would have known at
16   the time they sold their pumps and turbines
17   that the asbestos packing would likely have
18   to be replaced using a packing tool; is that
19   fair?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
21          I think as you get more specific with
22          these questions they are becoming more
23          speculative, but go ahead.
24          A.    I don't really know what kind
0174
 1   of tool they used back in those days.  I'm
 2   sure they didn't pick it out with their
 3   fingers.
 4          Q.    Fair enough.  I think as you
 5   articulated, but I wanted to make sure it's
 6   clear, one of the reasons that De Laval sold
 7   spares or made spares available of asbestos
 8   packing was because of their realization that
 9   at some point during the life of the pump and
10   turbine the packing would have to be
11   replaced, true?
12          A.    Yes, it was the customer's
13   realization or the customer's order that
14   included the spares, but that was typical of
15   the Navy's approach to things.
16          Q.    It was the customer that wanted
17   the spares and De Laval that made those
18   spares available to them and sold them,
19   correct?
20          A.    That's correct.
21          Q.    Sometimes De Laval would
22   actually sell replacement gaskets and packing
23   with the actual pump and turbine, true?
24          A.    That's correct.
0175
 1          Q.    Would you also agree that it
 2   was foreseeable to De Laval that at some
 3   point during the life of a pump a gasket may
 4   have to be changed out if there is a gasket?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 6          A.    Yes, less frequently, but yes.
 7          Q.    Let's talk for a few minutes
 8   about asbestos insulation.  Would you agree
 9   with me, sir, that on some of their pumps De
10   Laval knew that the turbine drivers of those
11   pumps would need to be insulated with
12   asbestos?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
14          A.    The word need is a
15   mischaracterization.  The turbines didn't
16   need to be insulated in order to run
17   properly, but there were times depending on
18   the service, depending on the ship for that
19   matter that I'm aware of where they would be
20   insulated I'm sure.
21          Q.    Let me ask a little bit of a
22   different question because of your
23   qualification.  It was foreseeable to De
24   Laval at the time they sold their pumps and
0176
 1   turbines to a customer including the United
 2   States Navy, it was foreseeable to them that
 3   some of those turbines would be insulated
 4   with asbestos insulation?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 6          At any time, no time period?  I guess
 7          no time period.
 8          A.    I don't know the answer to that
 9   question.
10          Q.    Have you ever testified
11   differently, sir?
12          A.    I don't recall.
13          Q.    Let's take a look at your
14   testimony in the Merrill case again, January
15   18, 2007.  Page 429 you were asked the same
16   question, it was certainly foreseeable to De
17   Laval at the time they sold their pumps and
18   turbines to the United States Navy, it was
19   foreseeable to them that those turbines would
20   be insulated with asbestos insulation and
21   your answer at line 23 was that the turbine
22   could have been insulated, yes; is that
23   correct?
24          A.    Yes and that was after a series
0177
 1   of questions where we talked about who would
 2   actually do the insulation and whether it was
 3   actually to be done or not so it was the end
 4   of a series of questions that's --
 5          Q.    There's no question that I
 6   asked you a series of questions in that
 7   deposition as well, but the bottom line was
 8   when I asked you the one question was it
 9   foreseeable to De Laval at the time they sold
10   their pumps and turbines to the Navy that
11   some of those turbines would be insulated
12   with asbestos, your answer is yes, it was
13   foreseeable, true?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form,
15          but go ahead.
16          A.    In certain applications,
17   certain types of turbines, yes, that's
18   correct, again, subject to the qualifications
19   that occurred in all of the previous
20   questions to that.
21          Q.    Was there any qualification
22   given to your answer in that question?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
24          A.    In that specific question, no,
0178
 1   but you have to look at that question in the
 2   context with the previous X number of pages.
 3          Q.    I don't want there to be any
 4   misleading elements at all.  I want your
 5   testimony to be what your testimony is and as
 6   you sit here today, you would agree with me
 7   that it was foreseeable to De Laval at the
 8   time they sold certain pumps and turbines to
 9   the United States Navy that some of those
10   turbines may be insulated with asbestos
11   insulation, true?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          Go ahead.
14          A.    As you stated it there with
15   those possibilities, yes.
16          Q.    In fact, would you agree with
17   me that at the time that De Laval sold a pump
18   and turbine to the United States Navy or to
19   any customer, they would had to have known
20   the operating temperature of that turbine and
21   that pump?
22          A.    We certainly knew the operating
23   temperature, yes.
24          Q.    It's accurate that De Laval
0179
 1   would know at least at some level the
 2   conditions in which their turbines and pumps
 3   would be used; is that fair?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          A.    That varied widely I think.  It
 6   depends on -- when you say the condition in
 7   which the turbines were to be used, that's a
 8   function of where the customer puts the
 9   turbine, under what -- where he locates it
10   and what he intends to do with it when he
11   gets it in his plant.
12          Q.    De Laval has to know those
13   things or else they cannot make a turbine or
14   a pump that would work for that customer,
15   true?
16          A.    No.
17          Q.    De Laval would know that --
18   first of all, would you agree De Laval was an
19   expert relating to the pumps and turbines
20   that they were selling to customers?
21          A.    Yes.
22          Q.    Would you agree that De Laval
23   would have to know the operating temperature
24   and the operating pressure of the pumps and
0180
 1   turbines that they were selling to customers?
 2          A.    Yes, I didn't say we didn't
 3   know those things.
 4          Q.    So at least as it relates to
 5   temperature and pressure, De Laval would have
 6   to know those types of conditions that their
 7   pump will be used in at the time they sold
 8   the pump and turbine, true?
 9          A.    That's correct.
10          Q.    It's correct, is it not, that
11   De Laval provided insulation drawings to
12   certain ship builders that showed exactly
13   where the insulation should be put on certain
14   De Laval turbines, true?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          A.    Not those related to this case,
17   but on other ships or other classes of ships
18   there were occasions when De Laval was
19   requested by either the Navy or the ship
20   builder or the architect to make such
21   drawings, yes.
22                MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object to
23          the non-responsive portion.
24          Q.    My question was in general and
0181
 1   it's accurate that on occasion De Laval in
 2   fact provided insulation drawings that
 3   indicated exactly what insulation should go
 4   on the turbines that they were selling and
 5   where that insulation should go, true?
 6                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 7          A.    On certain classes of ships,
 8   that's true.
 9          Q.    Some of the De Laval drawings
10   that specifically indicated that there would
11   be insulation on De Laval turbines indicated
12   that some of that insulation would be amosite
13   insulation, true?
14                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
15          A.    Again, the words that appeared
16   depending on who was to furnish the
17   insulation would have been whatever type of
18   material that the person who -- entity that
19   installed it would have used.
20                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
21          non-responsive.
22          Q.    My question was different than
23   that.  My question was some of the insulation
24   drawings that De Laval provided to their
0182
 1   customers for some De Laval turbines
 2   indicated that amosite insulation is what
 3   should be used, true?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 5          A.    You are mischaracterizing my
 6   answer.  First of all, I have seen that word
 7   amosite, the type of asbestos, which is
 8   apparently a type of asbestos used on
 9   drawings on a class of ships, not ships
10   involved in this case, but other classes of
11   ships where De Laval at the request of either
12   the Navy or the ship builder or the architect
13   provided the drawings that showed how the
14   insulation that he the ship builder or the
15   other entity was going to provide should be
16   installed and I think that was done because
17   we knew best the shape of the turbine and
18   compressor or the turbine or pump and this
19   was not done on pumps actually, we knew the
20   shape of the turbine better than the person
21   who was purchasing it did.
22          Q.    De Laval actually provided
23   insulation drawings for fuel oil service
24   pumps that indicated that the insulation of
0183
 1   the turbine should be asbestos containing and
 2   specifically amosite asbestos, true?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 4          and answered.
 5          A.    Would you like to show me the
 6   drawing?
 7          Q.    Do you have an answer to my
 8   question, sir?
 9          A.    I don't know the answer to
10   that.
11                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let's take a
12          look then at the drawing.  I will show
13          you a document that I'm marking as
14          Exhibit 9 to the deposition.
15                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 9,
16          Drawing, marked for Identification.)
17          Q.    You recognize this to be a true
18   and accurate copy of a De Laval Steam Turbine
19   Company drawing for a fuel oil service pump,
20   correct?
21          A.    It appears to be, yes, for a
22   class of cruisers.
23          Q.    But there's no question it's a
24   fuel oil service pump, correct?
0184
 1          A.    No, there's no question of
 2   that.
 3          Q.    It is a fuel oil service pump?
 4          A.    It is a fuel oil service pump.
 5          Q.    This is -- in fact it says
 6   under De Laval Steam Turbine Company it says
 7   fuel oil service pump insulation, true?
 8          A.    That's correct.
 9          Q.    It's hard to read because my
10   copy is small and I apologize for that, but
11   if you turn the page I have blown up certain
12   section that are just parts of that first
13   page, do you see that?
14          A.    This is on the second page?
15                 MR. COLAO: I think it's two
16          pages.  You have the entire document
17          and then you have the blown up
18          version.
19          Q.    You have a blown up version of
20   part of it on the second page.  There you go.
21   This actually has the list of materials, etc.
22   on De Laval's drawing, true?
23          A.    It does.
24          Q.    If we look at the top and it's
0185
 1   still a little hard to read, but the very
 2   first thing listed under list of materials is
 3   asbestos cloth, true?
 4          A.    Yes.
 5          Q.    Underneath that it says --
 6   number two it says insulating material and
 7   then it says asbestos plaster, can you see
 8   that, it's very hard to read under material?
 9          A.    Yeah, it is hard to read, but
10   it could be the words, yes.
11                 MR. COLAO: We're not here to
12          guess.
13          Q.    Isn't that what it says, sir?
14          A.    I don't know.
15          Q.    We'll blow it up for the jury
16   so they could see it.  Under number five it
17   actually says amosite asbestos felt
18   insulation, true?
19          A.    Yes.
20          Q.    Again, this is De Laval's
21   drawing prepared by De Laval, correct?
22          A.    At the behest of the Navy or
23   ship builder or architect.
24          Q.    Under note nine you see it says
0186
 1   this plan to be followed as closely as
 2   possible making such modification as may be
 3   necessary to provide access to bolts, etc.,
 4   true?
 5          A.    Yes, there they are talking
 6   about the dimensions of course.
 7          Q.    If you look on the first page
 8   there is actually the drawing of the turbine
 9   driver of the pump, correct, is that what we
10   are looking at, sir?
11          A.    This whole drawing only
12   involves the turbine driver, yes.
13          Q.    It actually -- there's a couple
14   of things that I highlighted.  On the left
15   there's a section that says asbestos cloth
16   covering and I think it has a little one with
17   a circle around it, do you see that?
18          A.    Yes.
19          Q.    It's actually with an arrow
20   pointing to exactly where the asbestos cloth
21   covering should go, true?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    Then there is another one
24   that's in the middle that says asbestos cloth
0187
 1   covering and again, it indicates exactly
 2   where the asbestos cloth covering should go
 3   on the De Laval turbine, true?
 4          A.    Yes.
 5          Q.    At the bottom there it says
 6   section through insulation of steam inlet and
 7   exhaust, do you see that?
 8          A.    Yes.
 9          Q.    Did I read that correctly, I
10   can't tell?
11          A.    Steam inlet and exhaust, yes.
12          Q.    There's a part that I didn't
13   highlight that's up at the top, there's a
14   little circle next to it that says five and
15   it says removable pad for access to strainer
16   valve stem packing gland and holding nuts and
17   consists of asbestos cloth blankets filled
18   with amosite.  Do you see that?
19          A.    That's more difficult to read,
20   but I see the note, yes.
21          Q.    Five again points to the exact
22   place where the removable pads that have
23   amosite in them are supposed to be located on
24   the De Laval turbine, correct?
0188
 1          A.    Yes.  When you say exact, there
 2   aren't any dimensions here.  It shows the
 3   area that's the cover.  I'm not sure where
 4   you are going with that exact term.
 5          Q.    Fair enough.  This drawing is
 6   De Laval's drawing where they are showing
 7   their customer and in this case it was the
 8   ship builder in the United States Navy where
 9   the insulation should go including asbestos
10   insulation, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
12          and answered.  Go ahead.
13          A.    We are showing the Navy or
14   whoever requested this drawing be made how to
15   apply the insulation to our machine because
16   we knew best the dimensions of our machine
17   and I'm sure the rest of the information on
18   that drawing came from the customer.
19          Q.    There's nothing that's on this
20   drawing that De Laval didn't prepare, true?
21          A.    Didn't prepare?
22          Q.    This is a -- you keep saying
23   something that I don't want to be confusing
24   for the jury.  What we are looking at here
0189
 1   that's been marked as Exhibit 9 is a De Laval
 2   Steam Turbine Company drawing that was
 3   prepared by De Laval Steam Turbine Company,
 4   true?
 5          A.    That's correct.
 6          Q.    There's not any notation on
 7   here that this information was put on here by
 8   a customer.  This information was put on here
 9   by De Laval, true?
10          A.    I didn't say it was put on by
11   the customer.  I said the information had to
12   have come from the customer.
13          Q.    In this drawing it's De Laval
14   that's indicating the type of insulation that
15   should be used including asbestos insulation
16   and where that insulation should go, true?
17                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
18          A.    I would be reasonably certain
19   that it's showing information with respect to
20   the materials to be used that are those that
21   were intended to be used by the shipyard or
22   that the shipyard intended to use and
23   provided that information to De Laval.
24          Q.    Is there any note on here that
0190
 1   says the references to insulation is all
 2   information that De Laval doesn't know
 3   anything about?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          A.    That specific note is not on
 6   here.
 7          Q.    In fact, what we do know is
 8   this drawing and all of its contents was
 9   prepared by De Laval, true?
10          A.    The drawing was prepared by De
11   Laval.
12          Q.    And the material, the list of
13   material and all of the notes that are part
14   of the drawing were prepared by De Laval?
15          A.    They were written on there by
16   De Laval.  Whether they were prepared by De
17   Laval or decided by De Laval, that is the
18   question.
19          Q.    You don't have any evidence
20   that anybody other than De Laval prepared the
21   different parts of this drawing, true?
22          A.    You are mischaracterizing my
23   testimony again.  I did not say that we did
24   not prepare the drawing.  What I'm saying is
0191
 1   that we were asked to prepare the drawing
 2   primarily because we know the shape, the
 3   physical dimensions of the turbine and that
 4   the materials that were intended to be used
 5   were not supplied by us, were not specified
 6   by us and were provided by others and
 7   installed by others.  We are showing them how
 8   to do it if they choose to do it.
 9                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'm going to
10          object to the non-responsive portion.
11          Q.    Sir, to be fair I don't think
12   I've mischaracterized anything.  My question
13   simply was and I would like a simple answer
14   to it it's De Laval that prepared all of the
15   elements of this particular drawing, correct?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
17          Also let me state for the record I do
18          not think his answer was
19          non-responsive, but go ahead.
20          A.    Yes, I think my answer was
21   exactly responsive in the proper context and
22   giving the correct picture.
23          Q.    Do you have an answer to my
24   question, sir?
0192
 1          A.    The answer to your question is
 2   De Laval did not provide this insulation and
 3   did not apply it and therefore would not have
 4   necessarily known what materials were to be
 5   used unless they were told by the person who
 6   intended to use them.
 7          Q.    Sir --
 8          A.    That's the context in which I
 9   believe this drawing was made.
10          Q.    Do you even remember my
11   question, sir?
12          A.    Yes, I think I do.
13          Q.    My question was did De Laval
14   prepare this drawing and everything that's on
15   it?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
17          and answered three times.
18                 MR. GREENSTONE: Never
19          answered.
20                 MR. COLAO: He said that they
21          prepared it.  You just don't like what
22          he adds to that answer.
23                 MR. GREENSTONE: Because it's
24          non-responsive.
0193
 1                 MR. COLAO: So move to strike
 2          it and you have the rest of the
 3          answer.  You don't have to keep asking
 4          the question over and over.
 5                 MR. GREENSTONE: He's not
 6          answering the question.  He's giving
 7          the answer that you told him to give
 8          each time and I'm entitled to an
 9          answer to my question.
10          A.    Frankly I resent that.
11                 MR. COLAO: Hold on.
12          Q.    Do you have an --
13                 MR. COLAO: David, I don't
14          think you need the extra colloquy.
15          Mr. Salzmann is quite capable and I
16          think he shows that throughout his
17          depositions of being able to answer
18          every question that's asked of him and
19          I'll ignore the comment that you made.
20          He is answering that question.  I'll
21          let him answer it one more time.  All
22          I'm saying is he's answering it the
23          best that he can and you have the
24          ability to move to strike the
0194
 1          non-responsive portion which means if
 2          it's non-responsive then what remains
 3          is the responsive portion but you can
 4          ask him it again.
 5          Q.    Sir, do you have any evidence
 6   that anybody else prepared any part of this
 7   drawing other than De Laval, yes or no?
 8          A.    I did not say that anybody
 9   prepared it other than De Laval.  The lines
10   were drawn and the words were written with a
11   pencil that was in the hands of a De Laval
12   employee.
13          Q.    Fair enough.
14          A.    Done at the behest of the
15   customer.
16          Q.    Is there anywhere on this
17   document that it says that De Laval didn't
18   make the decision to put on the words
19   asbestos cloth on here?
20          A.    There are no words on there on
21   that drawing to that affect, but that's what
22   would have had to have happened.
23                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection to
24          the non-responsive portion.
0195
 1          Q.    Is there anywhere on this
 2   drawing where it indicates that anybody told
 3   De Laval to put the words amosite insulation
 4   on this particular drawing?
 5          A.    Again, there are no notes on
 6   the drawing that says this information came
 7   from the Navy, but it did.
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection to
 9          the non-responsive portion.
10          Q.    There is also a drawing that's
11   attached here for a De Laval lubricating oil
12   service pump and turbine, true?
13          A.    Again, for a class of cruisers,
14   the same class of cruisers for which the fuel
15   oil pump drawing was made.
16          Q.    I don't want to belabor the
17   point as it relates to the turbine on the
18   lube oil service pump, but if we look through
19   that drawing also it indicates that De Laval
20   has written in their drawings that asbestos
21   insulation should be used and has indicated
22   exactly where the asbestos insulation should
23   be used, true?
24                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.

 1          A.    Again, I believe De Laval's
 2   input or content value added to this drawing
 3   is the fact that we knew what the turbine
 4   would look like and knew best how to apply
 5   insulation of whatever type and whatever
 6   material the Navy either specified or chose
 7   to purchase.
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
 9          non-responsive.
10          Q.    Again, sir, that was not even
11   close to what I had asked.  My question was
12   isn't it accurate that in this lube oil
13   service pump drawing and we can walk through
14   it if you'd like me to, De Laval indicated on
15   the drawing that asbestos insulation should
16   be used and where that asbestos insulation
17   should be used, true?
18          A.    No.
19          Q.    Let's walk through it then,
20   sir.  Is this a De Laval drawing for a lube
21   oil service pump?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    Didn't De Laval put in their
24   drawing on the list of materials asbestos
0197
 1   cloth?
 2          A.    We put it on the drawing, yes.
 3          Q.    Didn't De Laval put on their
 4   drawing insulating material that's asbestos
 5   plaster?
 6          A.    Yes, we did.
 7          Q.    Didn't De Laval put on their
 8   drawing amosite asbestos felt insulation?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    Didn't De Laval put on their
11   drawing exactly where that asbestos
12   insulation would go on that particular
13   turbine?
14          A.    Yes. That's not to say we said
15   that it should be these particular materials.
16                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
17          non-responsive.
18          A.    That's the responsive part
19   frankly.
20                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection to
21          the side bar and the non-responsive
22          portion.
23          Q.    De Laval knew that if the
24   drawings for their fuel oil service pump
0198
 1   turbine insulation was followed, that
 2   asbestos insulation would be used on the
 3   turbines, true?
 4          A.    If the ship builder chose to
 5   install it, yes.
 6          Q.    De Laval knew that if their
 7   drawing was followed, then asbestos
 8   insulation would be used on the turbines on
 9   their lube oil service pumps, true?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection.
11                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me re-ask
12          it.
13          Q.    De Laval knew that if their
14   drawing was followed, then asbestos
15   insulation would be used on the turbines that
16   drive the De Laval lube oil service pumps,
17   true?
18          A.    Again, if the ship builder
19   chose to install it and purchase the
20   materials he said he was going to use, yes.
21          Q.    Would you agree, sir, that De
22   Laval knew and intended that the turbines on
23   their fuel oil service pumps and lube oil
24   service pumps would be insulated?
0199
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 2          A.    I think the word intended is
 3   not correct.  I think they knew because of
 4   the existence of these drawings for this
 5   class of cruisers that the turbines that
 6   drove the fuel oil service pumps and lube oil
 7   service pumps could be insulated, yes.
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let's take a
 9          look at a tech manual for another fuel
10          oil service pump, fuel oil booster and
11          transfer pump and lube oil service
12          pumps for two different ships other
13          than the ones that are that particular
14          class.  I've marked that document as
15          Exhibit number 10.
16                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 10,
17          Document, marked for Identification.)
18          Q.    Have you seen that document
19   before?
20          A.    I may have.  I'm not sure.
21          Q.    It says -- the top of the
22   page --
23          A.    It applies to two battle ships,
24   yes.
0200
 1          Q.    The top of the page says Fuel
 2   Oil Service Pumps, Fuel Oil Booster &
 3   Transfer Pumps and Lubricating Oil Service
 4   Pumps U.S.S South Dakota BB57 and U.S.S.
 5   Massachusetts BB59 and at the bottom it says
 6   De Laval Steam Turbine Company; is that
 7   correct?
 8          A.    Yes, that's correct.
 9          Q.    If we look at page-- there's a
10   page that I tabbed here.  Sorry, I don't want
11   to get to that page yet.  Two pages before
12   the tabbed page.
13                 MR. COLAO: Which page is this?
14                 MR. GREENSTONE: They don't
15          have page numbers unfortunately.
16                 MR. COLAO: How many pages into
17          it, just count it.
18                 MR. GREENSTONE: Six.  It says
19          at the top Guarantees and then there's
20          a section for Performance Tests and
21          then a section for Drawings Supplied.
22          Q.    Do you see that, sir?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    Then it says drawing supplied
0201
 1   and it says subject fuel oil or FOS class
 2   which I assume means fuel oil service class?
 3          A.    Yes, I would think so.
 4          Q.    Then there is a reference to an
 5   insulation drawing, true?
 6          A.    Yes.
 7          Q.    I want to make sure it's clear
 8   for the record the document that we're
 9   looking at is in fact a De Laval technical
10   manual for a variety of different pumps
11   including fuel oil service pumps, fuel oil
12   booster and transfer pumps and lubricating
13   oil service pumps, true?
14          A.    Aboard two battle ships, yes.
15          Q.    This is a document prepared by
16   De Laval, true?
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    There is an indication here
19   that's there's an insulation drawing that's
20   going to be supplied, correct?
21          A.    That's correct.
22          Q.    If we look on the next page
23   there seems to be something that says LOS
24   class and I'm assuming that means lube oil
0202
 1   service class; is that accurate?
 2          A.    Yes.
 3          Q.    It also has a section where
 4   they indicate that they are supplying an
 5   insulation drawing, true?
 6          A.    Yes.
 7          Q.    If we look at the page that is
 8   tabbed and highlighted, it says steam
 9   admission elements FOS and LOS classes,
10   again, that's talking about fuel oil service
11   and lube oil service classes, true?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    I guess when it says classes,
14   it's talking about that class of pumps; is
15   that accurate?  Where it says FOS and LOS
16   classes, it's talking about fuel oil service
17   and lube oil service classes of pumps?
18          A.    I assume that's what it means
19   on those ships, yes.
20          Q.    If we look down to the part
21   that's highlighted it says to remove the
22   valve elements, it is necessary first to
23   detach the steam chest from the main casing
24   which involves one, breaking the steam inlet
0203
 1   and steam chest drain connections, two,
 2   detaching the line presser gauge and three,
 3   removing the steam chest lagging and
 4   insulation and four, disconnecting the
 5   governor linkage at the valve operating
 6   spindle and then at the bottom it says the
 7   dismantling operations are reversed in
 8   reinstalling the parts; is that accurate?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    Doesn't this indicate to you
11   that as it relates to fuel oil service and
12   lube oil service turbines that drive those
13   types of pumps De Laval certainly knows as
14   indicated in this tech manual that those
15   turbines will be insulated and that the
16   insulation may have to be removed and
17   replaced?
18                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
19          A.    For these two ships, yes.
20          Q.    We're talking about fuel oil
21   service pumps and lube oil service pumps,
22   correct?
23          A.    Aboard two battle ships, yes.
24          Q.    We were also talking about fuel
0204
 1   oil service pumps and lube oil service pumps
 2   in the drawing that we showed, correct?
 3          A.    Aboard cruisers, yes.
 4          Q.    Does this technical manual at
 5   least to the best of your knowledge appear to
 6   be a true and accurate copy of a De Laval
 7   technical manual?
 8          A.    It appears to be, yes.
 9          Q.    That's Exhibit number 10, sir?
10          A.    10.
11          Q.    The document that we marked as
12   Exhibit 9 is a true and accurate copy of De
13   Laval insulation drawings for fuel oil
14   service pumps and lube oil service pumps?
15          A.    On the CL 55 class of cruisers,
16   yes.
17          Q.    De Laval knew that turbines for
18   fuel oil service pumps would be insulated and
19   the insulation that would be used would be
20   asbestos, true?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form
22          and asked and answered.  Go ahead.
23          A.    Again, for those ships that
24   inference is accurate.
0205
 1          Q.    In fact, if you look at the
 2   drawing for the De Laval fuel oil service
 3   pump insulation that's there marked as
 4   Exhibit 9, there is a material list as we
 5   talked about, correct, and some of that is
 6   provided by De Laval and some of it is
 7   provided by the ship builder or somebody
 8   else, true?  Next page is a little easier to
 9   read?
10          A.    Yes, that would be a correct
11   inference from what's on here and the metal
12   parts it appears are those that have a De
13   Laval identification.
14          Q.    There's a little section that
15   says De Laval symbol and I think that you
16   said that before that if there's a De Laval
17   symbol next to it that means that De Laval
18   provided it and if there's not, that means
19   that somebody else provided it, correct?
20          A.    You have to look at a specific
21   bill of material for a specific machine, but
22   if there's a De Laval symbol, then we
23   designed it and most likely provided it at
24   least on some occasions.
0206
 1          Q.    Here the symbol indicates that
 2   or this list of materials indicate that De
 3   Laval would have provided the lagging rod,
 4   the lagging sleeve, actually two different
 5   lagging sleeves and the lagging sleeve cover,
 6   true?
 7          A.    That's what's indicated by this
 8   drawing, yes.
 9          Q.    To make sure it's clear,
10   lagging is a -- it's been referred to as
11   different things in the past, but at least as
12   it's written here lagging refers to metal
13   covering for insulation, fair?
14          A.    It may not necessarily cover
15   insulation, but if there were insulation,
16   then it would cover it.
17          Q.    But that's what lagging is,
18   lagging is covering of insulation?
19          A.    Lagging is sheet metal that's
20   applied over a heavy casing of some sort.  I
21   have seen many instances where lagging only
22   was used.
23          Q.    In this case the lagging would
24   be used to cover the insulation that's
0207
 1   referenced?
 2          A.    That's correct.
 3          Q.    De Laval actually did supply
 4   for fuel oil service pumps and lube oil
 5   service pumps the metal lagging that was
 6   intended to cover the asbestos insulation,
 7   true?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection;
 9          mischaracterizes the testimony.  Go
10          ahead.  My objection is because of the
11          omission of the words turbine driver.
12                 MR. GREENSTONE: That's not
13          intentional.
14                 MR. COLAO: I didn't think it
15          was.
16                 MR. GREENSTONE:  Let me re-ask
17          the question.  Strike the last one.
18          Q.    It's accurate, is it not, that
19   De Laval provided the metal covering that was
20   intended to cover the asbestos insulation on
21   the turbines that drove the De Laval fuel oil
22   service pumps and lube oil service pumps?
23                 MR. COLAO: In that Exhibit.
24                 MR. GREENSTONE: That are
0208
 1          indicated in this Exhibit.
 2          Q.    True?
 3          A.    Yes, that's correct, whatever
 4   the insulation was or whoever applied it the
 5   lagging covers were intended to cover it.
 6          Q.    Certainly De Laval knew that as
 7   it relates to fuel oil service pumps that are
 8   referenced there, they would be insulated,
 9   true?
10                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
11          A.    Again, they could be insulated.
12   Whether the ship builder did or did not is
13   beyond my knowledge.
14          Q.    I just want to make sure that
15   that testimony is clear for the record.  What
16   you're saying is that even though in De
17   Laval's drawing it indicates asbestos
18   insulation and it indicates that De Laval
19   will be providing the lagging cover, it's
20   still your testimony that De Laval would not
21   have known that this would be insulated with
22   asbestos?
23          A.    I didn't say that.  What I said
24   was that we didn't know if it actually was on
0209
 1   a specific pump or a specific ship or at a
 2   specific time on that ship. My experience
 3   tells me that in many instances insulation
 4   once it's removed for maintenance is not
 5   replaced and/or where in situations where a
 6   customer may fully intend to insulate it when
 7   he purchases the equipment he does not
 8   because as I said before it's not an absolute
 9   essential to the operation of the machine.
10                MR. GREENSTONE: Certainly I'll
11          object to the non-responsive
12          portions.
13          Q.    In this instance that we
14   referenced in this drawing, De Laval would
15   certainly have anticipated that their
16   turbines would be insulated with asbestos,
17   correct?
18          A.    Sorry.
19          Q.    Can I re-ask the question?
20          A.    Would you?
21          Q.    Would you agree, sir, that at
22   least as it relates to this drawing that
23   we've talked about, De Laval would have
24   anticipated at the time they sold the turbine
0210
 1   that those turbines would be insulated with
 2   asbestos, true?
 3          A.    We would have known that if the
 4   drawing was followed by the ship builder to
 5   the Navy specification that that's what would
 6   have been done, yes.
 7          Q.    Is there anywhere on the
 8   drawings that we've looked at that states
 9   that the asbestos insulation is optional?
10          A.    No, not on this drawing.
11          Q.    That's Exhibit 9.  Is there
12   anywhere in the tech manual referred to as
13   Exhibit 10 that indicates that the insulation
14   is optional for the turbine?
15          A.    No.
16          Q.    Wouldn't you agree, sir, that
17   it's likely that De Laval turbines for fuel
18   oil service pumps and lube oil service pumps
19   in general are going to get insulated?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
21          A.    No, I wouldn't presume that.
22          Q.    You wouldn't presume that?
23          A.    No.
24          Q.    If it's a pump that's going to
0211
 1   be used in the fire room of a Naval vessel,
 2   wouldn't you presume that it would be
 3   insulated?
 4          A.    I would presume that if it was
 5   aboard the U.S.S South Dakota or
 6   Massachusetts that it was likely or that if
 7   it was on a CL 55 class ship then we would
 8   have presumed it to be possible or even
 9   likely.
10          Q.    If the De Laval fuel oil
11   service pumps and their turbine drivers will
12   be used in the fire room or engine room on a
13   Naval vessel, isn't it likely, sir, that that
14   turbine will be insulated just as those were?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
16          and answered.  Go ahead.
17          A.    I don't know where on the ship
18   these were specifically installed to be
19   honest with you and I would say that the
20   location depending on where it was in
21   whatever room it was installed in and what
22   access people had to it under certain
23   circumstances would be the main determinate
24   of whether it was insulated or not or whether
0212
 1   it was reinsulated once it was installed or
 2   not.
 3          Q.    Certainly De Laval would know
 4   that the turbine drivers of their fuel oil
 5   service pumps could be insulated with
 6   asbestos if they sold them to the United
 7   States Navy, true?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 9          A.    In these cases, yes.
10          Q.    My question is broader than
11   that.  Certainly when De Laval sold a fuel
12   oil service pump and its turbine driver to
13   the United States Navy, De Laval would know
14   that it's possible that that turbine would be
15   insulated with asbestos, true?
16          A.    That it's possible?
17                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
18          A.    Yes, as I said before, anything
19   is possible.
20          Q.    In fact, it's not just one of
21   these anything is possible things, De Laval
22   actually had drawings for certain of their
23   fuel oil service pumps that indicated they --
24   or for certain of their fuel oil service pump
0213
 1   turbines that indicated the turbines would be
 2   insulated, correct?
 3          A.    On certain classes of ships we
 4   showed the user how to insulate them if he
 5   was going to insulation them, yes.
 6          Q.    It's not like this is one of
 7   these questions that's in the realm of
 8   possibility, De Laval certainly knew that it
 9   was a reasonable possibility that the turbine
10   drivers of their fuel oil service pumps and
11   their lube oil service pumps would be
12   insulated with asbestos if sold to the United
13   States Navy, true?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
15          and answered and mischaracterizes his
16          testimony.
17          A.    My answer is again on certain
18   ships that is certainly applicable.  On
19   certain others such as the one that's
20   involved in this case, there's no way to know
21   that.
22          Q.    I want to make sure we remember
23   that testimony because we will get to this
24   ship in just a second.  Did you just testify
0214
 1   under oath that there's no way to know if the
 2   fuel oil service pumps or the turbine drivers
 3   in this case would have been insulated?
 4          A.    I don't know that that's the
 5   case, yes.
 6          Q.    You have not seen anything that
 7   would indicate to you that they would be?
 8          A.    I can't recall that I have.
 9          Q.    We'll get back to that one.
10   Let me ask you this question.  As it relates
11   to fuel oil service pumps in general, what's
12   the difference between the fuel oil service
13   pumps that are referenced on Exhibit 9 and
14   the fuel oil service pumps that are
15   referenced on Exhibit 10 if you know?
16          A.    I don't know.  I don't know
17   specifically what the differences are.  I
18   would suspect they are different horsepowers
19   and so forth, but I don't know.
20          Q.    What's the difference if you
21   know between the lube oil service pumps
22   referenced on Exhibit 9 and Exhibit 10?
23          A.    I don't know specifically.
24          Q.    Would you agree that as a
0215
 1   general principal the fuel oil service pumps
 2   and lube oil service pumps that De Laval sold
 3   to the United States Navy were all similar?
 4          A.    Similar, yes, I would say that.
 5          Q.    They all had turbine drivers,
 6   true?
 7          A.    No.
 8          Q.    Wouldn't you agree that the
 9   fuel oil service pumps and lube oil service
10   pumps that were turbine driven were all
11   similar?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          A.    I think that's generally true.
14          Q.    Let's talk for a second and
15   let's move from the general to the more
16   specific.  Let me ask you this question
17   before I get there.  Would you agree, sir,
18   that De Laval would know at the time they
19   sold fuel oil service pumps and turbines and
20   lube oil service pumps and turbines to the
21   United States Navy they would know that if
22   those turbines were going to be insulated,
23   that that insulation may have to be removed
24   and replaced?
0216
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 2          A.    Yes, as it says in this manual
 3   to get to certain parts it may have to be
 4   removed.
 5          Q.    Let's talk for a few minutes
 6   specifically about Mr. Balthazar's case and
 7   the ships that are at issue in Mr.
 8   Balthazar's case and it's really just one
 9   ship the WILLIS A LEE, correct?
10          A.    I believe so, yes.
11          Q.    We do know that there was De
12   Laval equipment on the WILLIS A LEE, true?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    We in fact know that there
15   would have been De Laval equipment in the
16   fire rooms on the WILLIS A LEE, true?
17          A.    I don't know where the
18   equipment was frankly.
19          Q.    We do know that there would
20   have been De Laval fuel oil service pumps and
21   turbines on the WILLIS A LEE, true?
22          A.    I believe that's among the
23   pieces of equipment that we know of.
24          Q.    Just to make sure that it's
0217
 1   clear, there's no question that those De
 2   Laval fuel oil service pumps that were on the
 3   WILLIS A LEE were sold by your company De
 4   Laval for use in the United States Navy,
 5   true?
 6          A.    As far as I know they were,
 7   yes.
 8          Q.    They were sold to the Navy by
 9   De Laval Steam Turbine Company which is the
10   same company that you are here on behalf of,
11   true?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    There were also De Laval lube
14   oil service pumps on the WILLIS A LEE, true?
15          A.    I'm trying to remember
16   specifically all of the pumps and I don't
17   remember for sure on that one.
18          Q.    Fair enough.
19          A.    I mean depending on the
20   documents I could tell, but I don't recall
21   that.
22          Q.    What documents did you actually
23   review relating to the Balthazar case or the
24   WILLIS A LEE if you know?
0218
 1          A.    These documents were gathered
 2   some time ago, but I did review the order
 3   cards and bills of materials for those
 4   services that we found aboard the WILLIS A
 5   LEE briefly.
 6          Q.    How did you get that material?
 7          A.    From counsel.
 8          Q.    Did you undertake any
 9   independent investigation of what was
10   available?
11          A.    Pardon.
12          Q.    Did you undertake any
13   independent investigation of the documents
14   that were available relating to the De Laval
15   equipment on the WILLIS A LEE?
16          A.    I'm not sure what you mean by
17   independent, but the documents were gathered
18   from the facility where I searched for them.
19          Q.    My point is you're not the one
20   that gathered the documents, counsel for De
21   Laval gathered the documents and gave them to
22   you, true?
23          A.    No.
24          Q.    Tell me how it worked then?
0219
 1          A.    The documents were gathered by
 2   either myself or another person who does that
 3   kind of work and forwarded to counsel.
 4          Q.    I thought that's exactly the
 5   opposite of what you just told us, but that's
 6   okay.  When did you go and gather the
 7   documents and explain to me how it worked?
 8          A.    You asked me where I got the
 9   documents that I reviewed for this
10   deposition.  I got those documents from
11   counsel yesterday and they were the documents
12   that have been produced to you.
13          Q.    My understanding then you were
14   the person that initially found those
15   documents?
16          A.    I can't recall whether it was
17   myself or another person.
18          Q.    Who would the other person have
19   been?
20          A.    Another gentleman that works
21   similar to what I do.
22          Q.    Is he a lawyer?
23          A.    No.
24          Q.    Where are these documents
0220
 1   maintained?
 2          A.    The documents that relate to
 3   turbine division equipment are maintained in
 4   the former De Laval facility in Trenton, New
 5   Jersey.
 6          Q.    Is there some sort of index of
 7   those documents that's available?
 8          A.    I would not say an index.
 9   There are -- maybe I would.  It's an index
10   card that relates to a ship name that gives
11   an indication of what equipment is aboard
12   that ship.
13          Q.    Is this kept in a library
14   somewhere or a file cabinet somewhere?
15          A.    File cabinet.
16          Q.    It's a file cabinet at the De
17   Laval facility?
18          A.    De Laval no longer owns the
19   facility.
20          Q.    Who owns the facility?
21          A.    Siemens Demag De Laval Turbo
22   Machinery.
23          Q.    The documents relating to the
24   De Laval Steam Turbine Company equipment are
0221
 1   located at that facility?
 2          A.    That's correct.
 3          Q.    Whose office are they in or --
 4          A.    They are in a -- well, most of
 5   them are in a small cubby hole.
 6          Q.    Where is that cubby hole
 7   located?
 8          A.    In the office building.
 9          Q.    Where in the office building?
10          A.    Aisle two I think from the end
11   of the building.
12          Q.    Is it in somebody's office or
13   is it in a hallway or is it in a closet or is
14   there a storage facility?
15          A.    It's a cubby hole.
16          Q.    There's a bunch of documents
17   stuffed in there?
18          A.    No.  I said the index cards are
19   in a filing cabinet, 3 by 5 filing cabinet.
20          Q.    They are broken down by ship?
21          A.    By ship name.
22          Q.    For example, what you would do
23   is you would open that up and go to the Ws
24   the WILLIS A LEE or the Ls and pull out the
0222
 1   materials for that particular ship?
 2          A.    I would pull out an index card.
 3          Q.    Right.
 4          A.    To find out if there was an
 5   indication that De Laval sold any equipment
 6   that was to be aboard that ship.
 7          Q.    If there was, where would you
 8   go from there to get the documents?
 9          A.    I need to go to another filing
10   cabinet and look for an order card.
11          Q.    Where is that file cabinet?
12          A.    -- and/r bill of material.
13          Q.    Where is that file cabinet?
14          A.    In the same general area.
15          Q.    It's broken down again by the
16   name of the ship?
17          A.    No.
18          Q.    At that point there's a number
19   I'm guessing?
20          A.    Order number.
21          Q.    Then you go look in the file
22   cabinet for the order number?
23          A.    That's correct.
24          Q.    De Laval generally maintains
0223
 1   purchase orders and bills of materials for
 2   sales to the United States Navy; is that
 3   accurate?
 4          A.    I would call them order cards.
 5   The order cards are as you call it the
 6   engineering memorandum.
 7          Q.    After that I've noticed on a
 8   few of these that there is a bill of material
 9   that's included also and you referenced it a
10   couple of times?
11          A.    That's correct.
12          Q.    That was material that De Laval
13   typically keeps, true?
14          A.    Yes, because that's the
15   governing document that shows what De Laval
16   actually furnished for that order.
17          Q.    That's a pretty important
18   document the bill of material?
19          A.    Yes, as long as the ship has
20   not sunk or it's important as long as the
21   ship is in existence.
22          Q.    It's important for De Laval to
23   keep those?
24          A.    They keep those indefinitely,
0224
 1   yes.
 2          Q.    Has it been your experience
 3   that those are usually available for
 4   particular ships if you find an index card
 5   indicating sales to a particular ship?
 6          A.    Generally, yes.
 7          Q.    In this case you pulled the
 8   documents that related to the WILLIS A LEE;
 9   is that accurate?
10          A.    Again, I can't recall whether I
11   pulled them personally or the other fellow
12   that does this kind of work pulled them.
13                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me show
14          you what I'll mark as the next
15          exhibits to the deposition which are
16          -- I'll mark them separately as
17          Exhibits 11 and 12.  Exhibit 11 is a
18          machinery synopsis reproduced at the
19          national archives for USS 4 and 5
20          talking about a number of different
21          things including the main fuel oil
22          service pump and Exhibit 12 is again a
23          machinery synopsis from the national
24          archives for DL 4 and 5 relating to
0225
 1          some pumps including a fire pump for
 2          the WILLIS A LEE.
 3                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 11,
 4          Machinery Synopsis, marked for
 5          Identification.)
 6                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 12,
 7          Machinery Synopsis, marked for
 8          Identification.)
 9          Q.    Have you seen these documents
10   before, sir?
11          A.    No.
12          Q.    Do you know that DL 4 is in
13   fact the WILLIS A LEE?
14          A.    I believe that's the correct
15   number, yes.
16          Q.    You see on that machinery
17   synopsis it indicates that two De Laval fuel
18   oil service pumps and turbines that drove
19   them would be in each fire room on those
20   ships?
21          A.    You have to point out to me
22   where you are getting the information.
23          Q.    The part that's highlighted?
24          A.    You have a main fuel oil
0226
 1   service pump and a port fuel oil service
 2   pump.
 3          Q.    I'll show you, sir, if you hand
 4   me the document back.  At the top you see it
 5   says main fuel oil service pump and then it
 6   says two in each fire room and it says De
 7   Laval and then De Laval turbine, do you see
 8   where it says that?
 9          A.    Yes.
10          Q.    Is that consistent with what
11   you found in this case namely that there
12   would have been four De Laval fuel oil
13   service pumps and four De Laval turbines that
14   were on the WILLIS A LEE?
15          A.    I believe that number is
16   correct, yes.
17          Q.    If you break that down, two of
18   them go in each fire room so two of them
19   would have been in the fore fire room and two
20   of them would have been in the aft fire room?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
22          A.    Probably port and starboard,
23   but that's close enough.
24          Q.    Then if we look, it also
0227
 1   appears that there would have been a De Laval
 2   port fuel oil service pump that was motor
 3   driven, one in each fire room; is that
 4   accurate?
 5          A.    Yes, that appears to be
 6   correct.
 7          Q.    If you look at the -- so so far
 8   we're up to basically three De Laval pumps in
 9   each fire room on the WILLIS A LEE, correct?
10          A.    That's what's suggested by
11   this, yes.
12          Q.    On the next document that's
13   Exhibit 12 it indicates a fire pump that was
14   made by Worthington; is that accurate?
15          A.    Yes, appears to be.
16          Q.    It says one in each fire room;
17   is that correct?
18          A.    Yes, it does.
19          Q.    Who does it indicate made the
20   turbine that drove the Worthington fire pump?
21          A.    It indicates De Laval.
22          Q.    Let me ask you these questions,
23   sir.  Did you find the documents that relate
24   to all of these different pieces of equipment
0228
 1   on the WILLIS A LEE?
 2          A.    We did not find anything
 3   related to the fire pumps for Worthington.
 4          Q.    Did you look for any?
 5          A.    We looked for everything that
 6   was aboard the WILLIS A LEE.
 7          Q.    That doesn't mean that you
 8   didn't actually have the De Laval turbine
 9   that was driving the Worthington pump, it
10   just means that you don't have the records
11   for it, true?
12          A.    Yes, we didn't find any records
13   for it.
14          Q.    My point is this is in the
15   synopsis that the Navy prepares relating to
16   the equipment that's on the WILLIS A LEE.
17   You're not saying that De Laval did not
18   supply the turbine for the Worthington fire
19   pump, you're just saying you did not find any
20   records?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
22          A.    That's correct.
23          Q.    Do you know how long De Laval
24   keeps records?
0229
 1          A.    Depends on the records, but
 2   order cards and bills of material at least
 3   while De Laval owned the facility were kept
 4   indefinitely.
 5          Q.    Did you find indication or did
 6   your records confirm that De Laval had sold
 7   four fuel oil service -- main fuel oil
 8   service pumps for use on the WILLIS A LEE?
 9          A.    I believe so.
10          Q.    And two port fuel oil service
11   pumps for use on the WILLIS A LEE?
12          A.    I'm not sure about that.
13          Q.    Did you find those records?
14          A.    Those records they were not
15   turbine driven pumps so they would be in
16   North Carolina.
17          Q.    You didn't look in North
18   Carolina?
19          A.    No.
20          Q.    Fair enough.  As it relates to
21   the turbine that drove the Worthington fire
22   pump that's referenced in Exhibit 12, would
23   those documents have been kept somewhere else
24   because you were just selling the turbine and
0230
 1   not the whole pump?
 2          A.    No, if we provided those
 3   turbines they would have most likely been in
 4   Trenton.
 5          Q.    You didn't find them?
 6          A.    No.
 7          Q.    If the Navy synopsis is correct
 8   that was at the national archives, would it
 9   be accurate that there were in fact three De
10   Laval turbines in each fire room of the
11   WILLIS A LEE?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          A.    Yes, if that's correct, there
14   were.
15          Q.    You're not saying that that's
16   not correct, true?
17          A.    No.
18          Q.    No, you're not saying that
19   that's not correct?
20          A.    I think you better ask the
21   question the way you want it.
22          Q.    Fair enough.  You are not -- as
23   the representative of IMO, you are not
24   testifying that there were not three De Laval
0231
 1   turbines in each fire room on the WILLIS A
 2   LEE, true?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 4          Q.    As far as you know, there were
 5   in fact three De Laval turbines?
 6          A.    According to that document
 7   there were three turbines.
 8          Q.    You are not disputing that
 9   there were in fact three De Laval turbines in
10   each fire room on the WILLIS A LEE, true?
11          A.    You foul it up with that word
12   true at the end of each one.
13          Q.    All you have to do is say yes,
14   it's true?
15          A.    Before you got to there, the
16   answer was no, I'm not denying that there
17   were -- that the Navy archives say that there
18   were three turbines aboard the WILLIS A LEE
19   in each fire room.
20          Q.    I think we are there.  I have
21   to re-ask the question.  If the Navy
22   documents are correct, then there were three
23   De Laval turbines in each fire room on the
24   WILLIS A LEE?
0232
 1          A.    Yes.
 2          Q.    You are not disputing that?
 3          A.    I didn't, did I, I said yes.
 4                 MR. COLAO: Do you want to take
 5          a break?
 6                 MR. GREENSTONE: No, I'm okay.
 7          You guys need a break?
 8                 THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would
 9          like to take one.
10                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
11          3:13.  This ends tape three of the
12          videotaped deposition of Richard M.
13          Salzmann.  We are off the record.
14                 (Recess taken.)
15                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
16          3:27.  This begins tape four of the
17          videotaped deposition of Richard M.
18          Salzmann.  We are on the record.
19          Q.    Mr. Salzmann, are you ready to
20   continue?
21          A.    Yes.
22          Q.    We were talking about the De
23   Laval pumps and turbines that were in the
24   fire rooms on the WILLIS A LEE, do you
0233
 1   remember that line of questions?
 2          A.    Yes.
 3          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
 4   that De Laval shipped the pump and the
 5   turbine together to the ship builder or to
 6   the Navy for use on the WILLIS A LEE?
 7                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: Why?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Not every pump had
10          a turbine.
11                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me clarify
12          that.
13          Q.    With respect to the De Laval
14   fuel oil service pumps that were turbine
15   driven that we've referenced in the synopsis
16   here, is it accurate that De Laval would have
17   shipped the pump and the turbine together as
18   one unit?
19          A.    I don't know, but that would be
20   the normal thing I believe.
21          Q.    Normally the turbine came with
22   the pump?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    Is it accurate that the
0234
 1   turbines that were driving these fuel oil
 2   service pumps in the fire rooms on the WILLIS
 3   A LEE would have contained asbestos packing?
 4          A.    That is quite possible, yes.
 5          Q.    In fact isn't it likely?
 6          A.    It's likely.
 7          Q.    They would have been shipped
 8   with the asbestos packing as an internal
 9   component, true?
10          A.    That would be the norm, yes.
11          Q.    Sir, can you tell us any
12   differences between the De Laval fuel oil
13   service pumps and turbines that were in the
14   fire rooms on the WILLIS A LEE and those that
15   are referenced in the drawings in Exhibit 9
16   or the tech manual in Exhibit 10?
17          A.    I can't tell you the specific
18   differences without looking at the documents,
19   but they were similar, but I would say they
20   were not identical.
21          Q.    Can you site for me as you sit
22   here today on behalf of IMO any differences
23   between the fuel oil service pumps and
24   turbines on the WILLIS A LEE and those
0235
 1   referenced in Exhibits 9 and 10?
 2          A.    No, I said I would have to look
 3   at them in detail to try and figure out what
 4   the differences are.
 5          Q.    You have not tried to do that?
 6          A.    No.
 7          Q.    As you sit here today, you are
 8   not aware of any major differences between
 9   them?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
11          A.    I'm not aware of what the
12   differences would be whether they would be
13   major or minor or what.
14          Q.    You haven't looked to see if
15   there were any differences at all, true?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
17          and answered.
18          A.    No, these ships are not at
19   issue in this case so I haven't looked at any
20   details of them.
21          Q.    As you sit here today, you
22   cannot testify that there were any
23   differences between the De Laval fuel oil
24   service pumps and turbines on the WILLIS A
0236
 1   LEE and those referenced in 9 and 10, true?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection;
 3          mischaracterizes his testimony.
 4          A.    I would say there likely are
 5   differences, I just don't know what they are.
 6          Q.    You know that they are similar
 7   pumps and turbines, correct?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
 9          and answered.
10          A.    They are most likely similar,
11   yes.
12          Q.    Would the turbines have been
13   roughly the same size on the WILLIS A LEE as
14   those that are being referenced in Exhibits 9
15   and 10 or do you know?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
17          A.    I don't know.  There were
18   different horse powers for these services on
19   different ships.
20          Q.    Do you know what the horse
21   powers were for the turbines that were on the
22   WILLIS A LEE verses those that were
23   referenced in Exhibits 9 and 10?
24          A.    Not verses those in 9 and 10.
0237
 1   I could tell you from those documents what
 2   the horse powers were for those turbines
 3   aboard the WILLIS A LEE.
 4          Q.    Do you know if the turbines on
 5   the fuel oil service pumps on the WILLIS A
 6   LEE would have been similar in appearance to
 7   the turbines that were referenced in Exhibits
 8   9 and 10 or do you know?
 9          A.    I'm not sure.
10          Q.    Are there turbines that are
11   vastly different in appearance?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    That drive fuel oil service
14   pumps for use in Navy fire rooms?
15          A.    I'm trying to recall whether
16   all of them are even oriented the same way.
17   I'm not sure that they are.  For example,
18   some are vertical units.  I know a lot of
19   them are vertical units, but I believe there
20   are also some horizontal units which would
21   look completely different.
22          Q.    Why don't you take some time to
23   look at Exhibits 9 and 10 and see if you
24   could point out any differences between those
0238
 1   fuel oil service pumps and turbines and the
 2   ones on the WILLIS A LEE?
 3          A.    I don't know that I can tell
 4   that by looking at these documents because I
 5   don't have comparable documents for the
 6   WILLIS A LEE.  I have the detailed
 7   information on the WILLIS A LEE that tells
 8   you the performance characteristics of the
 9   turbine and the bill of materials tell you
10   the details of what's in them.
11                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let's go off
12          the record for just a second.  This is
13          why we will need his depo in every
14          case.
15                 MR. COLAO: Let's go off.
16                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
17          3:33.  We're going off the record.
18                 (Recess taken.)
19                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is
20          3:34.  We are on the record.
21          Q.    Sir, would you agree with me
22   that all of the De Laval fuel oil service
23   pumps that were turbine driven that were sold
24   to the United States Navy for use in fire
0239
 1   rooms on Navy ships were similar in nature?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 3          A.    That's far too broad a
 4   statement.  I don't know the answer to that.
 5          Q.    All of the De Laval fuel oil
 6   service pumps and turbines that were sold to
 7   the United States Navy for use in fire rooms
 8   on Naval vessels were designed to do
 9   basically the same things, true?
10                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
11          A.    The functions would be similar,
12   yes.
13          Q.    The various parts of the
14   turbine would be similar too, fair?
15          A.    There would be, yes, there
16   would be similar parts in terms of the
17   function of the part. There would be blades
18   on all the turbines or they all have casings
19   so yes, in that sense they have similar
20   parts.
21          Q.    Are there different model
22   numbers for different De Laval fuel oil
23   service pumps?
24          A.    Yes.
0240
 1          Q.    What are the model numbers that
 2   are relating to the De Laval fuel oil service
 3   pumps referenced in 9 and 10?
 4          A.    I don't know.
 5          Q.    Do you know what the model
 6   number is for those that are related to the
 7   WILLIS A LEE?
 8          A.    Yes, from those documents if
 9   you show me those documents.
10          Q.    I'll do that in just a second.
11   Before we get there, I want to lay a little
12   bit more background.  What do the different
13   models represents if you know?
14          A.    Different power, different
15   styles of casings possibly, different
16   orientation of inlet and exhaust nozzles.
17          Q.    How many different models of De
18   Laval fuel oil service pumps are there?
19          A.    I don't know.
20          Q.    Do you know if there's more
21   than two?
22          A.    I suspect there are many more
23   than two.
24          Q.    Do you know if there's more
0241
 1   than 10?
 2          A.    There may very well be.
 3          Q.    Do you actually know or you are
 4   just guessing?
 5          A.    No, I'm sure there are many.
 6   These turbines were not standard items that
 7   were produced for stock and then somebody
 8   sold them off a shelf.  They were produced
 9   specifically for a function in terms of
10   horsepower, speed, the functions that a
11   turbine must do, power, and they were
12   specific to a given type of ship.
13          Q.    Are there some De Laval
14   turbines that were used as drivers for fuel
15   oil services pumps that run cold?
16          A.    No.
17          Q.    They all run hot?
18          A.    To varying degrees, yes.
19          Q.    Do you know what the
20   temperature ranges would be for how hot the
21   turbines run as an average?
22          A.    I could look, again, I could
23   look at the documents and tell you what the
24   temperatures were for that particular group
0242
 1   of turbines.
 2          Q.    I do want to get to that, but
 3   my question is more general than that.  Is
 4   there a range of temperatures that the De
 5   Laval turbines that drove fuel oil service
 6   pumps would work?
 7          A.    If they all used steam from the
 8   same pressure level, then those would be
 9   consistent.  If different -- if on different
10   ships the steam came from a different point
11   in the production or use of that steam.  For
12   example, if it came directly from the boiler,
13   it would be higher in pressure and therefore
14   temperature than if it came from the cross
15   over between the low and high pressure
16   turbine.
17          Q.    Fair enough.
18          A.    So there is a range and it's
19   probably relatively consistent for a given
20   type of ship.
21          Q.    Are you aware of any turbines
22   that drove any type of De Laval pumps that
23   were not hot?
24          A.    Again, hot is a generality.
0243
 1   They were all above 212 degrees obviously
 2   because it takes that temperature to produce
 3   steam.
 4          Q.    So all turbines that drove De
 5   Laval pumps to the extent that there were
 6   turbines driving the pump, it's going to at
 7   least be above 212 degrees?
 8          A.    That's correct.
 9          Q.    That's too hot to touch without
10   getting burned; is that fair?
11          A.    If that temperature were
12   transferred through to the surface of a case,
13   yes.
14          Q.    That would apply whether the
15   turbine was on the fuel oil service pump in
16   the WILLIS A LEE or on the U.S.S Springfield
17   or those battle ships that are referenced in
18   9 or 10, true?
19          A.    That's generally true, yes.
20          Q.    Certainly at a temperature
21   above 212 degrees, it would be reasonable to
22   think that the turbines that drive pumps are
23   going to be insulated on Navy ships?
24          A.    Depends on where they are.
0244
 1          Q.    If they are in an area where
 2   somebody could touch them, they would need to
 3   be insulated, true?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          A.    That's a function of the Navy's
 6   decision as to where and when they insulate,
 7   but they certainly could be.
 8          Q.    I think that I understood your
 9   answer and correct me if I'm wrong, but what
10   I believe you are trying to say is if the
11   turbine was in a place in which nobody could
12   possibly get to it, then it would not
13   necessarily need to be insulated, but if it
14   was in a place where people would be around,
15   then it would be insulated most likely?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
17          A.    Then the Navy would be more
18   likely to do that, yes, I would say that.
19          Q.    That's accurate whether we are
20   talking about the WILLIS A LEE or the
21   carriers in Exhibit 9 or the battle ships in
22   10 or any De Laval fuel oil service pumps
23   that are turbine driven, true?
24                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
0245
 1          A.    I would say that's generally
 2   true, yes.
 3          Q.    As it relates to turbines that
 4   drive all De Laval pumps regardless of the
 5   type of pump, if it's turbine driven and it's
 6   going to be placed in a place where people
 7   could be around it, most likely it will be
 8   insulated, true?
 9          A.    Again, it's a function of what
10   the Navy sees as access and where it's
11   located and who's working on it and when, but
12   it's possible, yes.
13          Q.    Certainly if people are going
14   to be working in close proximity to any De
15   Laval turbine regardless of the ship, most
16   likely that turbine will be insulated, true?
17          A.    You're working your way towards
18   absolutes and again, I don't know.
19          Q.    I don't think I was trying to
20   get an absolute, I think I asked you what was
21   most likely.
22          A.    I'm saying it's possible.
23          Q.    My question was based on
24   nothing else other than the temperature
0246
 1   range, 212 degrees of these turbines that you
 2   said was at the minimum what they had to be,
 3   if a De Laval turbine regardless of the ship
 4   or regardless of the location was in an area
 5   where people had direct access and contact
 6   with it, then it would most likely be
 7   insulated; is that fair?
 8          A.    While it was operating then
 9   that's a possibility, yes.
10          Q.    It most likely would be
11   insulated while it was operating, true?
12                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
13          A.    What I was getting at if it was
14   in an area where people had to work around it
15   while it was operating as opposed to being
16   shut down for maintenance, for example, then
17   the Navy could have made a decision to
18   insulate it, yes.
19          Q.    That would certainly be
20   something that was foreseeable to De Laval at
21   the time that they sold turbines to any
22   customer, true?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
24          A.    That's not so universal, no, I
0247
 1   wouldn't say that as a universal truism.
 2          Q.    Can we at least agree on this,
 3   that De Laval would know at the time that
 4   they sold a turbine, any kind of turbine to
 5   any customer, that they would know that the
 6   operating temperature would have to be at
 7   least 212 degrees?
 8          A.    That's true.
 9          Q.    De Laval would have known that
10   that operating temperature is hot enough to
11   burn seriously a human being if they come
12   into contact with it?
13          A.    If they touch it, yes.  If that
14   temperature is on the skin of the turbine,
15   yes.
16          Q.    Certainly it wouldn't be any
17   surprise to De Laval at the time they sold
18   the turbine, any turbine, that that turbine
19   would get insulated?
20                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
21          and answered.
22          A.    It would not be a surprise one
23   way or the other.
24                MR. GREENSTONE: Let's take a
0248
 1          look at what I'll mark as Exhibits 13
 2          and 14.
 3                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 13,
 4          Documents, marked for Identification.)
 5                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 14,
 6          Document, Bates labeled IMO 00120
 7          through 00140, marked for
 8          Identification.)
 9          Q.    Exhibit 13 is a document under
10   a cover letter and the cover letter is March
11   26, 2007 from John Felice that enclosed are
12   the following De Laval records relating to
13   the WILLIS A LEE and it has a bunch of my
14   tabs on it that we will take off before we
15   attach the Exhibit and I would like to get a
16   copy of it back, doesn't have to be my copy,
17   but could you flip through that very quickly
18   and tell me if you have seen that set of
19   documents before?
20          A.    Yes.  This appears to be the
21   set that I reviewed very briefly before the
22   deposition.
23          Q.    There is another set that I was
24   given -- first of all, those documents that
0249
 1   are there are true and accurate copies of De
 2   Laval documents from De Laval's files; is
 3   that fair, other than the cover letter which
 4   was a letter from an attorney?
 5          A.    Yes, that certainly appears to
 6   be the case.
 7          Q.    I'm going to mark as Exhibit 14
 8   and show you another document that has a
 9   bunch of tabs on it so we have to go back and
10   forth which is a subsequent set of documents
11   that I received from counsel for De Laval
12   just a few days ago and I want to ask you if
13   you have seen that set of documents as well?
14          A.    Yes, I believe so.
15          Q.    When did you see those
16   documents for the first time?
17          A.    Well, I can't recall, again, as
18   I said who exactly gathered these.  I may
19   have seen these at some previous time.  I
20   looked at them briefly yesterday.
21          Q.    Do you have any idea and if you
22   don't know then I completely accept that, but
23   do you have any idea why there were the two
24   separate productions of documents, one that
0250
 1   related to the main reduction gear and lube
 2   oil service pumps and the second one which
 3   relates to the fuel oil service pumps and the
 4   main condensate pumps?
 5          A.    No.
 6          Q.    Did you separate them like
 7   that?
 8          A.    No, I don't believe so.
 9          Q.    Did you pull all of the
10   documents together that would have included
11   all four of those different pieces of
12   equipment that we talked about; the reduction
13   gear, the lube oil pumps, the fuel oil
14   service pumps and the main condensate pumps?
15          A.    Again, I can't recall whether
16   it was me or the other fellow who does this,
17   but whoever did most likely pulled them all
18   together, but I'm not positive of that.
19          Q.    You don't have any idea why we
20   were first just provided the documents
21   relating to the main reduction gear and the
22   lube oil service pumps and then later
23   provided documents for the fuel oil service
24   pumps?
0251
 1          A.    No, I don't.
 2          Q.    In any event, all of those
 3   different pieces of equipment were on the
 4   WILLIS A LEE, true?
 5          A.    That appears to be the case,
 6   yes.
 7          Q.    Can I have Exhibit 14 is the
 8   one I'm looking for.  This is the one and is
 9   it accurate that -- first of all, Exhibit 14
10   is also a true and accurate copy of documents
11   in De Laval's files, correct?
12          A.    That appears to be the case,
13   yes.
14          Q.    Are all of these documents that
15   make up Exhibit 13 and 14 kept as business
16   records of De Laval?
17          A.    First of all, De Laval doesn't
18   own these records any longer.  Seamans Demag
19   De Laval does and I don't know whether they
20   would be -- I'm not sure of the definition of
21   business records, but most of these ships are
22   long since sunk or scrapped or decommissioned
23   and so forth so in that sense I wouldn't
24   really consider them business records because
0252
 1   they will not do any business from them, but
 2   they are retained unless somebody decides to
 3   discard them for that reason because they
 4   don't -- the equipment doesn't exist anymore.
 5                 MR. GREENSTONE: Counselor, are
 6          you going to dispute that these are
 7          business records of De Laval, Exhibits
 8          13 and 14?
 9                 MR. COLAO: No.
10                 MR. GREENSTONE: Thank you.
11                 MR. COLAO: That's a legal term
12          of art.
13                 THE WITNESS:  That's what I
14          figured.
15                 MR. GREENSTONE: It just
16          shortens the depo.
17          Q.    Is it accurate that Exhibit 14
18   are the documents that you have seen that
19   relate to the fuel oil service pumps that
20   were in the fire rooms of the WILLIS A LEE?
21          A.    These documents don't say
22   anything about where they were, but your
23   other record did, but they certainly are the
24   documents for the main fuel oil service
0253
 1   pumps, yes.
 2          Q.    It indicates there and it's a
 3   little hard to read, but it indicates that in
 4   fact De Laval is providing 16 pumps as a part
 5   of this purchase order, correct?
 6          A.    Yes, that's correct.
 7          Q.    If I'm correct with my math,
 8   there's four ships, four pumps per ship, two
 9   pumps per fire room on each ship?
10          A.    I believe that's correct.
11          Q.    Adds up to 16 total?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    So that, again, the fact that
14   they are selling 16 for the 920 -- and in
15   fact it does reference on that front page
16   that this is for the 927 class of ships?
17          A.    That's correct.
18          Q.    Of those there are four ships
19   in that class at least as far as you know?
20          A.    As far as I know, yes.
21          Q.    So, again, saying there were 16
22   sold is completely consistent with what we
23   talked about and what's in the synopsis,
24   namely that there would have been two De
0254
 1   Laval fuel oil service pumps in each fire
 2   room on each of those ships?
 3          A.    That's correct.
 4          Q.    There's usually two fire rooms
 5   per ship?
 6          A.    Yes.
 7          Q.    If you look and I apologize for
 8   having to pass it back and forth, can I see
 9   that document one more time, did you notice
10   in this document that it indicates that in
11   fact De Laval will be providing spare packing
12   for the turbine and I'm looking now at page
13   -- it has an IMO Bates number at the bottom,
14   IMO 00126?
15          A.    Yes, it does say two sets of
16   gland packing, but that's not the packing
17   that you are thinking of.
18                MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object to
19          the non-responsive portion.
20          Q.    Is IMO providing the
21   replacement packing as indicated in that
22   document?
23          A.    Yes, that's carbon ring
24   packing.
0255
 1          Q.    Do you think that De Laval did
 2   not provide the asbestos packing for the
 3   turbine?
 4          A.    I didn't say that.
 5          Q.    You just don't see any
 6   indication that they provided spare asbestos
 7   packing?
 8          A.    That's correct.
 9          Q.    Can you turn to the bill of
10   materials and settle the issue once and for
11   all?  Again, I'm asking for you to turn to
12   the bill of materials relating to the De
13   Laval fuel oil service pumps?
14          A.    Is this the one we didn't find?
15   I think it is.  I'm sorry, we did not find
16   the bill of material for the fuel oil service
17   pumps.
18          Q.    You didn't find it?
19          A.    That's correct.
20          Q.    Didn't you testify that that
21   was an important document that is almost
22   always kept?
23          A.    Yes.
24          Q.    You didn't find it in this
0256
 1   case?
 2          A.    In this particular case, rare,
 3   but in this particular case we did not.
 4          Q.    Go ahead and look at Exhibit 13
 5   because I was provided two sets of documents,
 6   one that's Exhibit 13 and one that's Exhibit
 7   14.  Maybe it's in Exhibit 13?
 8          A.    Which Exhibit am I looking at?
 9          Q.    You are looking at 14.
10          A.    The bill of material for the
11   condensate pumps are here.
12          Q.    That's not the one I'm
13   interested in.  I'm interested in the one
14   that would tell me what asbestos products if
15   any De Laval would have sold as part of the
16   fuel oil service pumps and the bill of
17   materials is not there and I wanted to see if
18   you would take a look through Exhibit 13 and
19   see if maybe it got attached to that set by
20   mistake?
21          A.    No, I don't think it did.  I
22   think I recall that we could not find it on
23   these particular fuel oil service pumps.
24          Q.    I just want to make sure it's
0257
 1   clear for the record --
 2          A.    No, this bill of material
 3   that's attached to -- as a matter of fact,
 4   the entire Exhibit 13 all applies to the main
 5   reduction gears.
 6          Q.    I actually think there's a part
 7   of that document that relates to lube oil
 8   services pumps as well, will you take a look
 9   and see, I might have even tabbed it for you.
10   It's probably about halfway back.
11          A.    What that is is an attached,
12   yes, it's a lube oil pump drive.  It's a lube
13   oil pump that's driven off the main reduction
14   gear, okay.
15          Q.    Do you know whether or not that
16   particular piece of equipment will be located
17   in the aft fire room on the WILLIS A LEE or
18   not?
19          A.    I don't think the gears are
20   located in the fire room, no.
21          Q.    They are generally located in
22   the engine space or the engine room?
23          A.    I would say that's more likely,
24   but I don't know specifically.
0258
 1          Q.    Were you aware that in this
 2   case that the part of the ship that's really
 3   most relevant is the part where my client
 4   worked while he was on the WILLIS A LEE which
 5   would have been the aft fire room, were you
 6   aware of that?
 7          A.    No.
 8          Q.    The first production of
 9   documents that I got that's Exhibit 13 that
10   relates to the main reduction gear and the
11   attached lube oil service pumps, that really
12   doesn't relate at all to what would have been
13   in the aft fire room, true?
14          A.    Again, I'm not certain, but
15   probably not.
16          Q.    Just for the sake of clarity,
17   there's a bill of material attached to the
18   main reduction gear documents and to the lube
19   oil service pump documents, true?
20          A.    Yes, there's a bill of material
21   for the main reduction gear that includes the
22   lube oil service pumps, yes.
23          Q.    On the second document that I
24   got which is Exhibit 14 it involves two
0259
 1   different types of pumps, the fuel oil
 2   service pumps and the main condensate pumps,
 3   true?
 4          A.    That's correct.
 5          Q.    Again, the main condensate
 6   pumps, would they be located in the fire
 7   rooms?
 8          A.    Again, I don't know where they
 9   are located.
10          Q.    If we know that the De Laval
11   pumps that were and turbines that were in
12   fact in the aft fire room on my client's ship
13   the ones that are most relevant are the fuel
14   oil service pumps and turbines that we've
15   already talked about, then that's only one of
16   the set of documents that we got in that
17   Exhibit 14, correct?
18                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
19          A.    That's correct.
20          Q.    The only bill of material
21   that's missing of all of the stuff that you
22   guys provided me is the bill of material that
23   relates to the fuel oil service pumps and
24   turbines that actually would have been where
0260
 1   my client worked, true?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 3          A.    If that's where your client
 4   worked, that's correct, yes.
 5          Q.    So you were able to find and
 6   give me the bill of materials for all of the
 7   products that don't really relate to this
 8   case, but the ones that do relate to this
 9   case that's the one you couldn't find?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
11          argumentative and certainly Mr.
12          Salzmann testified that he did not
13          have any idea where Mr. Balthazar
14          worked or didn't work.
15          A.    I was asked to look for all
16   documents related to equipment aboard the
17   LEE.  I did that.
18                MR. GREENSTONE: I'll object to
19          the non-responsive portion.
20          Q.    My question is a little bit
21   different and it's a very simple question and
22   it simply is that you were able to find and
23   provide to me bills of materials for all of
24   the pieces of equipment except the pieces of
0261
 1   equipment that were in my client's work
 2   space?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 4          That's not true.
 5          A.    If you are trying to imply that
 6   I deliberately did not find some documents
 7   that are applicable, you are absolutely
 8   incorrect and I resent the implication.
 9                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
10          non-responsive.
11          A.    The response is very
12   responsive.
13          Q.    Is it accurate, sir --
14          A.    It's not accurate, your
15   question is not accurate and it's implying
16   something that's absolutely incorrect.
17          Q.    Fair enough.  Show me the bill
18   of material for the fuel oil service pumps?
19          A.    It could not be found.  I
20   already told you by the way in previous
21   answers that it was very likely that the
22   packing at the valve stems contained
23   asbestos.  We already talked about what was
24   likely the asbestos components on those very
0262
 1   turbines so I'm not disputing what was on
 2   there.  I already told you what I thought was
 3   on there.
 4                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
 5          non-responsive.
 6          A.    It's very responsive.
 7                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
 8          non-responsive.
 9          Q.    Sir, did we not talk a few
10   minutes ago about how common it was in the
11   regular course of business for De Laval to
12   keep and hold on to the bills of materials?
13          A.    Yes, we talked about that and
14   in 99 percent of the cases I find them.
15          Q.    Fair enough.
16          A.    I'm very good at this.
17          Q.    Fair enough, sir, and this case
18   the bill of material that relates to the
19   products that my client actually worked with
20   in the aft fire room of the WILLIS A LEE --
21          A.    Which I was not aware of.
22                 MR. GREENSTONE: Objection;
23          non-responsive.
24                 MR. COLAO: If you ask a fair
0263
 1          question, maybe you would not get that
 2          kind of answer because now you are
 3          beginning to manipulate the witness
 4          and I object.
 5                 MR. GREENSTONE: Listen, Joe,
 6          you weren't the one that provided
 7          these documents to me and I accuse you
 8          of nothing and I accuse the witness of
 9          nothing.
10                 MR. COLAO: The question
11          implies an accusation.  You've already
12          --
13                 MR. GREENSTONE: Look at the
14          way my production took place.
15                 MR. COLAO: The question
16          implies an accusation.  That's all I'm
17          responding to.
18                 MR. GREENSTONE: The witness
19          didn't provide me documents and
20          neither did you.  Counsel did and the
21          first set of documents they provided
22          did not even have fuel oil service
23          pumps documents, I had to ask for them
24          separately and when I got them, they
0264
 1          were missing the bill of material.
 2                 MR. COLAO: Did you ever ask
 3          counsel why that was the case?
 4                 MR. GREENSTONE: I actually did
 5          ask them why that was the case and
 6          they had no answer.
 7                 MR. COLAO: I'll be glad to
 8          tell you why it is off the record and
 9          it's an issue having to do just with
10          the lawyers in the case and not
11          anything that Mr. Salzmann did or
12          didn't do.
13                 MR. GREENSTONE: Not accusing
14          him of one thing.  He's not the one
15          that provided me documents, the
16          lawyers did.
17                 MR. COLAO: It comes across
18          that way so take their deposition.
19                 MR. GREENSTONE: I wish I
20          could.
21                 MR. COLAO: That's how it comes
22          across.  You have taken Mr. Salzmann's
23          depositions before.  I think he's a
24          very responsive witness and he's not
0265
 1          someone who gets upset and I think
 2          he's correct to get upset the way he
 3          did given the nature of the question
 4          because it sounds accusatory and I'm
 5          representing to you on the record in
 6          front of this jury that there is
 7          nothing, nothing sinister in any way
 8          the way you are trying to imply this
 9          about the way in which documents were
10          produced in this case.
11                 Sometimes on rare occasions as
12          Mr. Salzmann has testified a
13          particular document may not exist or
14          we can't find it any more.  That's it.
15                 MR. GREENSTONE: We don't need
16          to get into an argument about it, but
17          if I hadn't caught the first mistake,
18          you never would have given me the
19          documents about the fuel oil service
20          pumps and when you did, they are
21          incomplete.  The only point I'm
22          making, it's not you, Joe, it's not
23          the witness.  I'm making a very
24          specific point about what can or
0266
 1          cannot be proven in this case and I'm
 2          entitled to do that.
 3                 MR. COLAO: I don't know if you
 4          are entitled to do it at this witness'
 5          deposition.  I think that's the
 6          problem, but go ahead.
 7          Q.    Mr. Salzmann, is it accurate
 8   that we have bills of materials for all of
 9   the equipment that De Laval sold to the
10   United States Navy for the WILLIS A LEE
11   except the bill of material for the fuel oil
12   service pump that would have been in the fire
13   rooms of the WILLIS A LEE?
14                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
15          and answered.  The answer is yes.
16          Answer it again.
17          A.    Again, I'm not privy to where
18   all the specific equipment was, fire room or
19   non fire room or wherever it was, but yes,
20   the bill of material for the fuel oil service
21   pumps could not be found.  It was missing
22   from where it was supposed to be.
23          Q.    That bill of materials would be
24   the document that would tell us one way or
0267
 1   the other if there were spare packing
 2   provided by De Laval, true?
 3          A.    Yes, that would tell you
 4   definitively, but I have already said that
 5   that is likely the case.
 6          Q.    I'm sorry, I misunderstood your
 7   earlier testimony.  We knew that there was in
 8   fact packing that was asbestos containing
 9   supplied as a component of the De Laval
10   turbines at the time they were sold.  Is it
11   now also your testimony that it's likely that
12   De Laval also supplied spare replacement
13   asbestos packing with these fuel oil service
14   pumps?
15          A.    For the valve stems that's the
16   norm.  I cannot say specifically and exactly
17   for these exact pumps, but that is typically
18   the case.
19          Q.    It's likely that that was the
20   case in this case?
21          A.    It's likely that was the case
22   here.
23          Q.    It's likely that De Laval
24   provided fuel oil service pump turbines that
0268
 1   contained asbestos packing and it's also
 2   likely that they provided replacement
 3   asbestos packing for the WILLIS A LEE?
 4          A.    That is likely.
 5          Q.    Would you also agree, sir, that
 6   De Laval knew and intended that the turbines
 7   on their fuel oil service pumps would be
 8   insulated with asbestos?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
10          and answered.
11          A.    The word intended is a
12   mischaracterization.
13          Q.    Let me re-ask the question.
14   Would you agree, sir, that with respect to
15   the particular fuel oil service pump turbines
16   that were on the WILLIS A LEE, De Laval knew
17   and intended that those turbines would be
18   insulated with asbestos?
19                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
20          A.    I don't think we intended one
21   way or the other, but there's a note on the
22   order card that says the following equipment
23   will be supplied by the ship builder and it
24   includes insulation and lagging.
0269
 1          Q.    Again, the document that's
 2   Exhibit 14 that you are looking at, that's a
 3   De Laval document, correct?
 4          A.    This, yes, this is a De Laval
 5   document.
 6          Q.    Is it correct to call it a
 7   purchase order or do you call it a purchase
 8   card?
 9          A.    It's an order card.
10          Q.    It's a De Laval order card that
11   you were reading from?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    On the De Laval order card it
14   indicates that De Laval knew that the
15   turbines would be insulated, true?
16          A.    Yes, that if the ship builder
17   followed through with whatever plan he had at
18   the time that they would be insulated and it
19   says so here.
20          Q.    With respect to the particular
21   pumps and turbines that are at issue in the
22   Balthazar case, the fuel oil service pumps
23   that would have been in the fire rooms on the
24   WILLIS A LEE, the order card confirms that De
0270
 1   Laval would have known that those turbines
 2   would have been insulated, true?
 3                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 4          A.    Yes, it says the following
 5   equipment will be supplied by the ship
 6   builder, yes.
 7          Q.    Under that section about what
 8   will be supplied by the ship builder, it
 9   mentions lagging and insulation?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
11          and answered.
12          A.    Yes, it does.
13          Q.    It doesn't say may be supplied
14   by the ship builder or can potentially be, it
15   says it will be supplied?
16          A.    That's what it says.
17          Q.    Does the order card that you
18   looked at for the fuel oil service pumps and
19   turbines, does it reference temperature
20   ranges and pressures for the De Laval pumps
21   and turbines that are on the WILLIS A LEE?
22          A.    Yes.
23          Q.    Can you tell me what those
24   pressure and temperature ranges would have
0271
 1   been?
 2          A.    Yes, this looks like boiler
 3   steam 1050 PSIG and 940 degrees super heat.
 4          Q.    Is that for the pump or the
 5   turbine?
 6          A.    That's for the turbine.  The
 7   pump operates essentially at room
 8   temperature.
 9          Q.    So this certainly would have
10   been the turbine that De Laval would have
11   anticipated would have been insulated as you
12   and I discussed, true?
13                 MR. COLAO: Objection; asked
14          and answered.
15          A.    Subject to location and access
16   and all those other things, yes, not because
17   it had to be to function.
18          Q.    They would know the insulation
19   would be asbestos containing most likely,
20   true?
21          A.    Again, at this period in time
22   these are much later ships than some of the
23   earlier ones I've looked at, I don't know
24   what they were using and I can't say from
0272
 1   this information because again, it was to be
 2   supplied by the ship builder.
 3          Q.    There's a reference there to
 4   and I apologize I have to hand it back and
 5   forth to you there's a reference here I think
 6   under specifications on the same exhibit it
 7   says the equipment shall be in accordance
 8   with the following specifications as amended
 9   to September 1948 except as modified herein
10   and it says -- has a number of specifications
11   that are listed and specifically it
12   references thermal insulation for machinery
13   and piping, true?
14          A.    Yes, it does.
15          Q.    Do you know as you sit here
16   today whether those drawings and
17   specifications would have indicated that
18   asbestos was the type of insulation that
19   would be used or can you say?
20          A.    No, I don't know.  These look
21   like Navy specifications, general Navy
22   specifications.
23          Q.    As you sit here today, you're
24   not aware of any type of insulation other
0273
 1   than asbestos that would have been used for
 2   that type of application as indicated in that
 3   document?
 4          A.    The only other type of
 5   insulation I have seen used is rock wall on
 6   various and sundry turbines.
 7          Q.    You and I talked about that
 8   before.  You've never seen rock wall used as
 9   insulation for the turbine of a fuel oil
10   service pump?
11          A.    I can't recall that I have, no.
12          Q.    As you sit here today, the only
13   insulation that you're familiar with being
14   used on the turbines for fuel oil service
15   pumps would be asbestos containing
16   insulation?
17                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
18          Q.    True?
19          A.    To the best of my knowledge,
20   yes.
21          Q.    Does the order card also
22   indicate that De Laval is providing technical
23   manuals?
24          A.    I can't recall, but yes.
0274
 1          Q.    They would have provided a
 2   number of technical manuals to a number of
 3   different sources relating to their pumps and
 4   turbines, true?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 6          I thought it was -- I found it to be a
 7          vague question,
 8                 MR. GREENSTONE: I'll re-ask
 9          it.
10          Q.    Would you agree, sir, that as
11   indicated in the De Laval order card for the
12   fuel oil service pumps that would have been
13   on my client's ships, De Laval indicates in
14   that order card that they will provide a
15   number of different technical manuals or
16   copies of technical manuals to various
17   sources?
18          A.    I don't -- it appears from this
19   that all of the instruction books were
20   provided to Gibson Cox.
21          Q.    They didn't just give one copy
22   of that to Gibson Cox, they gave a number of
23   copies?
24          A.    They gave a number of them,
0275
 1   yes.
 2          Q.    Were you aware that the
 3   technical manuals ultimately are supposed to
 4   end up in a number of different places
 5   including some on the ship, some at various
 6   locations?
 7          A.    I'm sure there were and I'm not
 8   sure where all the places were.
 9          Q.    Nonetheless no question that
10   for these particular ships De Laval would
11   have provided technical manuals?
12          A.    That's correct.
13          Q.    Would you agree, sir, that if
14   there was a military specification during
15   that period of time that governed the
16   creation of technical manuals for machinery
17   and equipment, De Laval would have been bound
18   to follow it?
19          A.    Yes.
20          Q.    Do you know whether the mil
21   spec for technical manuals that was in
22   existence at the time that the ship was built
23   indicated anything about whether De Laval
24   should provide safety notices in their
0276
 1   technical manuals?
 2          A.    I don't know.
 3          Q.    You don't know one way or the
 4   other?
 5          A.    I don't know one way or the
 6   other.
 7          Q.    Is it also accurate that De
 8   Laval often provided an engineer to supervise
 9   or to be present during the installation of
10   De Laval equipment including fuel oil service
11   pumps and turbines?
12          A.    Depends on the time period.  In
13   later years -- and depends on the customer
14   too of course and the expertise of the
15   customer, but we had that service available.
16          Q.    When you were working there in
17   the 1960s, did De Laval sometimes provide
18   engineers to be present and supervise the
19   installation of De Laval pumps and turbines?
20          A.    Yes.
21          Q.    Were you ever the person that
22   they had go out there and do that?
23          A.    No, not for the normal stuff,
24   but if there were some particular problem
0277
 1   I've ended up in the field on a number of
 2   occasions.
 3          Q.    Do you know if De Laval
 4   engineers would ever have gone on sea trials
 5   on Navy ships?
 6          A.    From time to time I believe
 7   they did, yes.
 8          Q.    Would you agree that as
 9   referenced in the order card in this
10   particular circumstance for the De Laval
11   pumps that would have been in the fire room
12   on the WILLIS A LEE that a provision is made
13   in that order for a De Laval engineer to be
14   present during the installation of the pump?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          A.    Yes, it says the services of a
17   competent engineer and by the way, most of
18   these folks are not graduate engineers, but
19   they are very knowledgeable equipment people,
20   but they call them service engineers, to
21   supervise installation at the shipyard shall
22   be furnished when required and authorized by
23   the purchasing shipyard.
24          Q.    So in this particular
0278
 1   circumstance the order card itself indicates
 2   that De Laval will make an engineer available
 3   to supervise installation?
 4          A.    Yes, yes, as requested by the
 5   shipyard.
 6          Q.    That's even after they sold the
 7   pump and the turbine, correct?
 8          A.    They sold the pump before they
 9   made it so yes, this would be after they sold
10   the pump.
11          Q.    De Laval is agreeing to have
12   their engineer present during installation if
13   requested subsequently to the sale going
14   forward?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    You can't say in this
18   particular instance that a De Laval engineer
19   was not present during installation, true?
20          A.    No, just as I can't say that
21   there was one.
22          Q.    All we know is that the order
23   card indicates that De Laval was making an
24   engineer available to supervise installation?
0279
 1          A.    Correct.  What's normally done
 2   you provide a per diem rate and if the
 3   customer wants the engineer there for some
 4   specific part or all of the installation they
 5   would call you and then they would be
 6   dispatched, the engineer would be dispatched
 7   for that task.
 8          Q.    Do you know if Bethlehem
 9   Shipyard ever did that?
10          A.    I don't know specifically.
11          Q.    Certainly is it accurate to say
12   that at least on occasion De Laval engineers
13   supervised the installation of De Laval pumps
14   and turbines to customers including the
15   United States Navy?
16          A.    Certainly I'm sure that they
17   did.  Specific instances I'm not aware of.
18          Q.    If De Laval engineers were
19   present during installation of a pump and a
20   turbine, then they would know if that turbine
21   was insulated with asbestos, true?
22          A.    If they happened to be there
23   late in the game, that's possible.
24          Q.    If they went on a sea trial for
0280
 1   a particular ship, then they would know that
 2   as well, true?
 3          A.    If they went on a sea trial,
 4   yes.
 5          Q.    They would know whether or not
 6   the pump and turbine were insulated with
 7   asbestos, true?
 8          A.    Certainly, they were in the
 9   engine room.
10          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
11   that military specifications for pumps and
12   turbines for use in the United States Navy
13   were developed through a collaborative effort
14   between industry including De Laval and the
15   United States Navy?
16                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
17          A.    What was that question?
18          Q.    A little complicated, but I
19   think it's clear enough.  Would you agree
20   with me, sir, that to the extent that there
21   are military specifications for pumps and
22   turbines that are used on Navy ships, those
23   were developed by a collaboration between
24   industry including De Laval and the United
0281
 1   States Navy?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
 3          A.    I don't know.  Back in that day
 4   I don't know how the thing was developed.
 5          Q.    Would you agree with me, sir,
 6   that De Laval was the expert relating to
 7   their pumps and turbines, not the United
 8   States Navy?
 9          A.    Certainly relative to our
10   products, sure, we were more expert than they
11   were certainly in the design.
12          Q.    Would you agree that in fact
13   the Navy relied on De Laval for the design of
14   pumps and turbines?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form;
16          asking what he knew about the Navy or
17          what the Navy knew, I'm sorry.
18          A.    We did the design so is that
19   the answer to your question?
20          Q.    I'm asking if you know whether
21   or not the Navy actually relied upon De Laval
22   for the design of pumps and turbines that
23   were used on Navy ships?
24                 MR. COLAO: Object as to what
0282
 1          he knew the Navy knew.
 2                 MR. GREENSTONE: If you know,
 3          sir.
 4          A.    Again, that was before my time,
 5   but certainly De Laval designed the pumps and
 6   turbines so the customer relied on us to come
 7   up with a design that would do the function
 8   that they specified and in the Navy's case
 9   and in other customers' cases not only the
10   function, but some of the details of design.
11          Q.    Were you aware, sir, that the
12   Navy in fact paid for part of De Laval's
13   facility in New Jersey?
14          A.    I didn't know that, but they
15   were trying in the war years I'm sure to
16   increase production of all kinds of things.
17                 MR. GREENSTONE: Let me show
18          you what I'll mark as Exhibit 15 to
19          the deposition and I believe it's the
20          last document that I'm going to talk
21          to you about.
22                 (Plaintiff's Exhibit 15,
23          Document, marked for Identification.)
24          A.    Are we done with these?
0283
 1          Q.    Yes.  Have you ever seen this
 2   document before, sir, and if you need to take
 3   a second to look at it, that's fine?
 4          A.    I don't think I have ever seen
 5   this before.
 6          Q.    Let's take a look at it.  It
 7   says at the top from Chairman, Naval
 8   Industrial Reserve Plant Review Board to
 9   Assistant Secretary of the Navy.  Subject: De
10   Laval Steam Turbine Company, Trenton, New
11   Jersey DOD 225; report of review.  Did I read
12   that correctly?
13          A.    Yes.
14          Q.    It's difficult to read, I know.
15   Then it says number one, review, in
16   accordance with reference A, the Naval
17   Industrial Reserve Plant Review Board visited
18   subject facility on 20 October 1954 and
19   reviewed the status of the plant.  Two,
20   nature and size of plant.  This is a
21   privately owned plant for research,
22   development, design and production of steam
23   turbines, reduction gears, turbo generator
24   sets up to 11,500 and I think that says EW?
0284
 1          A.    KW.
 2          Q.    KW, centrifugal and IMO rotary
 3   pumps of all sizes, centrifugal blowers and
 4   compressors, diesel engine super chargers and
 5   worm gear transmissions.  Did I read all that
 6   correctly?
 7          A.    Yes.
 8                 MR. COLAO: Note my continuing
 9          objection to questions regarding the
10          document that he said he had not seen
11          before.
12          Q.    The plant consists of 54 acres
13   of contractor owned lands with an additional
14   38 acres available for expansion.  It has
15   30,500 square feet of office space and
16   441,000 square feet of production space of
17   which 33,350 square feet was provided through
18   Navy expansion.
19                The plant was founded in 1901
20   to build turbines and gears.  In 1940 the
21   Navy financed the extension of six buildings
22   at a cost of $229,000 and provided machine
23   tools and production equipment costing
24   514,000 to increase the productive capacity.
0285
 1                Do you know, sir, if they are
 2   talking about the facility in Trenton, New
 3   Jersey, the De Laval facility in Trenton, New
 4   Jersey?
 5                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 6          Q.    Can you tell from the context?
 7          A.    I believe that's the only one
 8   that existed at the time.
 9          Q.    The De Laval plant in Trenton,
10   New Jersey was in fact founded in 1901 to
11   build turbines and gears, true?
12          A.    Yes.
13          Q.    Were you aware about the
14   expansion that took place in 1940?
15          A.    No.
16          Q.    You certainly didn't know that
17   the Navy actually financed that expansion?
18          A.    No.
19          Q.    The next page talks about,
20   sorry, I missed a line at the bottom of the
21   first page.  The plant is being used for its
22   designed purpose.  About 60 percent --
23          A.    Where are you?
24          Q.    Bottom of page 1.  The plant is
0286
 1   being used for its designed purpose.  About
 2   60 percent of current production is for the
 3   government.  Present employment is 2,100.
 4   Then three it says extent of the Navy's
 5   interest.  The Navy sold the building
 6   extensions and the production equipment and
 7   machine tools to De Laval on July 1, 1947 for
 8   $215,000 subject to a national security
 9   clause for 20 years on the building
10   extensions and for 10 years on the machine
11   tools and production equipment.  The Navy's
12   interest is limited to that created by the
13   national security clause in the sales
14   documents.  Do you see all of that, sir?
15          A.    Yes.
16          Q.    I know you have not seen this
17   document before, but from looking at the
18   document now, does it indicate to you that
19   the Navy in fact financed part of De Laval's
20   facility so that De Laval could design,
21   research and develop equipment including
22   turbines and pumps and things of that nature?
23                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
24          A.    Yes, it appears that the Navy
0287
 1   actually -- this expansion in 1940 it appears
 2   that the Navy did and owned until 1947,
 3   that's the way I read it.
 4          Q.    It says it's a privately owned
 5   plant that the Navy sold equipment to De
 6   Laval for?
 7          A.    Yes and it appears that
 8   whatever extension that the Navy did at its
 9   cost in 1940 to enhance war production I
10   presume was then sold to De Laval in 1947.
11          Q.    It says -- let's make sure
12   we're clear what we're talking about, sir.
13   It doesn't say that the Navy owned the plant,
14   it says in 1940 the Navy financed the
15   extension of six buildings, true?
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    And provided machine tools and
18   production equipment?
19          A.    Yes, it sounds like the Navy
20   did that.  If you look over on number three,
21   it sold those buildings extensions and
22   production equipment to De Laval.
23          Q.    So whereas De Laval --
24          A.    So presumably between 1940 and
0288
 1   1947 the Navy owned the facility.
 2          Q.    They rented it out or leased it
 3   to De Laval?
 4          A.    Presumably some kind of
 5   arrangement like that.
 6          Q.    Eventually in '47 they actually
 7   sold it outright to De Laval?
 8          A.    That's the way I would
 9   interpret it from a first look here.
10          Q.    Does that indicate -- it also
11   indicates that the Navy's interest is limited
12   to that created by the national security
13   clause?
14          A.    Yes and I'm not sure what that
15   means at all.
16          Q.    Sir, does this document
17   indicate to you that the United States Navy
18   actually relied upon De Laval to design and
19   produce equipment including turbines and
20   pumps?
21                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
22          A.    Yes, as it did on many other
23   manufacturers I would suspect in the war
24   years.
0289
 1          Q.    To the extent that the Navy had
 2   specifications that controlled pumps and
 3   turbines and things of that nature on Naval
 4   vessels, wouldn't it seem clear that it was
 5   in fact industry including De Laval that
 6   designed those pumps and turbines and then
 7   provided that information to the Navy who
 8   then could create specifications?
 9                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form
10          and the mischaracterization of the
11          document and prior testimony.?
12          A.    I think that's a convoluted
13   scenario.
14          Q.    Let's try to unconvolute it.
15   If the Navy knew enough about pumps and
16   turbines to make their own, why would they
17   need De Laval to be the ones designing and
18   producing turbines?
19                 MR. COLAO: Objection; calls
20          for speculation as to what the Navy
21          knew.
22          A.    The Navy is not in the business
23   of manufacturing equipment.  They are in the
24   business of sailing ships and going to war.
0290
 1          Q.    That's exactly right, isn't it,
 2   sir, that it's actually De Laval that's in
 3   the business of manufacturing and designing
 4   equipment, true?
 5          A.    Yes.
 6          Q.    To the extent that the Navy has
 7   detailed drawings relating to turbines and
 8   pumps and things of that nature, it has to be
 9   industry that gives that to them to begin
10   with, true?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection as to his
12          knowledge of what the Navy had or what
13          the reasons for that would have been.
14          A.    You're trying to make very
15   simple what I'm sure is a convoluted process
16   that evolved over decades.  With the Navy at
17   the time of the war I'm sure had been
18   building and building ships or having ships
19   built for them and purchasing equipment from
20   numerous manufacturers and so by the time of
21   this era the 1940s came around, the Navy had
22   many machinery experts and I'm sure they had
23   a bureau that consisted of engineers down
24   there who considered themselves machinery
0291
 1   experts so I'm sure there was a lot of give
 2   and take.
 3          Q.    That's fair enough, sir.  I
 4   think that's where my question started, would
 5   you agree with me, sir, that the
 6   specifications for design of pumps and
 7   turbines that would go on Navy vessels were
 8   made by a collaborative effort between the
 9   Navy and industry such as De Laval?
10                 MR. COLAO: Objection as to
11          this witness' knowledge of that.  Go
12          ahead.
13                 MR. GREENSTONE: He just
14          testified to it.
15          A.    I don't know the procedure.
16   You talk about a collaborative effort and I
17   don't know how collaborative it was.  I'm
18   sure the Navy wrote specifications right,
19   wrong or indifferent, De Laval proposed
20   equipment.  If the Navy accepted it, they
21   perhaps wrote into their specifications some
22   features of De Laval equipment or other
23   people's equipment that they liked.
24   Collaborative I think is a word that I can't
0292
 1   agree with because I don't know.
 2          Q.    The only -- would you agree
 3   with this, sir, the only reason the Navy
 4   would help finance a De Laval facility
 5   specifically for research, development,
 6   design and production of steam turbines,
 7   reduction gears, pumps, etc. is because the
 8   Navy clearly needed industries help including
 9   De Laval with the research, development,
10   design and production of this equipment?
11                 MR. COLAO: Objection; beyond
12          this witness' knowledge and calls for
13          speculation.
14          A.    Again, I don't know the reasons
15   why all this was done.  My perception would
16   be that the major reason was because there
17   was insufficient capacity in the country to
18   produce all of the equipment of this type
19   that was needed for the war effort in 1940
20   and someone recognized that and said we have
21   to build more plant capacity and did it.
22          Q.    Was this document and the
23   document does speak for itself, but you can
24   look at it, does this document just talk
0293
 1   about production of this equipment?
 2          A.    No, but in order to produce,
 3   you have to do other functions or perform
 4   other functions.
 5          Q.    This document actually says
 6   research, development, design and production
 7   of various equipment including turbines and
 8   pumps, true?
 9          A.    That's what it says, yes.
10          Q.    Very clearly from this document
11   the Navy relied to some extent on industry
12   including De Laval for research, development,
13   design and production of equipment that it
14   was using on its ships?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection as to
16          what the Navy relied upon.
17          A.    Yes.
18          Q.    Let me shift gears just for a
19   minute or two and talk about Mr. McDaniel's
20   case.  Did you actually undertake any type of
21   records review to see if there were any De
22   Laval documents relating to the facilities
23   that Mr. McDaniel talked about, namely the
24   Carolina Eastman plant and the Hertz facility
0294
 1   in South Carolina?
 2          A.    Yes, a search was done.
 3          Q.    Are those documents kept in a
 4   different place than the Navy documents?
 5          A.    No.
 6          Q.    They are all kept in the same
 7   facility in New Jersey?
 8          A.    Yes, same general area for
 9   turbine division equipment.
10          Q.    Does De Laval maintain records
11   of all of the pumps and turbines that it sold
12   to different customers such as Daniel
13   Construction or such as Carolina Eastman or
14   the Hertz facility?
15                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    Do you know if the records are
18   complete?
19          A.    They are quite complete.
20          Q.    When do the records start?
21          A.    When do they start. I have seen
22   -- I've personally pulled documents that go
23   back to 1906.  Can't find one that goes
24   earlier than that, but they go back quite
0295
 1   far.
 2          Q.    To be fair now, you couldn't
 3   find all of the documents relating to all of
 4   the equipment in the Balthazar case, could
 5   you?
 6          A.    No, that's correct.
 7          Q.    In fact, there was a turbine
 8   that's referenced that's clearly in the Navy
 9   synopsis that you didn't locate, there was a
10   bill of materials that you didn't locate for
11   some of the products that you did find, true?
12          A.    I think the extent of the
13   missing information is that bill of materials
14   for the fuel oil service, yes.
15          Q.    Also the turbine, correct, the
16   De Laval turbine for the Worthington fire
17   pump, that's missing too, correct?
18          A.    That's correct.
19          Q.    It doesn't mean that those
20   products aren't there, it just means that you
21   didn't find the documents?
22          A.    That's correct.
23          Q.    It's accurate that the records
24   that you keep of sales to customers are not
0296
 1   necessarily all inclusive, true?
 2          A.    They are quite good, but they
 3   are not perfect.
 4          Q.    Did you note sales in the South
 5   Carolina area?
 6          A.    We looked for sales at those
 7   locations.  In addition to those companies we
 8   looked for sales to those areas and did not
 9   find any in those specific plant sites.
10          Q.    To be fair that doesn't
11   necessarily mean that De Laval products were
12   not at those facilities, it just means that
13   you couldn't find any records relating to
14   those sales?
15          A.    We didn't find any indication
16   that there were, yes.
17          Q.    Again, that wasn't my question.
18   My question was that doesn't necessarily mean
19   that the products were not there, it just
20   means that you couldn't find the records,
21   true?
22          A.    Yes and I don't want to leave
23   the impression that this is haphazard.  What
24   I'm saying is that there are a vast majority
0297
 1   of records that we do find for any given site
 2   or customer.  These sites we did not find any
 3   records.
 4          Q.    Are they listed by site?
 5          A.    They are listed by customer.
 6          Q.    Which customers did you look
 7   for in this case?
 8          A.    The ones that were specified
 9   Carolina Eastman and actually we looked under
10   a couple of different spellings of the other
11   one because it didn't seem right to us Hertz
12   or Herz.
13          Q.    I'm guessing you didn't look
14   for anything relating to Daniel Construction?
15          A.    I don't know that for a fact.
16          Q.    As you sit here today, you're
17   not aware that you did, correct?
18          A.    I don't recall, that's correct.
19          Q.    So if a pump was sold for
20   example to a contractor who then sold that
21   pump to a premises, then you might not
22   necessarily have found it in this case if you
23   didn't know the name of the contractor it was
24   sold to?
0298
 1                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 2          Q.    Is that accurate?
 3          A.    That's a possibility.
 4          Q.    For example, you didn't and
 5   again --
 6          A.    Records are generally kept by
 7   the ultimate customer, not the contractor
 8   involved, but as I said anything is possible.
 9          Q.    Certainly you don't necessarily
10   track and it would be impossible really to
11   track where your pumps went after they would
12   have been sold to a contractor who was going
13   to put them other places, true?
14          A.    As I said before, generally
15   this equipment is built specifically for an
16   application.  It's not something that you
17   pick off the shelf and ship it out that
18   people stock so it's built for a specific set
19   of conditions and those conditions are
20   usually associated with a site so even if
21   equipment is sold to a contractor which is
22   common, in many cases the equipment is bought
23   by people like Fluor or Bechtel or big
24   contractors for installation in specific
0299
 1   plants, but the records are generally kept
 2   when we know where the ultimate site is which
 3   is the norm, then the records are kept by the
 4   ultimate customer.
 5          Q.    You mentioned Fluor.  Do you
 6   know what if any relationship Fluor has with
 7   Daniel Construction?
 8          A.    It may be the combination there
 9   of what's now Fluor Daniel.
10          Q.    Do you know if Daniel
11   Construction was one of the world's largest
12   construction contractors during the time
13   period that my client worked for them?
14          A.    I didn't know what the
15   specific --
16          Q.    You certainly did not look for
17   any sales to Daniel Construction, true?
18          A.    Not that I know of or can
19   recall.
20          Q.    You don't recall making any
21   such search, true?
22          A.    I don't.  I'm not sure we were
23   aware of that name.
24          Q.    If there had been sales to
0300
 1   Daniel Construction, then you don't
 2   necessarily know where Daniel would have then
 3   sold those products, true?
 4                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 5          A.    That's an unlikely event, but
 6   again, as I said before, I've been around
 7   long enough never to say never, but generally
 8   if we had any indication that it would end up
 9   at, for example, Carolina Eastman, that order
10   number would have been logged in under
11   Carolina Eastman even if it was sold to Fluor
12   Daniel.
13          Q.    Even though Carolina Eastman
14   would not have been the actual customer?
15          A.    If Carolina Eastman was not the
16   actual customer?
17          Q.    If the one who paid for the
18   pump was Daniel, wouldn't Daniel be the name
19   that you had to look for in your records?
20          A.    No, that's the norm that the
21   contractor especially with the large
22   equipment, if large equipment goes in, it's
23   the norm that the contractor actually places
24   the purchase order and the bill and places --
0301
 1   and pays the bill.
 2          Q.    Did De Laval sell equipment to
 3   South Carolina, did they sell it in that
 4   region?
 5          A.    In the state?
 6          Q.    Sure.
 7          A.    I'm sure there was De Laval
 8   equipment in the state of Carolina.
 9          Q.    State of South Carolina?
10          A.    State of South Carolina.
11          Q.    Is there any state in the
12   country that you are aware of that De Laval
13   did not sell equipment?
14          A.    No, not specifically.
15          Q.    Is there some sort of index
16   like you mentioned before like a file cabinet
17   or something that had cards in it that were
18   order cards that are kept in a cubby hole
19   somewhere at the De Laval facility?
20          A.    Yes.
21          Q.    Is that something that can be
22   -- how many documents are there, how many
23   cards are there?
24          A.    Many thousands.
0302
 1          Q.    It's certainly something that
 2   could be copied, correct?
 3          A.    I wouldn't want to copy these,
 4   but --
 5          Q.    Not you personally?
 6          A.    Nothing again is impossible.
 7          Q.    Certainly the -- and is there
 8   with respect to the land based documents, is
 9   there an index that helps you or do you just
10   open up the file cabinet and start looking?
11          A.    Again, there's an index card
12   file that goes by customer.
13          Q.    I understand.  I'm just saying
14   is there an index where there's a few pieces
15   of paper that indicates everything that's in
16   the card files?
17          A.    No.
18          Q.    It's like similar to the way at
19   a library, you just open up a card file and
20   look through it for the customer's name?
21          A.    Yes.
22          Q.    When did you conduct the search
23   relating to the McDaniel cause?
24          A.    I don't know.  I can't recall.
0303
 1   I know it was done, but some months ago I
 2   suspect, but I don't know.
 3          Q.    Is the Carolina Eastman
 4   facility the type of facility that De Laval
 5   pumps would be used in if you know?
 6                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 7          A.    I don't know what kind of
 8   facility it is frankly.
 9          Q.    You can't say one way or the
10   other?
11          A.    No.
12          Q.    What about the Hertz facility?
13          A.    I have no idea what that is.
14   There were no adjectives attached to it that
15   would describe what kind of company it is.
16          Q.    Certainly a large construction
17   contractor such as Daniel is the type of
18   customer that De Laval often sold to, true?
19                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
20          Mischaracterizes what he already said.
21          Q.    Is that correct, sir?
22          A.    Yes, we have sold equipment
23   where Fluor Daniel has been the installing
24   contractor or the purchasing contractor or
0304
 1   whatever.
 2          Q.    If there were turbines that
 3   were associated with De Laval pumps at a
 4   facility such as Carolina Eastman or this
 5   Hertz facility, then again, those turbines
 6   would have operating temperatures at least
 7   over 212 degrees, fair?
 8                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 9          A.    Most likely.
10          Q.    Again, if there were such
11   turbines, then they would most likely have
12   asbestos packing inside them, true?
13                 MR. COLAO: Same objection.
14          A.    No.  You are broadening this to
15   all turbines and only the relatively small
16   turbines have packing anywhere inside them.
17   You get to a larger machine and it's very --
18   it just doesn't happen.  You don't have the
19   typical type of packing that you are
20   referring to.
21          Q.    To be fair we don't really know
22   the size of any of the pumps that were De
23   Laval pumps and turbines at any of Mr.
24   McDaniel's facilities if in fact there were
0305
 1   even any there, true?
 2                 MR. COLAO: Objection to form.
 3          A.    That's right, we don't know
 4   whether they were even there and if they were
 5   there, we don't know what the size of them
 6   was or what they contained.
 7                 MR. GREENSTONE: Thank you for
 8          your time, sir.  I think that's all I
 9          have.
10                 MR. COLAO: Anybody else?  I
11          think we are done.

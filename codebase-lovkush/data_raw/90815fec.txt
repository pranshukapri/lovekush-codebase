             4                  JOEL D. FECHTER, M.D.

             5    a witness, called for examination, having been

             6    first duly sworn, was examined and testified as

             7    follows:

             8                      EXAMINATION

             9             BY MS. KYLIS:

            10        Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Fechter.  We were

            11    introduced briefly off the record, but for the

            12    record my name is Kelly Kylis and along with

            13    Jennifer Alexander I represent the Defendant in

            14    the case that we have called you here for today.

            15             To begin, would you please state your

            16    name and business address.

            17        A.   Sure.  Joel Fechter.  We're at my

            18    office in Silver Spring at 10301 Georgia Avenue.

            19    We have an office in Bowie as well.

            20        Q.   Is this Silver Spring office your

            21    primary location?

            22        A.   It's the main office, yeah.



                                                                  4





             1        Q.   Okay.  Now, I know you've had your

             2    deposition taken before on a number of

             3    occasions, but just to make me feel better we'll

             4    go through a couple quick ground rules.  The

             5    first is that all of your responses must be

             6    verbal.  Madam court reporter cannot take down

             7    nods of the head or nonverbal responses like

             8    uh-huh.  So all of your responses must be yes,

             9    no or whatever the answer may be.

            10             Secondly, we cannot talk over one

            11    another.  I know it's natural in conversation

            12    that we anticipate each other's responses, but

            13    we have to act like it's a shortwave radio and

            14    keep the record clear for madam court reporter.

            15        A.   Okay.

            16        Q.   Great.  If you don't understand any of

            17    my questions, please ask me to rephrase them.

            18    It's very important that we are on the same page

            19    so that the record is clear, and I will not be

            20    offended if you tell me I ask a bad question and

            21    you don't know what I'm talking about.

            22        A.   Okay.



                                                                  5





             1        Q.   Finally, I don't think we'll be here

             2    very long, but if you need a break for any

             3    reason whatsoever, please let me know and we'll

             4    be happy to accommodate you.

             5        A.   Thank you.

             6             (Deposition Exhibit Number 1 was marked

             7    for identification.)

             8             BY MS. KYLIS:

             9        Q.   Great.  Now, I will show you what I've

            10    marked as Exhibit 1 to your deposition.  This is

            11    your subpoena and notice of deposition,

            12    essentially your invitation to be here today.

            13    Have you seen that before?

            14        A.   It's probably in my file.  I don't

            15    really know that I looked at it.

            16        Q.   Okay.  Well, since you have it in front

            17    of you, there is a document schedule attached to

            18    it.  I see that you brought a stack of documents

            19    with you.  Can you tell me what you've brought

            20    today?

            21        A.   I have all of the medical records in

            22    her file.



                                                                  6





             1        Q.   Now, I believe your medical records

             2    were provided to me already, so I think we're

             3    probably on the same page.  Do you have any kind

             4    of transmittal letter that would detail what's

             5    in your records?

             6        A.   I don't think so.  I don't think I do,

             7    not that I remember seeing.  I have a letter

             8    from Mr. Kolker, but I don't think -- it doesn't

             9    really detail exactly what records are here.

            10        Q.   Okay.  I saw that letter and I'm going

            11    to go ahead and believe that we have the same

            12    stack of records that your office provided.

            13        A.   It looks like it's about the same

            14    height.

            15        Q.   It sure does.  A couple inches, three,

            16    four maybe?

            17        A.   Yeah.

            18        Q.   Great.  Other than the records that you

            19    brought with you, do you have any documents,

            20    notes, journals, calendars, anything like that

            21    regarding Ms. Vaughn in your care, custody or

            22    control?



                                                                  7





             1        A.   Other than what's here?

             2        Q.   Correct.

             3        A.   No, I don't think so.

             4        Q.   Okay.  Great.  Now, I have been

             5    provided -- I think your office provided me a

             6    copy of your CV.  I mean, I also got it from

             7    Plaintiff's counsel.  I'm going to mark that as

             8    Exhibit 2 to your deposition.  But before I hand

             9    that over to you, can you just give me briefly

            10    your educational background.

            11        A.   Sure.  I went to University of Maryland

            12    in College Park, graduated in 1984.  University

            13    of Maryland School of Medicine, graduated in

            14    1988, did an internship and residency at LA

            15    County USC Medical Center, which was completed

            16    in June of '93, residency in orthopedic surgery,

            17    and then an orthopedic sports medicine

            18    fellowship at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic

            19    in Inglewood, California, completed in July of

            20    '94.

            21        Q.   Excellent.  I know you are board

            22    certified; is that right?



                                                                  8





             1        A.   I am.

             2        Q.   In what specialty are you board

             3    certified?

             4        A.   Orthopedic surgery.

             5        Q.   And what entity is it that governs that

             6    certification?

             7        A.   The American Board of Orthopedic

             8    Surgeons.

             9        Q.   And are you current in your

            10    certification?

            11        A.   I am.

            12        Q.   Do you have to recertify?

            13        A.   I do unfortunately.

            14        Q.   When is your next recertification?

            15        A.   I last recertified in 2015, so I guess

            16    that means my next one would be in about 10

            17    years.

            18        Q.   So 2025?

            19        A.   You can go a little earlier, but that's

            20    the period of certification through 2025.

            21        Q.   Understood.  Do you hold any state

            22    licenses?



                                                                  9





             1        A.   Actually maybe through 2026, I'm sorry.

             2    I have a license to practice medicine in

             3    Maryland and California.

             4        Q.   How often do you practice in

             5    California, if at all?

             6        A.   I don't anymore.

             7        Q.   Okay.  When did you get that license?

             8        A.   In my training, which was out in

             9    California.

            10        Q.   Is that something that you have to keep

            11    current?

            12        A.   It's the same requirements basically as

            13    a Maryland license.

            14        Q.   Okay.  So you do keep it current?

            15        A.   Oh, yeah.

            16        Q.   Do you maintain privileges at any

            17    hospitals?

            18        A.   Yes.  I have privileges at Holy Cross

            19    Hospital, Shady Grove Adventist and Suburban

            20    Hospital.

            10    and then I came here.  So post-education I've

            20        A.   Yes.  They're listed in my CV.

            21        Q.   Yes.  Of those listed in your CV -- I

            22    did not read them, I confess -- are any of those



                                                                 12





             1    publications related to the injuries claimed by

             2    Ms. Vaughn in this case?

             3        A.   Not really.  They're mostly shoulder

             4    and knee kind of things.

             5        Q.   Okay.  Before I forget, the CV that you

             6    have in front of you that I've marked as

             7    Deposition Exhibit 2, is that up to date?

             8        A.   It looks like it.

             9        Q.   Are there any changes or is there

            10    anything new that you have to add to this CV?

            11        A.   I don't think so.

            12        Q.   Great.  Now, Doctor, tell me about your

            13    current practice.  Do you -- in addition to

            14    seeing patients -- well, let me back up.  I

            15    assume in your practice you see patients.

            16        A.   That's right.

            17        Q.   Do you also have administrative duties?

            18        A.   Not really.

            19        Q.   Okay.  When you say not really, I mean,

            20    you are a partner in the practice.  Is there

            21    any -- you must do some administrative things

            22    or --



                                                                 13





             1        A.   So what do you mean by administrative

             2    things?

             3        Q.   That's an excellent point.  Not

             4    clinical work.  Time spent not seeing patients.

             5        A.   I mean, when I'm not seeing patients, I

             6    sometimes am dictating.  I mean, we have an

             7    office manager who runs the office.

             8        Q.   Understood.  Okay.  So would you say

             9    that your practice is 100 percent clinical?

            10        A.   I think I would.

            11        Q.   Okay.  I'm sure many doctors would be

            12    envious.

            13             Do you do any teaching in addition to

            14    your clinical practice?

            15        A.   Not really.

            16        Q.   Any research?

            17        A.   Not anymore.

            18        Q.   When was last time you did research or

            19    a research project?

            20        A.   I mean, I haven't done it since I

            21    finished my training really.

            22        Q.   Okay.  Now, as an orthopedic surgeon,



                                                                 14





             1    what type of procedures, surgical procedures, do

             2    you perform?

             3        A.   Most of my surgeries are to the

             4    shoulder and knee.  I do some other stuff on a

             5    less frequent basis, some surgeries involving

             6    wrists, elbows, but, I mean, I would say the

             7    majority are knee and shoulder cases.

             8        Q.   Okay.  Now, I've noticed -- very

             9    briefly, I've noticed that there are a lot of

            10    doctors who focus on the knee and shoulder

            11    together, and those aren't necessarily body

            12    parts that you would think go together.  Is

            13    there some reason why those two things tend to

            14    be?

            15        A.   They're two parts of the body that are

            16    commonly treated arthroscopically.  So a lot of

            17    people who have some extra training in

            18    arthroscopy or a particular interest in

            19    arthroscopy end up focusing on those joints

            20    because they're some of the more common joints

            21    in the body that end up getting arthroscopic

            22    treatment.



                                                                 15





             1        Q.   That makes perfect sense.  Thank you,

             2    Doctor.

             3        A.   Sure.

             4        Q.   Could you tell me, if you could

             5    estimate, what percentage of your practice is --

             6    or what percentage of the patients you see come

             7    to you for shoulder and knee treatment as

             8    compared to other body parts?

             9        A.   You know, it's pretty common.  I would

            10    say certainly every day I see people with knee

            11    and shoulder problems.  I don't know beyond

            12    telling you it's a frequent complaint how to

            13    answer that.

            14        Q.   Okay.  Now, we are obviously here for a

            15    lawsuit, so I know that you do some

            16    medical-legal consulting work.  Can you tell me

            17    how often you do medical-legal work?

            18        A.   So I don't really keep a tally or a

            19    count, but I have estimated in the past that in

            20    terms of what I do seeing patients maybe 10, 15

            21    percent, somewhere in that neighborhood is --

            22    would be evaluations for things like this, and



                                                                 16





             1    the balance would be treatment of patients who

             2    have been injured.

             3        Q.   So about 10 or 15 percent of your

             4    patients are here for things like IMEs?

             5        A.   That's what I would estimate.

             6        Q.   Okay.  I'm just making sure we're on

             7    the same page.  And have you been -- you have

             8    obviously been retained as an expert in this

             9    case.  You've been retained as an expert in

            10    prior cases, correct?

            11        A.   I have.

            12        Q.   Could you tell me -- well, let me back

            13    up.  You've been retained in this case by the

            14    Plaintiff.  Is all of your practice, your

            15    medical-legal consulting practice for plaintiffs

            16    or do you also do defense work?

            17        A.   I also do defense work.

            18        Q.   Can you give me an estimate as to what

            19    percentage of your medical-legal work is for

            20    plaintiffs versus defendants?

            21        A.   The significant majority is for

            22    plaintiffs or claimants.  I mean, I've estimated



                                                                 17





             1    in the past, and again I don't have a count, so

             2    it's just an estimation, you know, 5, 10, 12

             3    percent defense and the balance would be

             4    plaintiffs or claimants.

             5        Q.   Do you remember when your last defense

             6    case was?

             7        A.   The last defense evaluation that I did?

             8        Q.   Sure.  The last time you were retained

             9    and did some medical-legal work for -- on behalf

            10    of the defendant.

            11        A.   Probably a couple weeks ago.

            12        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever been qualified as

            13    an expert in court?

            14        A.   Yes.

            15        Q.   When was the last time you were

            16    qualified as an expert in court?

            17        A.   Do you mean -- I'm sorry, do you mean

            18    testifying in court or a deposition?

            19        Q.   Yes, I'm sorry.  I should have

            20    clarified that.  You have testified in court,

            21    have you not?

            22        A.   On occasion.



                                                                 18





             1        Q.   Okay.  And when you testified in court

             2    were you qualified as an expert by the judge?

             3        A.   Yes.

             4        Q.   When was the last time?

             5        A.   I probably haven't been to court for,

             6    I'm going to guess a year, 10 months, 11 months,

             7    12 months, something like that.

             8        Q.   What court was it, if you remember?

             9        A.   I believe it was Prince George's County

            10    Circuit Court.

            11        Q.   Were you testifying on behalf of the

            12    defendant or the plaintiff?

            13        A.   Plaintiff.

            14        Q.   What kind of case was it, if you

            15    remember?

            16        A.   It was -- I think it was a car accident

            17    case.

            18        Q.   Did you testify strictly as an expert

            19    or as a treating physician?

            20        A.   I don't remember.

            21        Q.   Okay, Doctor.  What, if anything, did

            22    you do to prepare for your deposition today?



                                                                 19





             1        A.   I reviewed this pile of medical

             2    records, went through it a couple of times.  I

             3    did that yesterday.  And then when I was waiting

             4    for you guys to come, I kind of looked over

             5    things again and read my reports again and

             6    glanced through the records.

             7        Q.   Great.  Did you speak with Plaintiff's

             8    counsel, Mr. Kolker, who is here with us today

             9    about your deposition before today?

            10        A.   I did speak to him.

            11        Q.   When was that?

            12        A.   Yesterday.

            13        Q.   And what did you talk about?

            14        A.   My opinions in this case.

            15        Q.   And what about your opinions did you

            16    discuss?

            17        A.   What's in my report really.

            18        Q.   Okay.  Did you speak with anyone else

            19    in preparation for your deposition today?

            20        A.   No.

            21        Q.   Have you reviewed any discovery in this

            22    case?



                                                                 20





             1        A.   I don't think so.

             2        Q.   Okay.  Have you been provided with

             3    Ms. Vaughn's deposition transcript?

             4        A.   So to be honest with you, I can't tell

             5    you if it's in here somewhere.  But if it is, I

             6    wouldn't have paid too much attention to it.  I

             7    didn't read it if it's there.

             8        Q.   Okay.

             9        A.   I don't think I have it.

            10        Q.   I don't think you have it either if my

            11    stack is the same as yours.

            12             Now, your records of Ms. Vaughn include

            13    other treating providers' records, correct?

            14        A.   Yes.

            15        Q.   And where did you get those records?

            16        A.   They would have been sent by

            17    Mr. Kolker.

            18        Q.   Now, there are two, I believe,

            19    transmittal letters from Mr. Kolker to you

            20    referencing the records that he has sent you.

            21    If we were to look back at those transmittal

            22    letters, would the dates be correct as to when



                                                                 21





             1    you received those records?

             2        A.   I don't know.  I don't know when we

             3    received them.  I mean, I would assume we

             4    received them shortly after the dates on the

             5    letters.

             6        Q.   Right.  Okay.  So you've had them some

             7    time.

             8        A.   Yeah, I think so.

             9        Q.   Okay.  Now, in addition to the records

            10    themselves, what I'm going to refer to as

            11    records, which would be records of the actual

            12    treatment and the doctors' notes and things like

            13    that, did you also review any medical bills or

            14    charges?

            15        A.   Not that I remember.

            16        Q.   Okay.  Have you spoken to any of

            17    Ms. Vaughn's other doctors or treatment

            18    providers?

            19        A.   No.

            20        Q.   Do you have any handwritten notes about

            21    this case?

            22        A.   Yes.



                                                                 22





             1        Q.   Are they included in --

             2        A.   They should be, yes.

             3        Q.   Do you recall when you were first

             4    contacted about this particular case?

             5        A.   No.  I guess it would have been around

             6    the time that that letter arrived.

             7        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember how you were

             8    first contacted, whether it was by letter or by

             9    phone?

            10        A.   I think it was by letter.

            11        Q.   Okay.  Have you been asked to come to

            12    trial in this case?

            13        A.   Not that I know of.

            14             (Deposition Exhibit Number 3 was marked

            15    for identification.)

            16             BY MS. KYLIS:

            17        Q.   Doctor, I will show you what I'm going

            18    to mark now as Deposition Exhibit 3.  This is

            19    your -- or this is the Plaintiff's Expert

            20    Witness Statement, and you will see your name

            21    there on that first page.

            22        A.   Okay.



                                                                 23





             1        Q.   Have you seen this before?

             2        A.   No.

             3        Q.   Have you spoken to Mr. Kolker about

             4    this expert witness statement?

             5        A.   Not that I recall.

             6        Q.   Do you know if you provided any input

             7    in any way in drafting that statement?

             8        A.   I don't remember talking about it.

             9    Perhaps it came from my report, but I didn't

            10    talk about it.

            11        Q.   Okay.  Are you keeping them all over

            12    there?

            13        A.   That's what I was doing.

            14        Q.   Okay.  Moving on, I would like to

            15    direct your attention to your evaluation of

            16    Ms. Vaughn on March 19th of 2019, earlier this

            17    year.

            18        A.   Okay.

            19        Q.   I see you have your report.  That's

            20    fantastic.  I'm also going to mark a copy of

            21    that report as Deposition Exhibit 4 for when I

            22    need it.



                                                                 24





             1             (Deposition Exhibit Number 4 was marked

             2    for identification.)

             3             BY MS. KYLIS:

             4        Q.   Now, Doctor, on March 19, 2019, in what

             5    capacity did you treat Ms. Vaughn?

             6        A.   I didn't treat her.  I evaluated her.

             7        Q.   What is the difference?  If you

             8    could --

             9        A.   Sure.  So this was an evaluation.

            10    Treatment is different.  Treatment we're all

            11    familiar with.  The patient goes into the

            12    doctor.  You have a problem.  You want to figure

            13    out what the problem is generally and you want

            14    to get it treated to feel better.

            15             An evaluation is a visit where the

            16    patient comes in generally sent by an interested

            17    party, an attorney, an insurance company, and

            18    you're not treating the patient trying to make

            19    them better, but you're evaluating them, talking

            20    to them in order to answer questions about a

            21    case typically or an injury.

            22        Q.   Okay.  So in performing an evaluation



                                                                 25





             1    where you're not treating the patient, how do

             2    you arrive at your evaluation?

             3        A.   Well, you review the records, talk to

             4    the patient, get a history, do a physical

             5    examination, review the imaging studies and then

             6    you using your experience, knowledge and the

             7    information that you've gleaned, you come up

             8    with an opinion.

             9        Q.   Great.  Now, do you have an independent

            10    recollection of the visit with Ms. Vaughn in

            11    March of 2019?

            12        A.   Not much.

            13        Q.   What do you remember, if anything?

            14        A.   I really -- I'm going to rely on my

            15    medical records for answering your questions.

            16        Q.   Oh, understood.  I was just wondering

            17    if there's -- if you remember anything about her

            18    in particular.

            19        A.   Not particularly.

            20        Q.   Okay.  Now, when you saw her on March

            21    19, 2019, the date of the accident that you were

            22    evaluating her for was June 11, 2015, correct?



                                                                 26





             1        A.   Yes.

             2        Q.   So in March of '19 you were almost four

             3    years post-accident, right?

             4        A.   Approaching that, yes.

             5        Q.   Yeah, not quite four years.  So before

             6    you saw her on March 19th, you received the

             7    records that we've talked about, correct?

             8        A.   Yes.

             9        Q.   And you reviewed those records before

            10    seeing her?

            11        A.   So I kind of glanced through them as I

            12    go in.  I don't usually review all the medical

            13    records before the patient comes in because

            14    sometimes they don't come in.  So I review them

            15    a bit as I'm getting ready to go see the

            16    patient, and then I go see the patient, I talk

            17    to the patient and I'm kind of glancing through

            18    the medical records as we talk and discuss the

            19    case.  And then afterwards, I make sure I

            20    thoroughly review all of the records.

            21        Q.   So at the time that you see the

            22    patient, do you get a history from the patient?



                                                                 27





             1        A.   Yes.

             2        Q.   And so during your evaluation, I know

             3    you're glancing at the records, but are you also

             4    relying on the patient's verbal history?

             5        A.   Very much so.

             6        Q.   Okay.  And when generally do you review

             7    records after having seen the patient?

             8        A.   As soon as I can after I see the

             9    patient.

            10        Q.   Okay.  Now, in this case before you --

            11    or when you saw Ms. Vaughn on March 19, 2019

            12    when you reviewed her records, do you recall

            13    reviewing records that predated her date of

            14    accident of June 11, 2015?

            15        A.   Yes.

            16        Q.   Okay.  So at the time that you saw her

            17    or when you reviewed those records, you were

            18    aware that she was already undergoing physical

            19    therapy treatments?

            20        A.   I was aware that she had a previous

            21    injury that had been treated and was in the

            22    course of being treated.



                                                                 28





             1        Q.   Okay.  And when you say in the course

             2    of being treated, is it fair for me to

             3    characterize that as ongoing?

             4        A.   I think that's fair.

             5        Q.   Okay.  Now, when you reviewed those

             6    records, did you pay any attention to her

             7    complaints of pain in particular?  And forgive

             8    me, I didn't word that terribly well.  When you

             9    were reviewing the records that predated her

            10    June 11, 2015 incident, did you pay any

            11    particular attention to her pain ratings that

            12    she had provided to her doctors based on their

            13    notes?

            14        A.   I mean, I read the notes.  I tried to

            15    take everything into account.  I don't remember

            16    specifically what her pain number ratings were.

            17        Q.   But is that something that you would

            18    pay attention to when you're reviewing them?

            19        A.   I mean, I try to pay attention to

            20    everything that's pertinent, and I think that's

            21    pertinent.

            22        Q.   Okay.  So based upon your review of



                                                                 29





             1    Ms. Vaughn's records that predated the June 11,

             2    2015 incident, are you familiar with her prior

             3    diagnoses of chronic pain and previous surgeries

             4    and other medical procedures?

             5        A.   I am.

             6        Q.   Okay.  I'd like to just go through some

             7    of those with you quickly.

             8        A.   Okay.

             9        Q.   Now, you're familiar with her prior

            10    diagnosis of a musculoskeletal disorder, right?

            11        A.   What do you mean by a musculoskeletal

            12    disorder?  That's kind of a big,

            13    all-encompassing term.

            14        Q.   I was hoping to ask you to explain that

            15    one to me.

            16        A.   Well, you'll have to show me where it

            17    was and I'll try to.

            18        Q.   I don't know that I can.

            19        A.   Because that can mean a lot of

            20    different things.

            21        Q.   Okay.  Well, what can it mean?

            22        A.   I would say it could mean almost any



                                                                 30





             1    orthopedic problem.  I mean, a musculoskeletal

             2    disorder is pretty nonspecific.

             3        Q.   Okay.  Well, let me back up.  Based on

             4    your review of Ms. Vaughn's records that predate

             5    the incident, you are aware that she was

             6    experiencing what I'd like to call as chronic

             7    pain issues?

             8        A.   That's true.

             9        Q.   And those chronic pain issues that she

            10    was experiencing prior to June 11, 2015 were

            11    pretty much throughout her body, correct?

            12        A.   So it looked to me like in the period

            13    of time most immediately before this injury, her

            14    complaints were largely related to neck,

            15    shoulder, upper back sort of areas.  Now, she

            16    told me that she did have problems with her low

            17    back that she was still having.  So I know that

            18    that's true, but she told me that they became

            19    dramatically worse after this injury.

            20             So although the notes don't really

            21    reflect a lot of treatment directed specifically

            22    at her low back, I know she was having some pain



                                                                 31





             1    in the low back because she told me that.

             2        Q.   Okay.  Are you familiar with her

             3    prior -- with her diagnosis of like spinal

             4    stenosis or facet disease, and please correct me

             5    if I'm conflating diagnoses, that predated the

             6    June 11, 2015 incident?

             7        A.   Well, she definitely had some

             8    degenerative changes in her low back that

             9    predated this injury, and the things you're

            10    mentioning are degenerative.

            11        Q.   Okay.  So spinal stenosis and facet

            12    disease, are they one and the same or are those

            13    two different?

            14        A.   So interesting.  So stenosis refers to

            15    a narrowing of the space available for either

            16    the cord, the spinal canal or the nerve roots.

            17    Okay.  And facet joint disease can help to

            18    produce that stenosis.  So stenosis is just the

            19    narrowing and that can be contributed to by many

            20    things, including facet degenerative changes.

            21        Q.   Thank you.  I will use the correct

            22    pronunciation.



                                                                 32





             1             Now, along with those diagnoses, are

             2    you familiar with her prior complaints of

             3    diagnosis of neuropathy related thereto?

             4        A.   She didn't tell me specifically about

             5    neuropathy, but I knew that she had radiating

             6    complaints previously, especially from the neck

             7    and into the shoulder area.  I don't know that I

             8    remember specifically seeing neuropathy.

             9        Q.   Okay.  Now, based upon your review of

            10    the records and, of course, your visit with her

            11    on March 19th, is it fair to say that she had a

            12    diagnosis of chronic neck pain prior to the June

            13    11, 2015 incident?

            14        A.   Well, I wasn't really evaluating her

            15    neck specifically, but I think that's fair to

            16    say.

            17        Q.   Okay.  How about chronic low back pain,

            18    is it fair to say that based upon your review of

            19    the records and your evaluation of her that she

            20    had a prior diagnosis of chronic low back pain

            21    prior to the June 11, 2015 incident?

            22        A.   I think that's fair to say, too.



                                                                 33





             1        Q.   Okay.  Now, how about chronic hip pain,

             2    based upon your review of the records and your

             3    evaluation of her, is it fair to say that she

             4    had chronic hip pain prior to the June 11, 2015

             5    incident?

             6        A.   No.  I will tell you that I didn't

             7    focus on hips or many other different body

             8    parts.  I don't remember seeing that.  That's

             9    possible I guess.

            10        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember seeing that she

            11    had had trigger point injections that I believe

            12    were directed at that lower extremity pain?

            13        A.   Was that by Dr. Barletta?

            14        Q.   I believe so.

            15        A.   I think I remember seeing some trigger

            16    point injections.  I'm not sure I can tell you

            17    where they were given.

            18        Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned earlier that

            19    Ms. Vaughn definitely had some degenerative

            20    conditions.  Based upon your review of the -- or

            21    the degenerative changes, I'm sorry, was how you

            22    phrased it.  Based upon your review of the



                                                                 34





             1    records and your evaluation of her, is it fair

             2    to say that she had I think what we generally

             3    refer to as degenerative disc disease diagnosed

             4    prior to the June 11, 2015 incident?

             5        A.   Yeah, I think that's right.

             6        Q.   Okay.  Now, she had also -- if I could

             7    just briefly focus on cervical spine issues that

             8    she had.  I know your report is mostly focused

             9    on her low back, but she had prior issues and

            10    complaints regarding her cervical spine before

            11    the June 11, 2015 incident, correct?

            12        A.   That's true.

            13        Q.   Great.  And those issues included --

            14    I'm going to butcher the pronunciation, but

            15    radiculopathy?

            16        A.   That was not bad.  Yeah, I believe she

            17    had some radicular complaints.

            18        Q.   And did she also have cervical disc

            19    displacement?

            20        A.   She definitely had I believe some

            21    cervical degenerative changes.

            22        Q.   Okay.  What about a cervical disc



                                                                 35





             1    bulge?

             2        A.   I can look.  She -- yes.  She had mild

             3    to moderate cervical spondylosis, which is

             4    degenerative change, and some disc osteophyte

             5    complexes, which is more degenerative change,

             6    and specifically degenerative disc disease.

             7        Q.   Thank you.  And she also had a prior

             8    diagnosis of polyarthritis I believe.  Do you

             9    recall that?

            10        A.   I do know that she had some arthritis.

            11        Q.   If I see the word polyarthritis, what

            12    does that mean?

            13        A.   That usually means in more than one

            14    joint.

            15        Q.   Perfect.  Okay.  Now, based upon your

            16    review of the records and your evaluation and

            17    your visit with her on March 19, 2019, are you

            18    familiar with her prior need and treatment with

            19    pain management?

            20        A.   I saw some of those records.

            21        Q.   Are you familiar with how long she has

            22    been -- had been in pain management when you saw



                                                                 36





             1    her?

             2        A.   I don't remember.

             3        Q.   Okay.  If I told you that she testified

             4    that it had been about two decades, does that

             5    sound about right?

             6        A.   That could very well be.

             7        Q.   Okay.  And are you familiar with the

             8    fact that she has testified that she was taking

             9    pain medications as of the June 11, 2015 date?

            10        A.   No, but it wouldn't be surprising to

            11    me.

            12        Q.   Would that knowledge change your

            13    opinion in any way?

            14        A.   I don't think so.

            15        Q.   Now, Doctor, what is your understanding

            16    of the mechanism of injury alleged in this case?

            17        A.   So she described it to me as slipping

            18    on a wet floor with one -- and I asked her if

            19    she fell.  She said she didn't fall.  So one leg

            20    she said kind of slipped out in front of her and

            21    she ended up sort of extending her back, I guess

            22    to try to keep her balance.



                                                                 37





             1        Q.   Did she tell you, if you remember, how

             2    far apart her feet were during this slip event?

             3        A.   If she did, I don't see it in my notes.

             4        Q.   Okay.  If she testified in her

             5    deposition that her front foot slipped out about

             6    two to three feet from the back foot, does that

             7    sound familiar?

             8        A.   She told me the leg went out in front,

             9    but I don't think I asked her how far.

            10        Q.   Okay.  Does it matter how far apart her

            11    feet separated when she slipped to your review

            12    and analysis?

            13        A.   I mean, if she slipped a foot and a

            14    half or two feet, I don't know that that makes a

            15    difference.

            16        Q.   Why not?

            17        A.   Because what I'm looking at is the

            18    mechanism of injury that's consistent with

            19    something that can cause this type of problem,

            20    and I thought her explanation of the episode

            21    sounded like something that could cause a

            22    problem in her back the way she was describing



                                                                 38





             1    it to me.

             2        Q.   Would you explain that to me?

             3        A.   What do you mean?

             4        Q.   What about her explanation made you --

             5    or is the basis for your opinion that the

             6    mechanism of injury was consistent with her

             7    injuries as alleged?

             8        A.   Well, when she described it to me, I

             9    mean, I can think of times myself when I slipped

            10    and I kind of jerked my body to catch myself.

            11    We know she didn't have a completely normal

            12    lumbar spine before that and I thought that sort

            13    of quick jerking trying to save yourself

            14    movement when your leg slips out in front of you

            15    could certainly cause a low back problem.

            16        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

            17        A.   Sure.

            18        Q.   Now, Doctor, what is your understanding

            19    of her complaints based upon your review of the

            20    records and your evaluation of her immediately

            21    after the incident?

            22        A.   So what I saw from the Bowie Health



                                                                 39





             1    Center where she was seen on the day she got

             2    hurt is that she had complaints of pain in her

             3    right shoulder, right low back and right hip.

             4        Q.   Now, those complaints, is it fair to

             5    refer to them as subjective complaints?

             6        A.   Sure.  When the patient is making

             7    complaints about pain, that's subjective.

             8        Q.   When she was treated at Bowie Health

             9    right after the incident, there were no

            10    objective findings of injury?

            11        A.   Oh, I don't know.  I have to look at

            12    the reports.  I'm not sure if there were any

            13    objective findings or not, but those complaints

            14    are certainly subjective.  I can look if you

            15    want.

            16        Q.   If you have it handy.

            17        A.   I have it right in front of me.  I

            18    don't see any objective findings here.

            19        Q.   Thank you.

            20        A.   Sure.

            21        Q.   Now, you have reviewed Ms. Vaughn's

            22    diagnostic imaging as part of your review of her



                                                                 40





             1    records, correct?

             2        A.   I have.

             3        Q.   Now, I would direct you to -- and you

             4    note this in your report, on June 18, 2015, so

             5    about a week, exactly a week after the accident,

             6    she had an MRI of her thoracic and lumbar spine.

             7        A.   Yes.

             8        Q.   Now, based upon your review of that

             9    MRI, is it fair to say that the findings were

            10    degenerative changes?

            11        A.   I think that they were largely

            12    degenerative changes.  I didn't see any findings

            13    here that I would say were caused by this injury

            14    in particular.

            15        Q.   So, in other words, is it fair to say

            16    that there was no evidence of a traumatic injury

            17    in that MRI?

            18        A.   I couldn't point to anything in that

            19    MRI and say that that was traumatic.

            20        Q.   Okay.  And in the June 18, 2015 MRI,

            21    there was no -- I'm sorry, I just lost my

            22    place -- there was no indication of a bulging



                                                                 41





             1    disc or a herniated disc; is that right?

             2        A.   So, yeah, there was a bulging disc at

             3    L3-4 to the left into the foramen, and at L4-5

             4    there was a left foraminal disc protrusion with

             5    an annular tear.

             6        Q.   Where are you getting that?

             7        A.   Well, it's in my report right here.

             8        Q.   Oh, okay.  So if you could explain --

             9    we're about what, seven, eight lines down?

            10        A.   Yeah.  You see where it says was noted

            11    to reveal left neural foraminal HNP?  That's a

            12    disc herniation.

            13        Q.   Okay.  So a disc herniation at L4-5?

            14    No.

            15        A.   It was at L4-5, yes, and then there was

            16    a bulge at L3-4.

            17        Q.   Okay.  Now, Doctor, if I could direct

            18    your attention down a few more lines where

            19    you're talking about an MRI obtained on

            20    10/22/16, which was then compared to her prior

            21    scans.  It says that one revealed the interval

            22    development of disc herniation at L3-4.



                                                                 42





             1        A.   Yes.

             2        Q.   Is that different from the disc

             3    herniation you were just explaining to me with

             4    regard to the June 18, 2015 MRI?

             5        A.   Yes.

             6        Q.   How is that different?

             7        A.   It's a level above.  It's at the level

             8    where there was a disc bulge before.

             9        Q.   I'm sorry, could you say that again?

            10        A.   Sure.  So in the first MRI scan from

            11    6/18/15 at L3-4, there was -- the radiologist

            12    said moderate left foraminal narrowing due to a

            13    disc bulge.  So there was some bulging there,

            14    but not something that the radiologist called a

            15    frank disk herniation.

            16             When that scan that you were just

            17    talking about on 10/22/16 was done, they felt

            18    that there was actually -- the radiologist who

            19    read it felt that there had developed a disc

            20    herniation on the left side at L3-4, whereas the

            21    prior MRI scan had shown a bulge at that level.

            22        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.  So is it fair to



                                                                 43





             1    say that this problem starts out as a bulge and

             2    can, if it gets worse, become a herniation?

             3        A.   It can.

             4        Q.   That's the progression of the disease,

             5    the complaints or the -- I'm not sure what word

             6    I'm looking for here.  Please forgive me.

             7        A.   Let me help you.  So a disc bulge

             8    doesn't have to become a frank disc herniation.

             9    They don't always, but they can.  Like you just

            10    said, they can progress and it can become a

            11    herniation.

            12        Q.   Okay.  And based on the review of these

            13    MRIs, it looks like that's what happened to

            14    Ms. Vaughn?

            15        A.   I think so.

            16        Q.   Okay.  Now, how does a disc bulge

            17    become a herniation?

            18        A.   So through wear and tear, walking

            19    around, activities of daily living can put

            20    stress on the discs and that can cause the bulge

            21    to progress.

            22        Q.   Okay.  Now, about -- I'll take you just



                                                                 44





             1    a couple more lines down when you reviewed her

             2    updated MRI from July 21, 2017.

             3        A.   Okay.

             4        Q.   This time it looks from your report

             5    like it revealed very mild multilevel

             6    degenerative spondylosis?

             7        A.   Yes.

             8        Q.   Can you explain what that means in

             9    relation to what you saw on the prior two MRIs,

            10    how it's different, if it is?

            11        A.   So I'm not sure that it's actually very

            12    different.  So one of the things you have to be

            13    aware of is that different people can look at

            14    the same MRI scans and you can get different

            15    readings.  Okay.  It's an interpretation thing

            16    and not everyone interprets the findings on an

            17    MRI scan in exactly the same way.

            18             So it's hard sometimes to compare

            19    findings based on reports.  Sometimes it's

            20    easier.  Like this, we're talking about a disc

            21    herniation and before we were talking about a

            22    disc bulge.  I think that's significant.  But, I



                                                                 45





             1    mean, I think the bottom line is she definitely

             2    has some degenerative changes and she has,

             3    again, the left L3-4 disc herniation and

             4    protrusion and now they're describing it

             5    actually as an extrusion.

             6        Q.   And what is that?

             7        A.   So an extrusion is where the piece of

             8    disc actually breaks off from the main disc and

             9    it's extruded.  It's separate.

            10        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.  Now, the July 21,

            11    2017 MRI was right before she had her surgery

            12    with Dr. Schreiber on August 31, 2017, right?

            13        A.   Yes.

            14        Q.   So was that surgery to -- well, tell me

            15    what that surgery was for.

            16        A.   So in that surgery Dr. Schreiber

            17    addressed the two levels of concern, that being

            18    the L4-5 level and the L3-4 level, that we were

            19    just talking about.  So he decompressed

            20    basically the areas where it looked like there

            21    was some narrowing and compromise of the

            22    neurologic structures with that surgery.



                                                                 46





             1        Q.   Okay.  So did he repair the extrusion

             2    or is that unrelated?

             3        A.   He removed it.  That's what the

             4    discectomy is.

             5        Q.   I see.  So the discectomy is removing

             6    the one that had come out of place, what we call

             7    the extrusion.

             8        A.   Yes, it's removing the herniated disc.

             9        Q.   Understood.  And the laminectomy is

            10    creating space?

            11        A.   The laminectomy is removing the lamina,

            12    which is the bony part of the back of the spine.

            13    So to get down to this area, you have to take

            14    off some of the ligaments and then you have to

            15    either remove a part of the lamina, which is

            16    called the laminotomy, or you can remove the

            17    whole lamina if you need to get a really wide

            18    exposure, which is called the laminectomy, and

            19    just allows access to the area where you need to

            20    do your work.

            21        Q.   Okay.  And what work?

            22        A.   So he did -- he removed the L4 lamina.



                                                                 47





             1    He did foraminotomies at L5 on both sides, which

             2    means that he opened up the space in the neural

             3    foramina for the nerve roots.  He did L4

             4    foraminotomies and then he did the partial

             5    laminectomy at L3 and the discectomy where he

             6    removed the disc.

             7        Q.   Thank you.

             8        A.   Sure.

             9        Q.   All right, Doctor.  I'm going to skip a

            10    page and move to your evaluation of Ms. Vaughn

            11    on page 3 of your report.

            12        A.   Okay.

            13        Q.   If you could look at the bottom where I

            14    believe you have your opinions laid out.

            15        A.   Okay.

            16        Q.   You say in your report that it is your

            17    opinion that it is more likely than not that the

            18    slip on the wet floor in Walmart contributed to

            19    the need for the surgery that was subsequently

            20    performed.  Which surgery are you referring to

            21    in that statement in your report?

            22        A.   Well, I think she's only had one lumbar



                                                                 48





             1    surgery.

             2        Q.   So it is the lumbar surgery

             3    specifically.

             4        A.   Yes.

             5        Q.   Okay.  Now, you are aware that

             6    Ms. Vaughn also had shoulder surgery in the time

             7    between her accident at Walmart and the time

             8    that she saw you, correct?

             9        A.   I am.

            10        Q.   And that shoulder surgery is in no way

            11    related to the Walmart incident based upon your

            12    review of the records and your evaluation of

            13    her.

            14        A.   I don't think so.

            15        Q.   Okay.  Sorry, I got myself out of

            16    order.

            17        A.   No problem.

            18        Q.   Okay.  I skipped over what I wanted to

            19    ask you about the August 31, 2017 surgery.

            20        A.   Okay.

            21        Q.   So, first, that was two years after her

            22    incident at Walmart on June 11, 2015.



                                                                 49





             1        A.   That's true.

             2        Q.   And is it fair to say that it was --

             3    the purpose of that surgery was to treat the

             4    bulging disc and herniated disc that we talked

             5    about?

             6        A.   Well, it was to treat the anatomical

             7    problems that were causing her symptoms that she

             8    was having, but really the surgery is for the

             9    pain and symptoms and the problems that she's

            10    having.

            11        Q.   I see.  But the symptoms and the

            12    problems are caused by the bulging disc and

            13    herniation, or no?

            14        A.   So, yeah, I think that they were, but

            15    you have to understand that there's -- there are

            16    people who have changes that look like this that

            17    don't have any pain and they don't get surgery.

            18    So surgery is for the pain that's associated

            19    with these changes that we saw on the imaging

            20    studies.

            21        Q.   Okay.  And when you refer to them as

            22    changes, this is degenerative changes?



                                                                 50





             1        A.   Degenerative changes, disc herniations.

             2    You know, those all can be degenerative.

             3        Q.   Okay.  Now, based on your review of the

             4    records and your evaluation of Ms. Vaughn, she

             5    had the changes that this surgery was used to

             6    treat prior to the June 11, 2015 incident,

             7    correct?

             8        A.   Some of them.

             9        Q.   Okay.  What was new?

            10        A.   Well, that L3-4 disc herniation that we

            11    were just talking about and the extrusion

            12    developed after the injury.

            13        Q.   Are those kind of problems, can they be

            14    characterized as degenerative changes?

            15        A.   They're sometimes degenerative.

            16    They're sometimes traumatic.  As I told you, I

            17    wouldn't be able to call relation of these

            18    changes as traumatic, so -- I mean, they happen

            19    in different ways.

            20        Q.   Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.  I apologize

            21    for getting us off track there.  If I could go

            22    back to your opinion about the slip on the wet



                                                                 51





             1    floor contributing to the need for surgery.

             2    When you use the word contributed, is it fair to

             3    say that you would agree with me that the

             4    incident at Walmart is not the sole cause of her

             5    need for surgery in this case?

             6        A.   That's completely true.

             7        Q.   What other causes or contributing

             8    factors can you point to that are at play for

             9    Ms. Vaughn?

            10        A.   Besides the fall?  Or not the fall, but

            11    the slip thing.

            12        Q.   Right.

            13        A.   Yeah.  So I think her degenerative

            14    changes that preexisted this and the fact that

            15    she was having some symptoms before this point

            16    to the fact that this incident was not the only

            17    thing that contributed to her back problems,

            18    which ultimately required surgical treatment.

            19        Q.   Based upon your review of her records

            20    and talking with her in your visit, are you able

            21    to apportion in any way by percentages or any

            22    other means how much the Walmart incident is a



                                                                 52





             1    cause for her needing the surgery as compared to

             2    the other contributing factors that you just

             3    described?

             4             MR. KOLKER:  Objection.

             5             You can answer.

             6             THE WITNESS:  So that's a good

             7    question, and the answer really honestly is I

             8    didn't think of apportioning it and I didn't

             9    really think about that.  I mean, I'd be making

            10    up a number, which I don't want to do.  I think

            11    part of it was -- I think it was contributed to

            12    by the injury because she told me things got so

            13    much worse after the injury, but clearly it

            14    wasn't, you know, a perfectly normal back before

            15    that.  So, I mean, there's a contribution of

            16    both and I can't tell you exactly what the

            17    percentages are of each.

            18             BY MS. KYLIS:

            19        Q.   Based on your review of the records and

            20    these prior conditions that she was already

            21    complaining of, do you think it's more likely

            22    than not that she would have had the back



                                                                 53





             1    surgery anyway?

             2        A.   I don't know that I could say that

             3    because there are a lot of people running around

             4    with a lot of degenerative changes and findings

             5    who live with them, and sometimes they're

             6    asymptomatic, sometimes they're minimally

             7    symptomatic, but they for sure don't all end up

             8    with surgery.

             9        Q.   But it's true that Ms. Vaughn was not

            10    asymptomatic before the incident.

            11        A.   That's true.

            12        Q.   Okay.  All right.  Now, it looks like

            13    the second part of your opinion here in your

            14    report, if I could point to the last sentence on

            15    this page 3, is that the patient has sustained a

            16    permanent impairment, a portion of which also

            17    has been contributed to by a slip at Walmart.

            18    Am I reading that mostly right?

            19        A.   I think so.

            20        Q.   Now, when you talk about a permanent

            21    impairment, can you tell me what you mean by

            22    that?



                                                                 54





             1        A.   Sure.  So an impairment is a term that

             2    we use to refer to a body part system, body

             3    function that's not working normally as it

             4    should.  The person is not a hundred percent, in

             5    this case with regard to her low back.  And then

             6    there's a related concept of disability, which

             7    is not really the medical determination which

             8    refers to how an impairment affects a person's

             9    life, activities of daily living, the ability to

            10    earn a living, you know, things like that.

            11        Q.   Did you do a disability -- what's the

            12    word for that?

            13        A.   Evaluation?

            14        Q.   Yeah.  Disability rating in this case?

            15        A.   No.  I don't do disability ratings.

            16        Q.   Why not?

            17        A.   Because, again, so impairment is the

            18    medical thing that we look at and disability is

            19    a judgment that someone else makes about what

            20    effects they have.  That's not really a medical

            21    judgment.

            22        Q.   Understood.  Thank you, Doctor.  So



                                                                 55





             1    where you state in your report here that it's a

             2    portion of the permanent impairment is

             3    contributed to by the accident at Walmart, can

             4    you quantify portion in any way based on the way

             5    you've characterized the permanent impairment in

             6    this case?

             7        A.   My answer would be the same as it was

             8    for the need for the surgery.  So, you know, you

             9    take her as she is today and she certainly has

            10    an impairment, and I think part of it was

            11    contributed to by this slip and part of it was

            12    contributed to by what she had before, and I

            13    haven't thought about or tried to give an

            14    estimation of percentage contributions from each

            15    of those.

            16        Q.   Understood.  Since you've called it a

            17    portion, I'm guessing your answer is going to be

            18    the same as last time, but are the other

            19    contributing factors that would round out the

            20    rest of the pie that leads you to opine that she

            21    has a permanent impairment?

            22        A.   Sure.  So, again, yeah, you're right,



                                                                 56





             1    it would be the same.  So her preexisting

             2    degenerative changes, you know, she had some

             3    prior problems with her back.  Those would be

             4    the other things that go into the impairment

             5    that she has.

             6        Q.   Now, based on your review of the

             7    records that predate her injury, we've already

             8    discussed that she had these diagnoses of prior

             9    chronic pain, she had many, many complaints of

            10    pain and back issues and issues in other areas

            11    of the body.  Based on your review of those

            12    records, is it -- would it be fair to say that

            13    she had this impairment before the incident at

            14    Walmart?

            15        A.   Well, I don't think she had the same

            16    impairment before this incident that she has

            17    now.  She's had surgery.  She's had alteration

            18    in her anatomy.  Things are different now than

            19    they were before.

            20        Q.   Okay.  Now, did the surgery -- was the

            21    surgery successful?

            22        A.   She told me that she had some



                                                                 57





             1    improvement from it, but not complete, so I

             2    think it helped some she said.

             3        Q.   Okay.  And your evaluation of that is

             4    simply based on her subjective history to you?

             5        A.   Completely.

             6        Q.   Okay.  There are no diagnostic imagings

             7    that you've reviewed to compare before the

             8    surgery to after the surgery.

             9        A.   So are you asking me if her imaging

            10    studies improved from before to after surgery?

            11        Q.   Yes.

            12        A.   I don't know.

            13        Q.   Okay.  Now, it's true -- so, Doctor,

            14    did you see Ms. Vaughn before March 19, 2019?

            15        A.   I did.

            16        Q.   Yes.  When did you see her?

            17        A.   I had seen her before on February 16,

            18    2018.

            19        Q.   And what was that visit for?

            20        A.   That was another evaluation.

            21        Q.   And that was in 2018, February 2018, so

            22    2.5ish years after the June 11, 2015 incident?



                                                                 58





             1        A.   Yes.

             2        Q.   Okay.  And what was Ms. Vaughn seeing

             3    you for on March 19, 2019?

             4        A.   She was complaining about her right

             5    shoulder and low back.

             6        Q.   Was there a particular incident that

             7    was the root of that visit?

             8        A.   She was talking to me about an injury

             9    that had occurred on July 20, 2014 in a Rose's

            10    store when she sat down in a chair that fell

            11    apart causing her to fall.

            12        Q.   Do you recall the circumstances of that

            13    fall?  And what I'm getting at is like how she

            14    fell, onto what area of her body she fell?

            15        A.   I don't know.

            16        Q.   Okay.  Now, when she came to see you on

            17    February 16, 2018 for that evaluation, she was

            18    also complaining about low back pain, correct?

            19        A.   She was.

            20        Q.   Okay.  Sorry, Doctor, just one --

            21        A.   No problem.

            22        Q.   Oh, did I ever -- I did give this.  I



                                                                 59





             1    may not have.  Forgive me, Doctor.  Very, very

             2    briefly, I'm showing you what's been marked as

             3    Exhibit 4.  Is that your March 19, 2019 report?

             4        A.   It is.

             5        Q.   Great.  Thank you.

             6        A.   Sure.

             7             (Deposition Exhibit Number 5 was marked

             8    for identification.)

             9             BY MS. KYLIS:

            10        Q.   Doctor, I'm showing you Deposition

            11    Exhibit Number 5.  Is that your report from your

            12    evaluation of Ms. Vaughn on February 16, 2018?

            13        A.   Yes.

            14        Q.   Thank you.  Now, in -- I think I was

            15    just asking you before I realized my little

            16    mistake there that one of her complaints that

            17    you detail in your report as the chief complaint

            18    is the low back; is that right?

            19        A.   True.

            20        Q.   Okay.  And so during that evaluation,

            21    did you -- in addition to focusing on the

            22    shoulder, which I know you've mentioned, did you



                                                                 60





             1    also focus on the low back?

             2        A.   I did.

             3        Q.   Okay.  And what was your evaluation of

             4    her low back pain as of that visit, if you

             5    recall?

             6        A.   Do you mean my conclusions?

             7        Q.   Well, so, yes, yes, I do, but it seemed

             8    to me that you didn't really make any opinions

             9    in here about the low back, so I was hoping you

            10    could tell me what conclusions you did find

            11    about the low back in this report.

            12        A.   Well, I said I was unable to causally

            13    relate her ongoing back pain or the need for her

            14    low back surgery to this injury from 7/20/14.

            15        Q.   Do you remember why that was?

            16        A.   Yeah.  I mean, she commented on and

            17    complained of some low back pain initially for,

            18    I thought, a relatively short period of time and

            19    then there's not much mention of it, and so

            20    there was a pretty long time when she wasn't

            21    complaining about it and then it came up again

            22    after this other injury that we're talking



                                                                 61





             1    about.

             2        Q.   Okay.  Now, when you saw her on

             3    February 16, 2018, you had her medical records

             4    beforehand or at the time of your evaluation to

             5    review, correct?

             6        A.   Yes.

             7        Q.   And I think we already went through

             8    just a couple of times that she -- well, you

             9    agreed with me earlier that she had been

            10    complaining about low back pain earlier in 2015,

            11    right?

            12        A.   I believe so.

            13        Q.   Okay.  So that was after the July 20,

            14    2014 incident at Rose's, but before the Walmart

            15    incident, correct?

            16        A.   Yeah.  You know, I'm not sure if it was

            17    2015 or two-thousand -- most of them with regard

            18    to her neck were in 2014 I believe.

            19        Q.   Okay.  Well, if her records did show

            20    that she was complaining of pain in her low back

            21    in early 2015, so after the incident at Rose's

            22    but before Walmart, would that change your



                                                                 62





             1    opinion as to whether the low back pain at that

             2    time was causally related to the incident at

             3    Rose's?

             4        A.   I don't think so because I already knew

             5    she had a long history of ongoing back pain.

             6        Q.   Before the incident at Rose's?

             7        A.   Before the incident at Rose's, I think

             8    you told me she had had pain in her back for 20

             9    years.

            10        Q.   I think it was pain management for 20

            11    years, but, yes, I think that's fair to say.

            12        A.   I mean, she told me she had, you know,

            13    a long history with regard to her back.

            14        Q.   Okay.  And when you saw her in February

            15    of 2018, were you also aware of the Walmart

            16    incident that she's complaining about?

            17        A.   Yes.  I don't know that I knew it was

            18    in Walmart, but I had talked about the episode

            19    that she had.

            20        Q.   Okay.  Did that factor into your

            21    evaluation of her based on the low back

            22    complaints that she was still treating for when



                                                                 63





             1    you saw her in 2018?

             2        A.   I think so.

             3        Q.   How did that factor in?

             4        A.   Well, it seemed like a much more

             5    reasonable explanation for her ongoing low back

             6    pain than the fall in Rose's.

             7        Q.   But the fall in Rose's, she was seated

             8    in a chair, correct?

             9        A.   Yes.

            10        Q.   And fell down striking the floor,

            11    correct?

            12        A.   She fell back, yeah, from the chair

            13    that broke she said.

            14        Q.   Okay.  So if she fell backwards,

            15    inevitably she landed on her back and/or

            16    shoulder, correct?

            17        A.   I mean, I don't know what she landed

            18    on.

            19        Q.   Right.  But if she fell backwards,

            20    there's -- I mean, the law of physics means that

            21    she had to have fallen onto her backside in some

            22    way, correct?



                                                                 64





             1        A.   Maybe.  I don't know how she fell.

             2    Sometimes people fall forwards.  I don't know

             3    how she fell.

             4        Q.   Okay.  Well, either way she did make --

             5    she fell onto the floor, so she made impact with

             6    the floor.

             7        A.   I believe so.

             8        Q.   Okay.  And why is it your opinion, if

             9    it is your opinion, that falling and landing on

            10    the floor is not as consistent with the low back

            11    pain as a slip in which you do not fall?

            12        A.   Well, it is consistent with low back

            13    pain and she had low back pain, and then it

            14    was -- she was treated, but her treatment notes

            15    reflect treatment in the vast predominance for

            16    her neck and shoulder.  And if you look at the

            17    notes from the Multi-Specialty, they're really

            18    talking about her cervical/thoracic spine,

            19    neck/upper back and they're really not talking

            20    about her low back.

            21        Q.   Okay.  Now, looking back at the

            22    records -- well, I'm sorry, let me start that



                                                                 65





             1    one again.  You reviewed records obviously after

             2    her incident at Walmart, too, correct?

             3        A.   Yes.

             4        Q.   And that included a lot of physical

             5    therapy treatment records, correct?

             6        A.   Yes.

             7        Q.   And in those records, if I may

             8    characterize the bulk of them, reference

             9    treatments to both her shoulder, which I believe

            10    in your report that we've marked as Exhibit 5,

            11    you causally relate to the incident at Rose's

            12    and her low back pain.  Isn't that -- is that

            13    right, is that fair to say?

            14        A.   There's a lot of notes that reflect

            15    treatment to both, yes.

            16        Q.   And so based on your two reports, if I

            17    could combine them for just a second, it seems

            18    to me that your opinion -- and tell me if I'm

            19    wrong, your opinion is that her shoulder issues

            20    are all attributable to the incident at Rose's,

            21    and the low back is attributable to -- with the

            22    exception of the underlying chronic pain that



                                                                 66





             1    she had before, attributable to the Walmart

             2    incident.  Is that fair to say?

             3        A.   Well, the shoulder I also think was

             4    related to some preexisting problems.  But of

             5    these injuries we're talking about, I would

             6    relate that to the one from 2014.  And the

             7    ongoing low back issues, I would relate to the

             8    incident at Walmart.

             9        Q.   Understood.  So given that and given

            10    that her physical therapy treatments were for

            11    both of those body parts, do you have an opinion

            12    as to how -- well, let me start that over.  Is

            13    there a way for you to parse out what of that

            14    treatment is related to the Walmart incident

            15    versus the incident at Rose's or her underlying

            16    degenerative conditions?

            17        A.   Well, I would say that the treatment to

            18    the low back, I would relate to the Walmart

            19    incident and the treatment to her shoulder I

            20    would relate to the Rose's problem.

            21        Q.   And is there -- can you tell me how you

            22    would apportion that, if you could, based on



                                                                 67





             1    your review of the records?

             2        A.   I don't really know how I would

             3    apportion it beyond saying that a portion of it

             4    is related to this other injury and a portion of

             5    it is related to this Walmart problem.

             6        Q.   Is there any way for you to quantify

             7    that, like 50/50, 30/70?

             8        A.   I mean, I suppose it would depend on

             9    how much time, effort and service was done to

            10    each of those body parts in each individual

            11    therapy session, which probably would be pretty

            12    hard to figure out.

            13        Q.   Okay.  I haven't been able to figure it

            14    out, so.  But I am not nearly as smart as you

            15    are, Doctor, so --

            16        A.   I'm not sure about that.

            17             MR. KOLKER:  Don't sell yourself short.

            18             BY MS. KYLIS:

            19        Q.   All right.  Let me get myself back on

            20    track here.  Okay.  So we've talked about your

            21    visits with Ms. Vaughn on March 19, 2019 and

            22    February 16, 2018.  Do you recall any other



                                                                 68





             1    visits with Ms. Vaughn for any reason?

             2        A.   So, again, I'm relying on my records.

             3    I don't see any other visits in my notes.

             4        Q.   Okay.  Have you spoken with Ms. Vaughn

             5    since March 2019?

             6        A.   Not that I recall.

             7             (Deposition Exhibit Number 6 was marked

             8    for identification.)

             9             BY MS. KYLIS:

            10        Q.   Okay, Doctor.  Let me mark as

            11    Deposition Exhibit 6 this -- I'll represent to

            12    you this is the report authored by Dr. -- I

            13    think it's Mark Rosenthal, I should know that,

            14    Mark Rosenthal about Ms. Vaughn in this case.

            15    Have you seen that before?

            16        A.   No.

            17        Q.   Would you like to take just a moment to

            18    read it?

            19        A.   Okay.

            20        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

            21        A.   Sure.  Okay.

            22        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.  Now, do you know



                                                                 69





             1    Dr. Rosenthal, either personally or

             2    professionally?

             3        A.   I mean, I've seen his name on reports

             4    before.  I don't know him.

             5        Q.   Never met him?

             6        A.   I don't think so.

             7        Q.   Okay.  Now, as you just read,

             8    Dr. Rosenthal has done a records review in this

             9    case and has provided his opinions in this

            10    report, and one of those opinions is that her

            11    complaints and physical findings are the same

            12    after the event as they were before the event,

            13    and that's based on his review of the records

            14    that he puts forth in his report.  Do you agree

            15    with that assessment?

            16        A.   No.

            17        Q.   Why not?

            18        A.   Because of what she told me about her

            19    pain and how she reacted and how her pain

            20    changed after the injury.

            21        Q.   And can you describe that for me,

            22    please, like what about it.



                                                                 70





             1        A.   Sure.  She told me that her pain was

             2    dramatically increased by this slip and that it

             3    remained at a significantly elevated level

             4    throughout her treatment.

             5        Q.   Okay.  So is it fair to say that your

             6    assessment on that point is simply based on her

             7    subjective complaints as opposed to any specific

             8    findings in the records?

             9        A.   Sure.  I mean, it's based on her

            10    history that she gave me and I'm taking her at

            11    her word.  If her history was different, I could

            12    have a completely different conclusion.

            13        Q.   Understood.  What I'm going to refer to

            14    as the second part here of Dr. Rosenthal's

            15    opinions is that she had a new onset of

            16    symptoms -- this is in the third paragraph from

            17    the bottom -- in 2017 and that's what led to the

            18    surgery that she had in 2018.  Do you agree with

            19    that assessment?

            20        A.   So let me just point out something that

            21    I noticed which is that, you know,

            22    Dr. Rosenthal doesn't appear to have had all the



                                                                 71





             1    medical records when he did this review.  He

             2    says she does eventually have an MRI of the

             3    lumbar spine July 21, 2017.

             4             There were two MRI scans before that he

             5    doesn't seem to be aware of having been done,

             6    and I don't know that that might not have

             7    changed some of his conclusions.  I don't know

             8    because I'm not him, but to know that there was

             9    an MRI done, you know, in the neighborhood of a

            10    week or so after this injury and that there was

            11    another MRI done in 2016 and that this MRI that

            12    he's talking about was far from the first MRI of

            13    her low back since this incident occurred, so

            14    the bottom line is I disagree.

            15        Q.   Okay.  Well, since you mentioned the

            16    prior MRIs, it is true, isn't it, that those

            17    MRIs showed different levels, I think is how you

            18    characterized of problems in her spine, correct?

            19        A.   Well, they showed different degrees of

            20    problems at a couple of different levels of her

            21    spine.

            22        Q.   Okay.  And so if -- is it fair for me



                                                                 72





             1    to say that the degree of problem in 2017 was

             2    worse than in 2015?

             3        A.   Yes.

             4        Q.   Okay.  So then is it also fair to say

             5    that if it's worse two years later, it could be

             6    characterized as a new onset of symptoms?

             7        A.   No.  To me worse is not new.  Worse is

             8    an increasing level of symptoms.

             9        Q.   Okay.  And explain to me why it would

            10    get worse.

            11        A.   Well, if her changes in her lumbar

            12    spine got worse, she had a disc extrusion --

            13    well, she had a protrusion, then she had an

            14    extrusion.  That certainly is consistent I think

            15    with a worsening.

            16        Q.   And what generally causes that, those

            17    worsening stages this quick?

            18        A.   The worsening of -- I'm not sure what

            19    you mean.  The worsening of symptoms, the

            20    worsening of the MRI findings?

            21        Q.   The changes that I believe we see on

            22    the MRI.



                                                                 73





             1        A.   So I think we talked about that.

             2    That's -- you know, you can have changes like

             3    that if there's a problem with the disc,

             4    degenerative or injury to a disc, with time,

             5    with wear and tear.  Although it doesn't always

             6    happen, that can progress, can worsen and can

             7    develop into a herniation.

             8        Q.   Understood.  So if we see a progression

             9    here in her MRI findings that you've reviewed

            10    from the 2015, 2016, 2017, that progression is

            11    it fair to say that that is related to the

            12    degenerative wear and tear kind of life changes

            13    as opposed to a traumatic injury?

            14        A.   It could be, and this is where you have

            15    to go to the history, talk to the patient about

            16    how she was doing, what sorts of changes she

            17    experienced in her symptoms relative to the

            18    timing of these injuries.

            19        Q.   Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.  Let me just

            20    run through your opinions real quick and then I

            21    think we'll be all set here.

            22        A.   Okay.



                                                                 74





             1        Q.   So if you are subpoenaed to appear at

             2    trial, will you be offering an opinion to a

             3    reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

             4    what caused Ms. Vaughn's alleged injuries?

             5        A.   I think so.

             6        Q.   And what is that opinion?

             7        A.   It's the opinion that she had an

             8    underlying degenerative condition and that this

             9    fall aggravated that condition and contributed

            10    to her ultimate need for surgery.

            11        Q.   And what is the foundation for that

            12    opinion?

            13        A.   I mean, I think that's what we've been

            14    talking about the whole time.  The foundation is

            15    the fact that she had some preexisting problems

            16    and some preexisting pain and some preexisting

            17    changes on MRI scans, and she had this slip in

            18    the Walmart and developed significantly

            19    increased pain at that time.

            20        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.  Now, if subpoenaed

            21    to appear at trial, do you intend to offer any

            22    opinions to a reasonable degree of medical



                                                                 75





             1    certainty or probability as to her damages?

             2        A.   What do you mean?

             3        Q.   Well, you told me earlier you hadn't

             4    reviewed any medical bills.  Do you intend to

             5    offer any opinions related thereto?

             6        A.   I mean, I could have opinions if I

             7    reviewed the medical records and bills, but I

             8    don't think -- I haven't so far.

             9        Q.   Okay.  Do you intend to offer any

            10    opinion if subpoenaed to appear at trial as to

            11    Ms. Vaughn's pain and suffering?

            12        A.   I mean, I can talk about the problems

            13    that she had that she talked to me about and the

            14    symptoms that she has and the activities in her

            15    life that are affected.

            16        Q.   Okay.  And what would that opinion be?

            17        A.   Well, she told me that -- so she told

            18    me that she had intermittent and dull, sometimes

            19    sharp pain in her low back.  It ranged from a 3

            20    to 7 over 10 level of intensity.  That's a scale

            21    I ask them about where zero is no pain at all,

            22    10 is the worse pain they could ever imagine.



                                                                 76





             1             Pain radiating into both lower

             2    extremities, more marked on the right side than

             3    the left, numbness, tingling and weakness in

             4    both legs, more pain with prolonged sitting,

             5    standing, walking.  Attempted jogging,

             6    repetitive bending, stooping and lifting, she

             7    had problems with stiffness and weakness.

             8    Pushing, pulling, twisting activities bothered

             9    her back, and I think that's mostly the

            10    functional kind of stuff that we talked about.

            11        Q.   Great.  Thank you.  Well, one thing we

            12    did not talk about if subpoenaed to appear at

            13    trial, do you intend to offer any opinions as to

            14    the need for future treatment that you would

            15    relate to the Walmart incident?

            16        A.   So I didn't say anything about that,

            17    but my recommendation would be home exercise,

            18    stretching, strengthening, core strengthening

            19    program.

            20        Q.   Okay.  So then if you would recommend a

            21    home exercise program, is it fair to say that

            22    you would not offer any opinions at trial as to



                                                                 77





             1    future medical costs?

             2        A.   That's fair to say.

             3        Q.   Okay.  Now, I noted in your report I

             4    believe you noted that she, Ms. Vaughn, was not

             5    working at the time you saw her, correct?

             6        A.   No.  So she told me she was unemployed

             7    at the time of the injury.  When I saw her, she

             8    told me she was working at customer service.

             9        Q.   Forgive me, I meant to say at the time

            10    of the incident.  So -- and then she was

            11    working.  Okay.  So if subpoenaed to appear at

            12    trial, do you intend to offer any opinions as to

            13    whether Ms. Vaughn had to miss any time from

            14    work as related to this injury?

            15        A.   No.  She was unemployed, so I don't

            16    really think about time missed from work because

            17    she wasn't working at the time.

            18        Q.   Very good.  Doctor, have we talked

            19    about all of the opinions that you would offer

            20    at trial if subpoenaed to testify in this case?

            21        A.   I mean, I don't know.  If you ask me

            22    another question, I might have a different



                                                                 78





             1    opinion.  I mean, I think these are most of them

             2    that we're talking about.

             3             MS. KYLIS:  Excellent.  I believe those

             4    are all of my questions.

             5             THE WITNESS:  Okay.

             6             MS. KYLIS:  Mr. Kolker, do you have

             7    any?

             8             MR. KOLKER:  Just a couple things.

             9                       EXAMINATION

            10             BY MR. KOLKER:

            11        Q.   If she was employed at the time of

            12    surgery, would that surgery, this back surgery,

            13    necessitate time off of that job?

            14        A.   Yes.

            15             MR. KOLKER:  I don't have any other

            16    questions.

            17             MS. KYLIS:  I'm good, too.

            18             Thank you, Dr. Fechter.

            19             You have the right to review or you can

            20    waive -- based on your nonverbal wave there, I'm

            21    going to state for the record that you're going

            22    to waive reading and signing.

             1             THE WITNESS:  That's true.

             2             MS. KYLIS:  Well, wonderful.  Thank you

             3    so much for your time, Doctor.

             4             THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.

             5             (Reading and signature waived.)

             6             (Whereupon, at 4:53 p.m., the

             7    deposition was concluded.)

               1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are on record.

               3  witness.

               4               ELIZABETH A. SHEROIAN,

               5             WHO, BEING FIRST DULY SWORN,

               6                 TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  Defendants will continue

               8  their objection about the relevance of patient

               9  outcome information, and any references to

              10  patients should be done with initials.

              11                    EXAMINATION

              12  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

              13          Q.   Can you please state your full

              14  name for the record?

              15          A.   I'm Elizabeth Anne Sheroian.

              16          Q.   Sheroian.  Sheroian?

              17          A.   S-H-E --

              18          Q.   Is that correct?

              19          A.   -- E-R-O-I-A-N.

              20          Q.   I just want to make sure I

              21  pronounce it correctly.

              22          A.   Yeah.  If you think of the I as a

              23  Y, then it's a little easier.

              24          Q.   Sheroian?

              25          A.   Uh-huh.



                                                                6


               1          Q.   Sheroian.  Okay.

               2             My name is Jason Archinaco, and so

               3  my name is complicated in my own way,

               4  incidentally, so I understand.

               5             In any event, have you ever given a

               6  deposition before?

               7          A.   I have never.

               8          Q.   Okay.  We'll go through general

               9  ground rules with you up front.  First, are

              10  you being represented by counsel today?

              11          A.   By this gentleman here.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Yes.

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Mr. Wiencek?

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And that's through your

              16  former employment at Mercy, essentially?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Okay.  So counsel was appointed

              19  to you through the former employment, correct?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Okay.  So basic ground rules are

              22  there is a videographer here, but the court

              23  reporter is the official transcript.  She

              24  cannot take down two people speaking at the

              25  same time.  So essentially the way it works,



                                                                7


               1  almost like a television screenplay, except

               2  for one thing, which is, first, there is a

               3  question from me.  Then there is a potential

               4  objection from counsel.  If Mr. Wiencek makes

               5  an objection, normally you'll be allowed to

               6  answer.  However, please wait until the

               7  objection is done.  If he instructs you not to

               8  answer, that would be normally because of

               9  attorney-client privilege, then you normally

              10  are going to follow the instruction of

              11  counsel.  But please listen.  So first, it's

              12  question, then it's potential objection, so

              13  allow that to come out.

              14             Also, the reason I also say that to

              15  people is what can happen is we get a little

              16  conversational here, or we start talking over

              17  one another -- one another, people get

              18  excited, whatever the reason.  And so if you

              19  give a pause for an objection to potentially

              20  be stated, you give yourself a second to think

              21  before you answer a question.  And that keeps

              22  the transcript a lot cleaner.

              23             Also, you have to be affirmative in

              24  answers, yes and no, not shakes and nods of

              25  the head ultimately, because shakes and nods,



                                                                8


               1  although the court reporter can write those

               2  down, it has to be audible for an answer.  So

               3  you say yes or no, keep it audible.

               4             If for some reason you don't hear

               5  or understand a question from me, just simply

               6  tell me that.  Otherwise, if you answer a

               7  question, I'm going to assume you both heard

               8  it and understood it.

               9             Do those general ground rules,

              10  understood by you at this point?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Any reason you can think

              13  of today that you would not be able to give

              14  your best testimony?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Did you look at any documents in

              17  preparation for your deposition?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   And what type of documents did

              20  you look at?

              21          A.   Some emails.  Yeah, some emails.

              22          Q.   That you would have been on

              23  yourself?

              24          A.   Some that I have done.

              25          Q.   Some that others may have done?



                                                                9


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   Anything else, other than emails,

               3  that you can remember?

               4          A.   The affidavit.

               5          Q.   Okay.  That's an affidavit you

               6  prepared, or I'm sorry, that you signed?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Anything else you can

               9  think of?

              10          A.   I think that's just about it.

              11          Q.   Anything else?  I'm sorry.  No?

              12  That you can think of?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Approximately how many

              15  emails do you recall looking at?  You don't

              16  have to be exact, but approximate, if you can

              17  approximate.

              18          A.   30.

              19          Q.   Okay.

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  Next exhibit is,

              21  what, 124?

              22             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 124

              23  was marked for identification.)

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay.  So

               7  Mercy Health 002549, and this is a screen shot

               8  taken from Dr. Holland's cellphone.  And there

               9  are three nurses in this picture that appear.

              10  Do you know who these nurses are?

              11          A.   I do not.

              12          Q.   Okay.

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll object to this

              14  exhibit as being incomplete.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) All right.

              18             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 125

              19  was marked for identification.)

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And do you

              21  know any of the nurses in that photograph?

              22          A.   There is no date on this.  What

              23  is the date of this text?

              24          Q.   Well, I didn't ask you what the

              25  date was.  I asked you -- you're not here to



                                                               11


               1  ask me questions, ma'am.  You're here to

               2  answer them.

               3          A.   I don't recognize --

               4          Q.   Do you recognize any of the

               5  nurses in that photograph?

               6          A.   I do not.

               7          Q.   Okay.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll object to this

               9  as an incomplete document as well.

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Next is 126; is

              11  that correct?

              12             THE REPORTER:  Uh-huh.

              13             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 126

              14  was marked for identification.)

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Exhibit 126 is

              16  marked as Holland versus Mercy Health 002550.

              17  And there is a photograph in this text

              18  exchange.  Do you recognize any of the people

              19  in that photograph?

              20          A.   I recognize two of the people.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And who do you recognize?

              22          A.   Bill and Deb.

              23          Q.   So Bill is the person in the

              24  center?

              25          A.   Correct.



                                                               12


               1          Q.   And what is his name, full name?

               2          A.   I -- I don't remember Bill's last

               3  name.

               4          Q.   He was a nurse?

               5          A.   Yeah.  He was a nurse on the

               6  floor.  And Deb is -- was also the nurse on

               7  the floor, one of the nurses on the floor.

               8          Q.   Okay.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you recall

              11  -- do you recall what -- do you recall Deb's

              12  last name by any chance?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Now, I'll represent to you

              15  that this text is from Dr. Holland's, or this

              16  photograph, these texts are from Dr. Holland's

              17  cellphone.  And these were sent -- this was

              18  sent for New Year's 2019, this year.

              19             Did you have the opinion that any

              20  of the people in this photograph that you were

              21  able to identify disliked Dr. Holland?

              22          A.   I don't know.

              23          Q.   Okay.  Do you know what kind of

              24  relationship he and Deb had?

              25          A.   I don't know.



                                                               13


               1          Q.   Okay.  Deb is the person who is

               2  smiling and appears, is holding a drink, and

               3  is -- appears to be, in colloquial terms,

               4  giving the middle finger; is that right?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   She's on the other side, on the

               7  left?

               8          A.   Correct.

               9          Q.   Flexing her muscle?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   Okay.  You don't know who the

              12  person is holding the drink that --

              13          A.   I do not.

              14          Q.   Okay.  I'm sorry for getting it

              15  backwards.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.

              16             Did you know anything about -- did

              17  you have a good relationship with Bill, Nurse

              18  Bill?

              19          A.   It wasn't a close relationship.

              20  I mean, occasionally, if we had to discuss

              21  patients, but I mean, the office was separate

              22  from the floor, so I didn't talk to Bill every

              23  day.  More social occasions, like Christmas

              24  party sort of thing.

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               14


               1          A.   Occasionally, I would speak with

               2  Bill, yes.

               3          Q.   Did you get along with him fairly

               4  well?

               5          A.   I think so.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection to the

               8  incompleteness of this document.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Give me one

              10  second.

              11             I'll mark this as Exhibit 127.

              12  There is no photograph here, but this is 127.

              13             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 127

              14  was marked for identification.)

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And I'm just

              16  showing you Exhibit 127 -- 127 to reference a

              17  name, and then I wanted to reference you back

              18  to Exhibit 126, and see if that might jog your

              19  memory as to who the person might be.

              20             But in 127, which is a text

              21  exchange between Dr. Holland, and who is

              22  represented as, This is your, and then in all

              23  caps, BEST, all caps, NURSE, Peggy, hi.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, narrative.

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you -- do



                                                               15


               1  you recognize, by any chance, the person in

               2  Exhibit 126 in the right as a nurse named

               3  Peggy?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Did you know whether or not there

               6  was a nurse named Peggy that worked on the

               7  floor?

               8          A.   I don't know all the nurses on

               9  the floor.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              11          A.   Honestly, so ....

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection to the

              13  incompleteness of this document.

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  This is 128.

              15             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 128

              16  was marked for identification.)

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco)  Ms. Sheroian,

              18  this is -- this is something called -- their

              19  -- their -- the names of the patients and ages

              20  and sex have been redacted from the document

              21  in the column.  We have been identifying, or

              22  trying to identify people by initials, but

              23  instead, the patient name, age and sex were

              24  completely redacted, so you won't see those

              25  names in the column under patient, age and sex



                                                               16


               1  on this document.

               2             Do you, having had a chance to take

               3  a quick look at this, at the top it says,

               4  Hashmi, Fayyaz, 12/21/2016.  Do you see that?

               5          A.   I do.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And there is a notation

               7  there at 8:30 a.m.  Do you see how there is a

               8  notation at the top?

               9          A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.

              10          Q.   Okay.  And now, in the right,

              11  there is an identification, CA -- in

              12  handwriting, CABG/MVR began 8 a.m., ended

              13  1800.  Do you see that?

              14          A.   I do.

              15          Q.   And I'll represent to you I

              16  believe that's my client's handwriting there.

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              18  foundation.

              19          Q.   (Mr. Archinaco) And now, do you

              20  see there are a number of entries, 9, 9:20,

              21  9:40, 10:20, 10:40, 11:20, so on and so forth?

              22          A.   I do.

              23          Q.   Okay.  And I'll represent to you

              24  that there were patient names here across from

              25  those times.  Would that be consistent with



                                                               17


               1  your understanding that those would be

               2  scheduled times for office visits for

               3  patients?

               4          A.   I would think so.

               5          Q.   Now, I'm not asking you to --

               6  now, by the way, do you have any independent

               7  recollection of the events that occurred four

               8  days before Christmas on 12/21/2016?

               9          A.   I do not.

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  So I'll object to

              11  foundation for any further questions of this

              12  document.

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) So,

              14  Ms. Sheroian, I'm not going to ask you to

              15  agree that the times that my client has noted

              16  here are correct or not, given the fact that

              17  you don't recall.  But independent of that, do

              18  you have any knowledge as to times when

              19  Dr. Hashmi would schedule a surgery, and then

              20  for the same day, he would have clinic

              21  patients scheduled, and that because he was in

              22  surgery, and not out of surgery yet, that

              23  those patients would, instead of being seen by

              24  Dr. Hashmi, would be seen by a physician's

              25  assistant?



                                                               18


               1          A.   There is a lot of factors that

               2  play into that.  If this was an emergency

               3  case, then that would be true.  We would have

               4  a physician assistant see Dr. Hashmi's

               5  patients, or any doctor's patients.

               6             If we knew in advance, we would

               7  call the patients and ask them, is it okay if

               8  you see a physician assistant, or if you'd

               9  like to reschedule, so it depends on the

              10  circumstances.

              11          Q.   Okay.

              12          A.   Just a second.

              13          Q.   Is --

              14          A.   The reason why I do not recall

              15  this, I wasn't employed by Mercy --

              16          Q.   Okay.

              17          A.   -- at this time.

              18          Q.   Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  Fair

              19  enough.

              20          A.   Okay.

              21          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  When did you

              22  cease being employed at Mercy?

              23          A.   It was February 2016.

              24          Q.   Okay.  So just to go over this

              25  for a second, if a patient -- all right.  Let



                                                               19


               1  me go back a second.

               2             So if a patient was scheduled for

               3  surgery, and it was a planned versus an

               4  emergent procedure, in that situation, you

               5  might have more lead time in order to call

               6  patients, so that they could -- you could

               7  schedule the consult, so that they would know

               8  they're seeing a physician assistant?

               9          A.   There is a difference between the

              10  consultations, which always need to be seen by

              11  a physician, as opposed to a recheck, which

              12  could be seen by a physician's assistant.

              13          Q.   Okay.  So when you say

              14  consultation, are you saying in the hospital

              15  or postdischarge?

              16          A.   I'm talking about a consultation

              17  in the office, before surgery, the patient

              18  always needs to see the surgeon ahead of time,

              19  so we could reschedule those patients.

              20          Q.   All right.  So I -- I have in

              21  mind what you're saying.

              22          A.   Uh-huh.

              23          Q.   Essentially what -- there is a

              24  mix of patients that come to an office,

              25  correct?



                                                               20


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   And certain -- in instances where

               3  there is -- there is an initial meeting,

               4  oftentimes, in advance -- well, strike that.

               5             Usually, there is a meeting in

               6  advance of a surgery, where the surgeon meets

               7  with the patient and obtains what is known as

               8  consent, or informed consent, depending on

               9  what jurisdiction you're in, correct?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And so, in that instance, where a

              12  patient, for example, if a doctor wound up

              13  going into a surgery, it took longer than

              14  expected, or he wasn't going to be available

              15  that day, in that instance, you would be able

              16  to reschedule that type of patient for a

              17  different day, so that they could do the

              18  consent, because those had to happen with the

              19  surgeon, essentially?

              20          A.   Ab -- absolutely.

              21          Q.   Okay.  So there is different

              22  types of patients.  And there is other type of

              23  patient that is simply coming to the office

              24  for a consult, postop, not emergently, just

              25  your routine follow-up visit?



                                                               21


               1          A.   That's not a consultation.

               2  That's a recheck appointment.

               3          Q.   Okay.  A recheck appointment?

               4          A.   Uh-huh.

               5          Q.   In the instance of a recheck, it

               6  could be a physician's assistant that would

               7  see the patient?

               8          A.   Yes, if the doctor was

               9  unavailable.

              10          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              11             And then were you a person who

              12  would -- let me go back a second.

              13             You had a lot of functions in your

              14  day-to-day role in running the office; is that

              15  right?

              16          A.   That is correct.

              17          Q.   Okay.  So let's go back, because

              18  I think I -- I gave you the photos first.  Ed

              19  -- what is your educational background?  I

              20  skipped over all of that.

              21          A.   I have a lot of practical

              22  experience.  I have some college.  I worked in

              23  physicians' offices since I was 20, and I

              24  worked my way up.

              25          Q.   So you worked from different



                                                               22


               1  practice groups, and then into the hospital

               2  setting, is that -- tell me -- tell me, if you

               3  can give me kind of a career arc, like

               4  highlight, that led you to ultimately the job

               5  where you work?

               6          A.   I worked for a general surgeon

               7  back in Florida for -- as a receptionist.  I

               8  worked for a pediatrician in the billing and

               9  reception.  I worked for an OB-GYN here in

              10  Toledo.  And then I lucked out and got into

              11  Surgicore, Dr. Zacharias' group, which was the

              12  cardiac surgeons.  I started there in 1991 as

              13  their practice manager.

              14          Q.   And then -- and then after that

              15  group, then was that with basically, that

              16  group was stationed at Mercy at that time?

              17          A.   It was stationed at Mercy.  It

              18  was a private practice, though.

              19          Q.   Okay.

              20          A.   So I didn't become a hospital

              21  employee until I left there.  I did research

              22  for two years, and then Dr. Hashmi and

              23  Dr. Burdine wanted me to join their practice

              24  as their practice manager.

              25          Q.   And when did you join with them?



                                                               23


               1  You're welcome to check -- you have a -- you

               2  have a little diary there to check some dates?

               3          A.   I only have a couple.

               4          Q.   That's okay.

               5          A.   No.  I want to make sure.

               6          Q.   That's fine.

               7          A.   Okay.  So officially, I joined

               8  them in September of 2010.

               9          Q.   And your diary has actually

              10  resulted in quite a funny response to -- for

              11  me, at least, as to why you wouldn't remember

              12  12/21/16, because you were actually not there?

              13          A.   Right.

              14          Q.   You were gone.  So in any event,

              15  September 2010?

              16          A.   Correct.

              17          Q.   Okay.  So essentially, you had

              18  been -- you had gone -- you had learned

              19  various aspect of practice management over the

              20  years from job to job, and eventually you

              21  culminate in obtaining this job in or about

              22  September of 2010, with Dr. Hashmi and

              23  Dr. Burdine asking you to be involved?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Okay.  And at that point, were



                                                               24


               1  you employed by Mercy itself?

               2          A.   I was.  I actually did two jobs

               3  for a while for about six months, so I -- from

               4  September until April 2011, I was actually

               5  doing two jobs, the NCDR registry and also

               6  practice manager for Mercy cardiothoracic.

               7          Q.   By the time you arrived,

               8  Dr. Brunsting was -- was he there at all or

               9  no?

              10          A.   We hired him.

              11          Q.   And do you recall what -- why --

              12  what -- what he was hired -- why he was hired,

              13  or what he --

              14          A.   He had expertise in an area of

              15  cardiac surgery.

              16          Q.   What area was that?

              17          A.   I'm trying to remember.  I don't

              18  recall exactly what it was, but he had a

              19  strength that -- that could help our practice.

              20          Q.   I'll throw out -- I'll throw some

              21  terms out and tell me, and you can say no, you

              22  don't remember, you do or not; robotics and

              23  then there is something called minimally

              24  invasive?

              25          A.   I don't recall which one he was



                                                               25


               1  better at, or which one he was proficient in.

               2          Q.   Fair enough.  And in terms of

               3  when you first started with Dr. Hashmi and

               4  Dr. Burdine, how were referrals called in to

               5  the office, in terms of who would be selected

               6  to perform a surgery, a heart surgery?

               7          A.   We would receive calls in the

               8  office, and whoever was on call would get that

               9  -- would get that referral.

              10          Q.   Okay.

              11          A.   Unless the referring doctor

              12  specified otherwise.

              13          Q.   And -- and incidentally, is that

              14  the same system that basically was employed on

              15  a go-forward basis, irrespective of who came

              16  and went into the practice?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   So even when Dr. Brunsting

              19  dropped out, Dr. Holland came in, and then

              20  also, I think, your time period would have

              21  included Dr. Phillips as well, I think?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   Okay.  So irrespective of the

              24  time period, that general practice is what you

              25  followed in the office itself in terms of



                                                               26


               1  referrals, correct?

               2          A.   Correct.

               3          Q.   Now, the on-call schedule, who

               4  would set that, to your knowledge?

               5          A.   The three surgeons would sit down

               6  and talk about the on-call schedule.  They

               7  would discuss who wanted to have some vacation

               8  time, and then they would talk about it, and

               9  then decide, and then let me know.

              10          Q.   If a physician called in and

              11  asked for a specific doctor, as opposed to

              12  just who was on call, would that be noted

              13  anywhere?

              14          A.   That should be noted.

              15          Q.   And what types of records would

              16  be made in terms of who the doctor

              17  specifically requested?

              18          A.   There was a consultation log.

              19          Q.   And that would have an indication

              20  then as to who called in the case and

              21  requested whom, correct?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   Okay.  To the best of your

              24  knowledge, when you ceased being employed at

              25  Mercy, did that consultation log, or strike



                                                               27


               1  that.

               2             Did it -- is a consultation log

               3  something that once it gets filled up, you go

               4  to the next book and so on and so forth, or

               5  how does that work?  Was it electronic?

               6          A.   No, it was handwritten.

               7          Q.   Okay.  It was in a book of some

               8  sort?

               9          A.   It was sheets of paper on a

              10  clipboard, and then kept in a file cabinet.

              11          Q.   To the best of your knowledge

              12  when you left Mercy, that would have still

              13  been intact in the practice group?

              14          A.   As far as I know.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And then would that also

              16  indicate when a case would go to someone on

              17  call, as opposed to specifically asked to be

              18  called into a doctor?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   Okay.  I might jump through the

              21  years here and there.

              22          A.   That's okay.

              23          Q.   Because there is a lot of years.

              24  So I will try to cover a couple of things here

              25  and there, and -- and then there is some



                                                               28


               1  documents and things I'll show you.

               2             Were you -- do you recall being

               3  involved at all in Dr. Holland's recruitment

               4  to come to Toledo?

               5          A.   I -- in his recruitment?

               6          Q.   Yes.

               7          A.   No, not in his recruitment.

               8          Q.   Okay.  When did you first become

               9  at all involved?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did you

              10  become involved then in terms of on-boarding

              11  him, once it was already determined he was

              12  going to come in?  When did you become

              13  involved?

              14          A.   When the doctors, or -- or when

              15  Toledo Clinic had made their decision to work

              16  with us, and -- and he would come in for an

              17  interview, the doctors would come in for an

              18  interview, you know, I would meet them and say

              19  hi and that sort of thing, different doctors.

              20          Q.   And had there ever been a prior

              21  situation in the practice group, where a

              22  doctor was going to be situated in the

              23  practice group, but they were not "employed"

              24  by Mercy?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               29


               1          Q.   This was the first one you had

               2  seen, correct?

               3          A.   Correct.

               4          Q.   And you're not the person who set

               5  up the reporting lines in terms of the

               6  management structure that would then occur

               7  from what happened when Dr. Holland?

               8          A.   I was a day-to-day operations

               9  practice manager.  Those types of decisions

              10  and -- were done by someone above me, so ....

              11          Q.   Well, example though, so here you

              12  are as the practice manager, basically

              13  employed at Mercy, correct?

              14          A.   (Witness nods head.)

              15          Q.   And at a time when Dr. Hashmi and

              16  Burdine, and then Dr. Holland joins, just with

              17  that in mind, okay?

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   And so now what happens is a

              20  surgeon, who you're told is employed by Toledo

              21  Clinic, correct?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   Is put into the practice group,

              24  correct?

              25          A.   Affiliated with, yes.



                                                               30


               1          Q.   All right.  But working out of

               2  your offices, essentially, correct?

               3          A.   Yes, but I believe Dr. Holland

               4  had his own office over at Toledo Clinic too.

               5          Q.   What makes you think that?

               6          A.   Because Peggy Trapp from Toledo

               7  Clinic said that Dr. Holland was interested in

               8  setting up an office, and they wanted to

               9  create space for him.

              10          Q.   You don't know if that ever

              11  actually happened, though?

              12          A.   I don't know that.

              13          Q.   And I don't want you to speculate

              14  or guess today.

              15          A.   Yeah.

              16          Q.   And do you recall, when

              17  Dr. Holland was coming in, being involved in

              18  any conversations, to the best of your

              19  knowledge, about marketing issues that were

              20  arising, because Dr. Holland was going to be

              21  "employed" by Toledo Clinic, but he was going

              22  to be working out of your practice group?

              23          A.   I know Dr. Holland met with

              24  marketing people, but those types of

              25  conversations and decisions were above me.



                                                               31


               1          Q.   Before I start handing out

               2  emails, just to be clear, there are emails

               3  you're carbon copied on.

               4          A.   Uh-huh.

               5          Q.   And so that doesn't mean simply

               6  because you're carbon copied you're the

               7  decisionmaker on something.  You might be

               8  informed of things that are going on in the

               9  office, because you're the office manager,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   So decisions in terms of how the

              13  corporate, you know, how the contract with

              14  Dr. Holland was set up, that was well -- that

              15  was above you, correct?

              16          A.   Correct.

              17          Q.   You had no involvement in that

              18  whatsoever, correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   And you're not the one who set up

              21  any reporting lines of Dr. Holland, because he

              22  was Toledo Clinic "employee" working out of

              23  your practice group, you're not the person who

              24  set up his reporting lines above him, correct?

              25          A.   Correct.



                                                               32


               1          Q.   So this was the first time that

               2  you had ever been an office manager in a

               3  situation where someone had taken an

               4  "employee" of some other entity, and basically

               5  situated them in your practice group that you

               6  had previously been running for Mercy

               7  employees only, correct?

               8          A.   Correct.

               9          Q.   So this was a unique situation,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Posed challenges above your pay

              13  grade at times, correct?

              14          A.   I can only imagine.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  Next exhibit

              16  I'm going to hand out is Exhibit 129.

              17             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 129

              18  was marked for identification.)

              19          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And to be

              20  clear, you'll have -- you can take a look at

              21  these, and review them, and have an

              22  opportunity.

              23             On the second page, there is an

              24  email from you to Mary Deming, and there is a

              25  response from Mary Deming.  And so if you want



                                                               33


               1  to just take a quick look at these.  I'm

               2  giving these in reference, so I can ask you

               3  some questions about marketing and

               4  Dr. Holland/business cards.  That's where I'm

               5  going to ask you some questions.

               6          A.   Okay.  What questions do you have

               7  about this?

               8          Q.   Okay.  Now, this is -- you're

               9  carbon copied at the top from an email

              10  April 18th, 2013 from Mary Deming.  Do you see

              11  that?

              12          A.   I do.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And then there is

              14  basically a discussion about marketing issues

              15  that are going to be run pertaining to

              16  Dr. Holland, correct?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   And did you have an understanding

              19  that because of the way Dr. Holland was being

              20  employed, that there were issues with

              21  marketing and/or his business cards that had

              22  to be run past Mercy's legal department?

              23          A.   I don't know about the legal

              24  department.  I do know about the marketing

              25  department.



                                                               34


               1          Q.   Okay.

               2          A.   But I don't know about legal.

               3          Q.   Fair enough.  I mean, can you

               4  tell me what you can recall from that

               5  generally, to the best of your recollection?

               6          A.   It was a new situation for, I

               7  think, most of us.  And so we were tying to

               8  figure out how to handle things, with a Toledo

               9  Clinic-employed physician.

              10          Q.   Did anyone ever explain to you

              11  why the relationship had been set up the way

              12  it was with Dr. Holland, that you can recall?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Okay.  All right.  There is some

              15  binders in front of you.  There is an exhibit.

              16  There is two different binders.  There is

              17  Volume I and Volume II.

              18          A.   Uh-huh.

              19          Q.   Volume I, you'll see the

              20  documents are all behind the tab, not in front

              21  of.  So the first volume has 75 exhibits in

              22  it.  I would like you to refer to Exhibit 43,

              23  please.

              24          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              25          Q.   And 43 appears to be -- we have



                                                               35


               1  three pages here, with 43, so if you don't

               2  mind, just give me one second.

               3             There is three pages, but the first

               4  page I wanted to ask you about briefly.

               5          A.   These are the first time that I'm

               6  seeing these.

               7          Q.   Okay.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  I'll object to lack

               9  of foundation.  She's not addressed or copied

              10  on this.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Ms. Sheroian,

              12  I guess my question is, let me see if I have

              13  another email.  Give me one second.

              14             Was there ever a time that it was

              15  discussed with you anything with regard to

              16  Dr. Hashmi's contract and his wRVU requirement

              17  contained in it?

              18          A.   Dr. Hashmi asked me for his R --

              19  wRVUs, the -- the numbers, but that was it.  I

              20  didn't see Dr. Hashmi's contract.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And that just -- I'll ask

              22  it now.  You didn't -- did you ever see

              23  Dr. Holland's contract?

              24          A.   I never saw Dr. Holland's

              25  contract.



                                                               36


               1          Q.   Okay.  So other than being asked

               2  to potentially get numbers or statistics for

               3  Dr. Hashmi, you did, and you did that, if you

               4  were asked to do that, wRVU, you didn't

               5  understand it had anything whatsoever to do

               6  with his contract, correct?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Do you ever recall what

               9  guidance was given from marketing with regard

              10  to Dr. Holland and marketing, in terms of how

              11  he would be marketed?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   Do you recall what his business

              14  card said?

              15          A.   I don't know if he had more than

              16  one business card.  I was trying to remember.

              17  I thought he asked for an individual card,

              18  with his cellphone number on it, in addition

              19  to the one that had the three physicians'

              20  names on it.

              21          Q.   The three physician name, does

              22  that appear on a Mercy business card?

              23          A.   It does.

              24          Q.   Okay.  And then Dr. Holland's

              25  other business card, do you recall he -- you



                                                               37


               1  thought he had a second business card?

               2          A.   I thought he had a second

               3  business card, business card, with just his

               4  cellphone number on it, so he could hand it

               5  out to patients, so they could call him

               6  directly.

               7          Q.   Have you ever seen that business

               8  card?

               9          A.   I don't remember if it was

              10  printed at Mercy, or if Toledo Clinic printed

              11  it.  That's just what I remember.

              12          Q.   So that card may have had Toledo

              13  Clinic's logo on it, as opposed to Mercy's?

              14          A.   I've never -- I -- I don't know.

              15          Q.   Okay.  You have not seen that

              16  card?

              17          A.   I don't remember seeing that

              18  card.  I just remember the conversation.

              19          Q.   About Dr. Holland would like to

              20  have his cellphone on a business card?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Did you ever discuss with

              23  Dr. Holland whether, for the entirety of his

              24  career, he typically handed out his cellphone

              25  to his patients?



                                                               38


               1          A.   He said he did.

               2          Q.   Did Dr. Hashmi also provide his

               3  cellphone to patients as well?

               4          A.   I don't know.

               5          Q.   How about Dr. Phillips, do you

               6  recall?

               7          A.   I don't know.

               8          Q.   Dr. Burdine?

               9          A.   I don't know.  Usually the

              10  standard was to call the office number, and

              11  then we would locate the doctor.

              12          Q.   Do you -- do you think it shows

              13  -- strike that.

              14             Do you know Dr. Kabour?

              15          A.   I do know Dr. Kabour.

              16          Q.   Do you know whether or not

              17  Dr. Kabour hands out his cellphone to

              18  patients?

              19          A.   I have no idea.

              20          Q.   Okay.  All right.  Exhibit 44 and

              21  45 in the binder are related, so if you can

              22  turn to those.

              23          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              24          Q.   Okay.  So Exhibit 44 is from you

              25  to Jayne Beckstead dated April -- this is an



                                                               39


               1  email -- dated April 29, 2013.  And then

               2  Exhibit 45 is from you to Greg Hood, dated

               3  May 28th, 2013.

               4             I want to start with Exhibit 44,

               5  April 29th.  And you told Ms. Beckstead that

               6  Dr. Hashmi went into your office and spoke to

               7  him about an incident with Dr. Burdine.  And

               8  I'm wondering if you can recall what that

               9  incident was about?

              10          A.   Unfortunately, no.

              11          Q.   Do you recall many incidents

              12  between Dr. Hashmi and Burdine?

              13          A.   I would say there was a normal

              14  number of incidents.  Whenever you have

              15  partners, there is always going to be some

              16  disagreements, but these were -- these were

              17  relatively minor incidents.  It wasn't a great

              18  number.

              19          Q.   What did you do, if anything, to

              20  try to balance egos between the surgeons in

              21  the office, if you did?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to form.

              23          A.   I am a natural peacekeeper.  I

              24  tried my best to sooth egos and try to make

              25  everything work as smoothly as possible, to



                                                               40


               1  identify the problem, and see if we could come

               2  up with a resolution for it.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Exhibit 45, just skip to

               4  the next one.

               5          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

               6          Q.   And there is a series of emails,

               7  and you'll see that it concludes with the

               8  meeting being cancelled, it appears.

               9          A.   Uh-huh.

              10          Q.   But once you've had a chance to

              11  review those, just let me know.

              12          A.   Okay.  (Doing as indicated.)

              13  Okay.

              14          Q.   There is a reference here in

              15  May 28, 2013, in your email to Greg Hood, a cc

              16  to Jayne Beckstead, and Ms. Hatlay, that you

              17  were concerned about what might happen in a

              18  meeting.  And in particular, you wrote, "I

              19  anticipate Dr. Burdine will criticize the PAs,

              20  saying that he receives no support, and

              21  destroy the team morale with the PAs".

              22             Do you recall anything surrounding

              23  this in terms of what you were concerned about

              24  at the time?

              25          A.   I think the email states it as



                                                               41


               1  clearly as what I possibly could, in that he

               2  felt he was not receiving support from the

               3  PAs.  And he could be pretty -- he could be

               4  pretty intense about things, so I was

               5  concerned for the PAs.

               6          Q.   Did you ever recall him, or

               7  Dr. Burdine, making any comments in your

               8  presence about anyone's religion, race, or

               9  ethnicity?

              10          A.   Never.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Was that in regard to

              12  Dr. Burdine?

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yes, Dr. Burdine.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Okay.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Next exhibit

              16  is Exhibit 47 in your binder.  We're up to

              17  October of 2013, for better or worse.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   Jim Burdine memo that you are one

              20  of the people that received it.  And I'd just

              21  like to have you review this for a moment, and

              22  then once you've had a chance, I'll ask you a

              23  couple of questions about this.

              24          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              25          Q.   Do you recall the circumstances



                                                               42


               1  surrounding Dr. Burdine sending this memo on

               2  or about October 8, 2013, other than what is

               3  stated here by any chance?

               4          A.   There was confusion.  We wanted

               5  to make sure everyone understood the correct

               6  protocol, from the front office staff, to the

               7  PAs, to the physicians, about how incoming

               8  consultation calls are to be handled.

               9          Q.   And what is your recollection as

              10  to how the confusion got caused, if you were

              11  ever able to figure that out?

              12          A.   I don't know if it was a specific

              13  instance, where -- where -- I don't know.  I

              14  don't remember what the specific instance, or

              15  if it was more than one instance.  I don't

              16  remember.

              17          Q.   So essentially, the memo was sent

              18  out to clarify, so that people had an

              19  understanding of which way the procedure

              20  should go forward, correct?

              21          A.   Exactly.

              22          Q.   And you were, obviously, being a

              23  person who had to manage this practice in

              24  favor of order, as opposed to chaos?

              25          A.   Always.



                                                               43


               1          Q.   Okay.  Next is Exhibit 50.  And

               2  I'm not going to ask you to read the substance

               3  of this.  I just want you to look at the

               4  header.

               5             Do you ever recall -- well, before

               6  you -- before you read any contents in it.  Do

               7  you ever recall seeing any letter from

               8  Dr. Holland to Mr. Arquilla about issues

               9  pertaining to nursing safety?

              10          A.   This will be the first time that

              11  I've read this email.

              12          Q.   All right.  So then we don't want

              13  you to -- I'm not trying to educate you

              14  through it, so you've not seen this document

              15  before today, correct?

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   So you're not being asked to read

              18  it.  You can move on from there.

              19             Exhibit 51, if you can turn to

              20  that.

              21          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              22          Q.   And at the top is an email from

              23  you to Dr. Hashmi, do you see that, dated

              24  November 19, 2013?

              25          A.   I do.



                                                               44


               1          Q.   And you're noting, This could be

               2  interesting.  It opens the door for shared

               3  support services, if Dr. Holland decides to

               4  retire.

               5             Did I read that correctly?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   Dr. Holland had just started in

               8  April of 2013; is that right?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   And do you, as you sit here

              11  today, do you have any recollection as to why

              12  you would be saying, or speaking to Dr. Hashmi

              13  about Dr. Holland potentially retiring?

              14          A.   Dr. Holland mentioned it.

              15          Q.   So you believe that Dr. Holland

              16  mentioned potentially retiring.  When was the

              17  first time you recall him mentioning that?

              18          A.   It was -- it was shortly before

              19  this.  I was surprised, but that was what he

              20  had mentioned.

              21          Q.   And did he just mention it to

              22  you, or do you recall in what context it was

              23  mentioned?

              24          A.   It was just a conversation, like

              25  a hallway conversation that we had.  Maybe in



                                                               45


               1  -- in my office, I don't remember exactly

               2  where it was, but it was just like one of

               3  those little conversations that you have.

               4          Q.   And what is your recollection

               5  about what was said?

               6          A.   Well, he -- he was interested in

               7  retiring early.  A lot of surgeons don't work,

               8  you know, very late in life.  And I just

               9  remember that he was thinking about retiring

              10  early, maybe to do some boating, maybe to go

              11  out there and enjoy life a little bit more.

              12             He had spoken to me about finding

              13  out what the status on his Florida licensure

              14  was like, if it was still intact or not, so

              15  you know, there were different things that he

              16  would ask me to check on, that made me think

              17  that he was looking at other avenues, in

              18  addition to retirement.

              19          Q.   Okay.  Well, so -- so did he tell

              20  you at that point, in or about 2013, did he

              21  say anything to you about his finances, and

              22  that he was independently wealthy, and that he

              23  could retire?

              24          A.   I didn't ask him.

              25          Q.   Now, did -- did you sense any



                                                               46


               1  frustrations at that point on Dr. Holland's

               2  part that he was discussing with you?

               3          A.   We had discussions, where we both

               4  talked about our frustrations, me about him,

               5  and him about me.

               6          Q.   And you had those discussions

               7  with each other?

               8          A.   We did.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And what was the -- why

              10  were you having those discussions?

              11          A.   Well, we were having those

              12  discussions because we were both frustrated

              13  and angry about how -- how some things were

              14  being handled.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Did Dr. Holland explain to

              16  you his frustration with the referral issues,

              17  that Dr. Hashmi was getting a disproportionate

              18  number of referrals?

              19          A.   He mentioned it.

              20          Q.   Did you feel that that was

              21  directed at you personally?

              22          A.   I don't -- I didn't take it that

              23  way.

              24          Q.   Did you get the impression at

              25  that point that Dr. Holland was suggesting



                                                               47


               1  somehow that you were responsible for

               2  overriding or changing what were supposed to

               3  be the typical way that referrals were

               4  occurring?

               5          A.   Why would I do that?  It doesn't

               6  make sense.

               7          Q.   And that's what I'm asking is,

               8  whether or not Dr. Holland ever said anything

               9  like that to you.  He didn't, right?

              10          A.   I don't remember him saying

              11  anything like that to me.  I know he was

              12  frustrated, because he wasn't -- he felt like

              13  he wasn't doing enough surgeries.  And I think

              14  he was looking for a reason why.

              15          Q.   Did you ever hear Dr. Burdine

              16  express similar frustrations?

              17          A.   No.  Dr. Burdine's role changed

              18  in the practice.  He went more toward

              19  thoracic, so that was his area of expertise,

              20  that was his focus.  So he was getting a lot

              21  of case, a lot of thoracic cases.

              22          Q.   Did you ever hear Dr. Brunsting

              23  ever express any frustrations about referrals?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Did you ever have personal



                                                               48


               1  conversations with Dr. Brunsting?

               2          A.   About what?

               3          Q.   About referrals?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Did you ever have any discussions

               6  with Dr. Phillips about referrals?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   Do you ever recall Dr. Phillips

               9  complaining in your presence that he wasn't

              10  getting referrals either?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   So in terms of Exhibit 51, you

              13  were unaware that five days prior to this

              14  email you sent to Dr. Hashmi, that Dr. Holland

              15  raised, in writing, complaints about nursing

              16  care, and that things weren't being done about

              17  it?

              18          A.   I don't --

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              20          A.   I didn't get any email like that.

              21  I didn't -- I was unaware.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              23  mischaracterization.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did Dr. Hashmi

              25  ever tell you that Dr. Holland had reported



                                                               49


               1  safety issues pertaining to Dr. Hashmi to the

               2  management at Mercy?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Did you ever learn, from any

               5  source, that Dr. Holland had made reports to

               6  anyone at Mercy about safety issues with

               7  regard to Dr. Hashmi?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   Did you ever learn that

              10  Dr. Phillips made any complaints to management

              11  about Dr. Hashmi and safety issues?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   Did Doctor -- you never heard

              14  Dr. Phillips complain, in your presence, about

              15  any quality issues with regard to Dr. Hashmi?

              16          A.   No.

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  What is the next

              18  exhibit, Exhibit 130?  Exhibit 130.

              19             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 130

              20  was marked for identification.)

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Had a chance

              22  to quickly review that email --

              23          A.   I see it --

              24          Q.   -- chain?

              25          A.   -- yes.



                                                               50


               1          Q.   At the top, it's an email from

               2  you to Jaime Hatlay about Toledo Clinic.  You

               3  wrote, There has been no information from

               4  Toledo Clinic as to office hours there.  I

               5  believe Dr. Holland will only be seeing

               6  patients in our office.

               7             Did I read that correctly?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Does that refresh your

              10  recollection as to whether or not Dr. Holland

              11  had an office at the Toledo Clinic?

              12          A.   At that time -- at that time, he

              13  did not have an office.  And the only reason

              14  why I say that is based on the fact that no

              15  one ever told me anything, as far as Toledo

              16  Clinic hours and patients being seen over

              17  there, anything.  He may have had an office

              18  over there, but I don't know.

              19          Q.   Okay.  You were on -- in the

              20  binder, you were on Exhibit 51, where we were

              21  referencing the retirement.  If you can turn

              22  to the next exhibit in the binder, Exhibit 52.

              23          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              24          Q.   And then let me know when you've

              25  had a chance to review that.



                                                               51


               1          A.   Okay.  What question do you have

               2  about this?

               3          Q.   Well, there is -- it looks like

               4  you gave some information to Dr. Hashmi for a

               5  meeting he was having in early January 2014

               6  with regard to the number of cases, correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   And did he -- do you have any

               9  recollection as to what this meeting was

              10  about?

              11          A.   I don't know.

              12          Q.   Were you ever informed that in

              13  January of 2014, that Dr. Holland had a

              14  meeting with Tom Arquilla and

              15  Scott Porterfield pertaining to referrals or

              16  any other matter?

              17          A.   I don't know.  I didn't keep

              18  Dr. Holland's calendar.  He kept his own

              19  calendar.  He let me know about meetings that

              20  he wanted me to know about, so I don't know

              21  about all of his meetings.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Did you hear anything

              23  discussed in the office about any meeting that

              24  Dr. Holland, that you recall, any meeting that

              25  he had in January of 2014, where he raised any



                                                               52


               1  quality or safety issues?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Next exhibit is 131.

               4             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 131

               5  was marked for identification.)

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll object to this

               7  one, based on the lack of foundation.  She's

               8  not addressed here or cc'd.

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Mr. Bertke is

              10  testifying tomorrow, so ...

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Ms. Sheroian,

              12  you're not carbon copied here.  I'm putting

              13  something in context for you to read in terms

              14  of the time of March of 2014, and then ask you

              15  some questions around this time period.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   I know you're not carbon copied

              18  on this, to be clear.  Do you have any

              19  recollection about any complaints, or anything

              20  being said about Dr. Holland and Burdine not

              21  being invited to meetings while Dr. Hashmi was

              22  being invited to meetings?

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   Move on to the next one.  132,

              25  This is Exhibit 132.



                                                               53


               1             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 132

               2  was marked for identification.)

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay.  We're

               4  going to take a break after this exhibit as

               5  well, so we've been going about an hour.

               6          A.   Okay.  What question do you have?

               7          Q.   Okay.  This is from April 2014

               8  time period, Mr. -- Dr. Hashmi is, or I'm

               9  sorry.  You're asking Dr. Hashmi about whether

              10  or not he needs to be present for the

              11  interview of a candidate for the position of

              12  nurse cardiology manager at St. Anne's.

              13             Do you see that?

              14          A.   I do.

              15          Q.   And you were asking if he wanted

              16  to participate in the interview, and he said

              17  he didn't need to be there, correct?

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   What was your understanding as to

              20  who -- strike that.

              21             What was your understanding as to

              22  what Dr. Holland was doing with St. Anne's, in

              23  terms of trying to build a program there, if

              24  any, and then after that response, we'll take

              25  a break.



                                                               54


               1          A.   Dr. Holland, as a Toledo Clinic

               2  physician, right next to St. Anne's, we were

               3  hoping that the referral base would come more

               4  so from Toledo Clinic, with Dr. Holland being

               5  the surgeon there, and it would help build the

               6  program at St. Anne's.

               7          Q.   Do you recall Dr. Holland being

               8  involved in actually setting up the St. Anne's

               9  program?

              10          A.   I believe the St. Anne's program

              11  was set up before Dr. Holland arrived.

              12          Q.   And what makes you think that?

              13          A.   The timeline.

              14          Q.   Who do you think set up the

              15  St. Anne's cardio -- cardiothoracic program,

              16  if it wasn't Dr. Holland?

              17          A.   I thought it was Dr. Hashmi.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Let's take a break.  Thank

              19  you.

              20             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record.

              21             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              22  6:32 until 6:47.)

              23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We're

              24  back on record.

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) With regard to



                                                               55


               1  -- I asked you some questions about retirement

               2  earlier.  Do you recall if Dr. Holland gave

               3  you any specifics as to what sounded like his

               4  timeline and when he wanted to retire?

               5          A.   No.  He was speaking in

               6  generalities.

               7          Q.   Sharing you, with you a dream of

               8  being on a boat somewhere, floating around, as

               9  opposed to day-to-day grind of being a

              10  surgeon?

              11          A.   Well, it does sound appealing,

              12  doesn't it?

              13          Q.   Just a follow-up on the call

              14  procedures.  When -- this is just more of a

              15  technical issue.  When a call would come in to

              16  the office for a referral, or what have you,

              17  who would typically answer the phone and keep

              18  the log, and then would the person note who

              19  they were on the log that they kept the log?

              20  I know that's multiple questions there, but I

              21  just wanted to just cut through it, if you

              22  could just explain that.

              23          A.   Anyone could answer the phone.

              24  It could be the front office lady, it could be

              25  the nurse, it could be myself.  We all



                                                               56


               1  answered the phones, because they were busy.

               2             And then if a consultation came in,

               3  what we would do is we would let the person

               4  know this doctor is on call, and is it okay if

               5  this doctor sees the patient, because

               6  sometimes the doctor will say, call, you know,

               7  call the office, and wouldn't specify a

               8  surgeon.  So we would always ask, okay, this

               9  doctor is on call, is that okay?  And then the

              10  referring doctor would make the decision as to

              11  who that consultation would go to, and then we

              12  would make a note and -- and page it out.

              13          Q.   Did you ever hear of any

              14  procedure, where Dr. Hashmi would take

              15  cellphone calls directly outside of the office

              16  for referrals, as opposed to having them go

              17  through the office themselves?

              18          A.   I don't know.  I only know about

              19  the calls that came into the office.

              20          Q.   But to the best of your

              21  knowledge, the way the procedure should

              22  operate would be to go -- calls to go into the

              23  office for referrals, correct?

              24          A.   Correct.

              25          Q.   I showed you a memo that



                                                               57


               1  Dr. Burdine authored.  Do you recall whether

               2  you assisted him in drafting it?

               3          A.   Which memo are you referring to?

               4          Q.   Let me refer you back to it.

               5  It's Exhibit 47.  Sorry.

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Going back to the log for

               8  one second.  In terms of the log and how it's

               9  kept, who would write the name -- who would

              10  write the entries into the log?

              11          A.   The person who took the call.

              12          Q.   So the log was kept jointly

              13  between whoever was answering the phone?

              14          A.   It was kept up front, and so you

              15  would go up front, I would go up front and

              16  make a notation, so that everyone could see

              17  what was going on.

              18          Q.   Okay.  So when the -- when the

              19  log was created, when, depending on who made

              20  the entry, aside from it just being someone's

              21  handwriting, would someone make a notation as

              22  to who was making the entry, how did that

              23  work?

              24          A.   I believe there was a place that

              25  the person taking the call would initial or



                                                               58


               1  write their name.

               2          Q.   Okay.  When Dr. Holland came, and

               3  it was Dr. Holland, Dr. Hashmi, and

               4  Dr. Burdine, who was it -- strike that.

               5             Who did you report to in --

               6          A.   I reported -- you talking

               7  administratively or within the practice?

               8          Q.   Well, let's start admin -- yeah.

               9  It might be two different things.  I think you

              10  pointed that out.  Administratively, who did

              11  you report to?

              12          A.   Jennifer Haaser, and then -- then

              13  sometimes Jayne Beckstead, but Jennifer Haaser

              14  was my immediate supervisor.

              15          Q.   And then you understood that

              16  Ms. Beckstead was above Ms. Haaser?

              17          A.   And Jayne -- Jayne was above

              18  Jennifer.

              19          Q.   So on and so forth, and that

              20  administrative chain, it ended at Dr. Andrabi,

              21  at various points in time, or you don't know?

              22          A.   I don't know.

              23          Q.   Okay.  I'm not asking you to

              24  speculate.

              25             Now, in terms of the physician



                                                               59


               1  practice, who did you report to?  Prior --

               2  now, let's use the break-up time periods.

               3  During the time period that Dr. Burdine and

               4  Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Brunsting were together,

               5  who did you report to?

               6          A.   The medical director, Dr. Hashmi.

               7          Q.   Now, how -- how did Dr. Hashmi

               8  get the title medical director, to your

               9  knowledge?

              10          A.   You'll have to ask Jayne

              11  Beckstead.

              12          Q.   You just knew he had that title,

              13  correct?

              14          A.   Correct.

              15          Q.   And then when Doctor -- did he

              16  always retain that title, through the times

              17  that you were working for the practice?

              18          A.   Dr. Phillips was going to get it,

              19  or he had it about the time I was leaving.  I

              20  don't remember which one it was.

              21          Q.   And incidentally, when you left,

              22  was it amicable?

              23          A.   Between?

              24          Q.   When you left Mercy?

              25          A.   Amicable with myself and Mercy?



                                                               60


               1          Q.   And Mercy, yes.

               2          A.   I wanted a change.  I didn't

               3  think I was doing as well as what I wanted to.

               4  My heart wasn't in it anymore.  I think it was

               5  -- I think it was my decision to really leave.

               6  I know it was my decision to leave, so I would

               7  say it was agreed upon.

               8          Q.   Essentially, you went on, you got

               9  another job that -- where are you working

              10  today, same job you got post?

              11          A.   I'm working at UTMC.  I'm a

              12  clinical decision data analyst.

              13          Q.   Where did you go after you left

              14  Mercy?

              15          A.   I didn't go anywhere immediately.

              16  I took a break.

              17          Q.   How long did you take off?

              18          A.   Six months.

              19          Q.   And then -- and so then after

              20  your six months, I guess -- I guess vacation

              21  or so, whatever you want to, like to call it,

              22  or -- then you decided to hop back into the

              23  workforce essentially?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   And that's your current job?



                                                               61


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Dr. Phillips had come into

               3  the practice at the time you had left; is that

               4  correct?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   Depending on the witness, some

               7  people -- I don't think Dr. Phillips would

               8  describe himself this way -- but some people

               9  have described him as a bull in a China closet

              10  on some matters.

              11             Do you agree or disagree with that

              12  type of categorization?

              13          A.   I would agree with it.

              14          Q.   From time to time, he could be

              15  like that?

              16          A.   He was very outgoing.

              17          Q.   Was Dr. Holland as outgoing as

              18  Dr. Phillips?

              19          A.   It was different.  Dr. Holland

              20  was angry a lot of times.  Dr. Phillips was

              21  one who just liked to talk.  Dr. Holland

              22  didn't like to talk a lot, but there were a

              23  lot of times when he was very angry.  There is

              24  a difference between bull in a China shop is

              25  -- is not how I would describe Dr. Holland.



                                                               62


               1          Q.   Did you ever get to the point on

               2  a personal level with Dr. Holland to discuss

               3  with him what the frustrations were that were

               4  driving his anger?

               5          A.   I don't think we had that sort of

               6  relationship.

               7          Q.   Do you think that some of his

               8  frustrations or anger, however you'd like to

               9  categorize it, do you feel that sometimes it

              10  spilled over, and you became a recipient of

              11  it, or had to listen to it?

              12          A.   Definitely.

              13          Q.   Did you try to help him resolve

              14  issues, when they would come up?

              15          A.   Some issues, I could help him

              16  with.  Others, I could not.

              17          Q.   Now, hang on one second.  What --

              18  what type of relationship did you have

              19  generally with Adam Carruthers?

              20          A.   I was the practice manager, and

              21  he was the physician assistant.

              22          Q.   Did you get along with him?

              23          A.   I would say we did not get along.

              24          Q.   Did you -- what -- what -- what

              25  would you describe as your basic reasons why



                                                               63


               1  you generally did not get along?

               2          A.   Am I supposed to see that?

               3          Q.   Oh, I'm just asking her to mark

               4  133.

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  Go ahead, I'm

               6  sorry.  Would you like to mark it first?

               7             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 133

               8  was marked for identification.)

               9          A.   So that question is not related

              10  to this?

              11          Q.   It's not related -- well, it sort

              12  of, in a way, because there is -- well, I'll

              13  ask you about Mr. Carruthers in this email in

              14  a second, but -- so they are related, because

              15  it's Mr. Carruthers, but just generally, you

              16  can read the email first, if you'd like.

              17          A.   My relationship with Adam

              18  Carruthers?

              19          Q.   Yes.

              20          A.   It was -- it was a difficult

              21  relationship.

              22          Q.   Did -- did Mr. Carruthers ever

              23  complain to you about a lack of sleep?

              24          A.   Mr. Carruthers complained about

              25  everything.



                                                               64


               1          Q.   Did he complain about having to

               2  work repeated 60-plus hour workweeks?

               3          A.   He complained about that.

               4          Q.   How many hours a week did you

               5  typically work for the practice?

               6          A.   40 hours.

               7          Q.   And you understood he was an

               8  exempt employee, so he wasn't required to be

               9  paid overtime, correct?

              10          A.   Correct.  I believe he got call

              11  hours --

              12          Q.   Uh-huh.

              13          A.   -- paid, I think.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Did you sense a level of

              15  frustration from Mr. Carruthers about the

              16  number of hours he was working?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   And what type of frustrations

              19  would he discuss with you, or say to you about

              20  that?

              21          A.   That he was working too hard and

              22  too long, is what he would say to me.

              23          Q.   Did you see any impact on him

              24  personally, in terms of his personality, or

              25  having a shorter fuse, or anything that would



                                                               65


               1  go along with working too many hours, that you

               2  noticed?

               3          A.   I think his short fuse had

               4  nothing to do with the long hours that he

               5  worked.

               6          Q.   What do you think it had to do

               7  with?  I mean, not -- I don't want you to

               8  speculate or guess.  If you have some

               9  knowledge as to what it would be, please let

              10  me know.

              11          A.   I think that is his personality.

              12  I think Adam is a very difficult person.  He's

              13  a pathological liar.  I had -- I had instances

              14  with him, confrontations with him.  He was my

              15  most difficult employee.

              16          Q.   Had you ever heard any discussion

              17  that he indicated he believed you had gone on

              18  to his computer and looked at files on his

              19  computer?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   Did you ever hear any allegation

              22  that he -- did you ever hear any allegation

              23  that he claimed that you undercut him in the

              24  work environment?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               66


               1          Q.   And in terms of being a practice

               2  manager with the physician's assistant, what

               3  was your role in terms of having to deal with

               4  him day to day?  I mean, I understand the

               5  personality issue, but in terms of management,

               6  or -- other than putting up with him, what did

               7  you have to do?

               8          A.   Well, there were communications,

               9  you know, to set up meetings with them, check

              10  to make sure that -- that they had what they

              11  needed for their job, make sure that

              12  communication took place for where they were

              13  going to be.  Where they said that they were

              14  going to be, and where they were sometimes

              15  were different things.  I never went on his

              16  computer.  I'm surprised by the allegation.

              17          Q.   Do you know whether or not at

              18  various points in time Adam Carruthers was

              19  recording conversations with people?

              20          A.   He tried to record a conversation

              21  with me on his phone.

              22          Q.   And how do you know he tried to

              23  do that?

              24          A.   He did it right in front of me.

              25  He said, I'm going to record this.  When I



                                                               67


               1  tried to talk to him about working through our

               2  issues and -- and looking at the big picture,

               3  and he was -- he was very, very paranoid.

               4          Q.   What do you think he was -- when

               5  was this time period that you indicate he was

               6  paranoid?

               7          A.   Not too long after he started.

               8          Q.   When did he start, to your

               9  recollection?

              10          A.   I don't have that down in my

              11  little book.  I don't remember.  It was, what,

              12  about a year after.  It took some time to get

              13  the PAs hired in.  I don't recall if it was

              14  like a year after we had the practice started,

              15  somewhere.

              16          Q.   So before Dr. Holland arrived?

              17          A.   Definitely.

              18          Q.   Okay.  So before Dr. Holland even

              19  arrived, Adam Carruthers had tried to tape

              20  record a conversation?

              21          A.   The time that I remember, it was

              22  afterwards that he tried to tape my

              23  conversation.

              24          Q.   It was after Dr. Holland had

              25  arrived?



                                                               68


               1          A.   It was after Dr. Holland.  It had

               2  nothing to do with Dr. Holland, though.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Do you know whether or not

               4  Doctor -- Adam Carruthers was recording

               5  conversations with you without holding a phone

               6  up, instead he was concealing it?

               7          A.   How would I know?

               8          Q.   I'm just wondering if you had any

               9  indication?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Had you ever heard that there

              12  were, anybody in Mercy that was recording

              13  conversations?

              14          A.   No.

              15          Q.   Had you ever heard whether or not

              16  Dr. Holland was recording any conversations?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Now, in Exhibit 4058, there is a,

              19  this is an email -- I'm sorry, Exhibit 133,

              20  which is MSV 4058.

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   There is an email from you to

              23  Jayne Beckstead, and it's talking about Adam.

              24          A.   Hmm.

              25          Q.   And do you recall this, any facts



                                                               69


               1  surrounding the portion where it says, so I

               2  believe that Adam has misrepresented his

               3  opportunities and is seeking a substantial pay

               4  raise?

               5          A.   Oh, Adam was playing games.  He

               6  was trying to get more money, so he was

               7  contacting people over at St. Anne's, in order

               8  to get a job over there, or have a position

               9  created, or something like that.

              10          Q.   Do you recall ever being told or

              11  hearing that Adam wanted to go work full-time

              12  for Dr. Holland at St. Anne's?

              13          A.   Yes, I believe I heard that.

              14          Q.   And how do you recall hearing

              15  that?

              16          A.   I think Adam told me that's what

              17  he would like to do.

              18          Q.   Did you have any reason -- strike

              19  that.

              20             Did you see anything wrong with

              21  that?

              22          A.   I didn't see the benefit of that,

              23  because our other -- our doctors needed him.

              24  There is nothing we could do to stop him, of

              25  course, from applying for a job to work for



                                                               70


               1  Dr. Holland full-time, but you know, I was

               2  kind of hoping that he would stay and work

               3  with all three doctors, as opposed to just,

               4  you know, taking off.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Did you think he had a

               6  good relationship with Dr. Holland?

               7          A.   I think he had an excellent

               8  relationship with Dr. Holland.

               9          Q.   In terms of -- leaving aside

              10  personality, in terms of Mr. Carruthers'

              11  skill, you had indicated you would like to see

              12  him work with all three doctors.

              13          A.   Because of his skill set.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              15             Had you ever been told, by any

              16  source, that Dr. Holland made any complaints

              17  about you to management or administration at

              18  the hospital?

              19          A.   Say again.

              20          Q.   Had you ever been told that

              21  Dr. Holland made any complaints about you to

              22  the administration of the hospital?

              23          A.   I think I heard that.

              24          Q.   And where did you hear that from?

              25          A.   I don't remember.



                                                               71


               1          Q.   Do you recall anything else

               2  surrounding it, in terms of what the

               3  complaints were about?

               4          A.   He had a meeting with himself, I

               5  think Dr. Hashmi, and Dr. Phillips, and Jayne

               6  Beckstead.  And I don't know who else was at

               7  the meeting.  This is all hearsay.  This is

               8  all from what I heard, and he was complaining

               9  about me as a manager.

              10          Q.   If you can -- anything else you

              11  can recall, or just it was more general,

              12  general as you're sort of --

              13          A.   Well, I wasn't in on the meeting,

              14  and it was hearsay, so I don't know anything

              15  else that I can tell you.

              16          Q.   You and Doc -- you had indicated

              17  before you had a number of conversations with

              18  Dr. Holland, when you had disagreements with

              19  each other; is that right?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   So is it fair to say that there

              22  were times you complained directly to him

              23  about him, and that he complained to you about

              24  you?

              25          A.   I would say that's fair.



                                                               72


               1          Q.   Exhibit -- next exhibit in the

               2  binder is 54.  I would like you to look at.

               3          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

               4          Q.   And there is a memo, where you

               5  have an attachment, Dr. Holland communication

               6  issues.  And this is dated November 5, 2014.

               7  Do you see that?

               8          A.   I do.

               9          Q.   And you have written this to

              10  Dr. Hashmi, correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   And you documented three

              13  instances here on the next page with regard to

              14  communication issues and Dr. Holland, correct?

              15          A.   Correct.

              16          Q.   Now, I will represent to you that

              17  we do not have any further memos from you

              18  documenting additional ones over time.  Would

              19  that seem to indicate to you that therefore

              20  you -- well, strike that.

              21             Did there come a point in time when

              22  you stopped documenting issues, or is it just

              23  that there was no need to, because issues were

              24  worked through?  If you can explain, please

              25  do.



                                                               73


               1          A.   When I see a pattern, I bring it

               2  to the attention of my superior.  If this only

               3  happened once, then -- then I -- there were

               4  more instances than this that occurred.  But

               5  then there was a pattern, and it kept getting

               6  worse, the situations kept getting worse.  It

               7  wasn't just a matter of him not responding to

               8  us.  It became a very serious matter,

               9  when in this last one here, we had a patient

              10  that could have died, Dr. Holland, and you

              11  didn't make yourself available.  And I don't

              12  understand how you can do that.  I am so angry

              13  about that, Dr. Holland.  How can you --

              14  (pounding fist) -- how can you do that?  How

              15  can you do that?  Make yourself unavailable

              16  for patient care?  You tell me.

              17          Q.   And --

              18          A.   You tell me as a doctor how you

              19  can live with making yourself unavailable for

              20  a patient who needs your care.  It's one thing

              21  to not answer our questions, because for some

              22  reason, God knows, but when you're on call,

              23  and we expect to be able to reach you in case

              24  of an emergency, and you make yourself

              25  unavailable, you tell me how it is that you



                                                               74


               1  can live with that?  That is my answer.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Now, so your testimony is

               3  that over the years you worked with

               4  Dr. Hashmi, you never saw an instance of him

               5  being unavailable to perform a surgery?

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   And how many times did you, in

               8  the times that you were managing the office,

               9  observe Dr. Hashmi having to swap out nursing

              10  shifts, because a procedure was taking so

              11  long?

              12          A.   I'm not familiar with that,

              13  because I worked in the office, and not over

              14  at the hospital.

              15          Q.   Were you --

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Object to that

              17  question on the foundation.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Were you

              19  aware, ma'am, that Dr. Hashmi's mitral valve

              20  death statistic in the year 2012, prior to

              21  Dr. Holland coming, was 50 percent of his

              22  patients?  Were you aware of that?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  We'll object to that

              24  for foundation and for form.

              25          A.   You're throwing out a



                                                               75


               1  percentage --

               2          Q.   Yes.

               3          A.   -- but you haven't given me the

               4  numerator or a denominator.

               5          Q.   I'm asking you whether or not you

               6  knew, at any point in time in your tenure at

               7  the institution, about all the deaths that

               8  were occurring with Dr. Hashmi?

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, same

              10  objection, form and foundation.

              11          A.   I don't understand --

              12          Q.   Okay.

              13          A.   -- the question.

              14          Q.   You said your -- your -- you

              15  identify patterns?

              16          A.   I identified patterns when there

              17  were problems in the office, yes.

              18          Q.   Did you ever identify a pattern,

              19  when two patients back to back, in the year

              20  2013, within 48 hours of each other, both died

              21  after minimally invasive surgery performed by

              22  Dr. Hashmi, did you ever identify a pattern

              23  with that?

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection, form

              25  and foundation.



                                                               76


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   How about in December of 2000 --

               3  when did you leave?  You left in February of

               4  2017, correct?

               5          A.   '16.

               6          Q.   '16.  Do you recall patterns of

               7  Dr. Hashmi's patients having to return to the

               8  OR, because they were bleeding?

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection, form

              10  and foundation.

              11          A.   All that information is readily

              12  available and documented, and it is also

              13  discussed at M & M conferences.

              14          Q.   How often did you pull the STS

              15  data for people?

              16          A.   Marsha Horner is in charge of the

              17  STS database.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Well, how often did you

              19  pull it?

              20          A.   Those reports went directly to

              21  the doctors.  Marsha provided those reports to

              22  the doctors and to administration.  She'll

              23  have to answer that question for you.

              24          Q.   Well, didn't you obtain STS data

              25  for Dr. Holland, at least one time?



                                                               77


               1          A.   If I asked -- if someone had

               2  asked me to obtain it, then I would have

               3  obtained it.

               4          Q.   And so am I correct then that

               5  during the times that you were working at

               6  Mercy, you never heard, in your presence, any

               7  discussion about any quality concerns when it

               8  came to Dr. Hashmi?

               9          A.   Those were -- quality concerns

              10  about Dr. Hashmi?  No.

              11          Q.   Okay.  So to be clear,

              12  Dr. Phillips, who you said, from time to time,

              13  you agreed he could be a bull in a China

              14  closet and talk a lot, you never heard him

              15  vocalizing that he had quality concerns about

              16  Dr. Hashmi?

              17          A.   I think he would address that

              18  with administration and not with me.

              19          Q.   You never heard him, in your

              20  presence, ever once, saying anything about

              21  Dr. Hashmi and quality?

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, asked and

              23  answered.  You can -- you can answer.

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Do you know whether or not, have



                                                               78


               1  you ever been told, or ever heard, whether or

               2  not any patients died at Mercy, because Mercy

               3  -- because Dr. Hashmi indicated he was too

               4  tired to perform a procedure?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

               6          A.   I never heard that.

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form and

               8  foundation.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Can you please

              10  turn to Exhibit 64?

              11          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              12          Q.   And the second part, the second

              13  page appears to be wRV, or RVU statistics.  Do

              14  you see that?

              15          A.   I do.

              16          Q.   Ms. Haaser was sending that to

              17  you on January 16th, 2015?

              18          A.   Dr. Hashmi's requested the RVUs.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And then in terms of the

              20  email that is here, I'm not going to ask you

              21  to read all the content, but you have not seen

              22  that email before today, correct?

              23          A.   This email here?

              24          Q.   Yes, from Dr. Hashmi to Michele?

              25          A.   I have seen it before today.



                                                               79


               1          Q.   Where did you see it?

               2          A.   In the emails that I read before

               3  this deposition.

               4          Q.   I see.  So you were aware then of

               5  Dr. Hashmi discussing with people issues

               6  pertaining to his contract and wRVUs; is that

               7  right?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And when did Dr. Hashmi --

              10  I mean, what conversations do you recall

              11  Dr. Hashmi ever having, complaining that his

              12  contract was set up as one that paid him based

              13  upon his wRVUs, and he didn't like the fact

              14  that people were cannibalizing that, every

              15  time another surgeon got one, he didn't get

              16  the credit he thought he should get?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              18  narrative.

              19          A.   I don't agree with that

              20  statement.

              21          Q.   You never had a conversation with

              22  Dr. Hashmi, where he ever made, in your

              23  presence, complained that he had a wRVU

              24  contract, and that because Dr. Holland, or

              25  other physicians were there, he couldn't make



                                                               80


               1  his bonus and that bothered him?

               2          A.   He never discussed it with me.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Were you aware that that

               4  would happen, if he didn't get enough

               5  referrals or enough cases?

               6          A.   I didn't know.

               7          Q.   How many times were you ever made

               8  aware that Dr. Hashmi, after a procedure

               9  began, recoded it such that he added un --

              10  unplanned procedures to the coding?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Or is that an

              13  area you wouldn't be involved in with the

              14  codings on procedures?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              16  foundation.

              17          A.   I find that a difficult question.

              18  Explain it to me what it is that you're

              19  saying.

              20          Q.   Sure.  Person comes in -- you

              21  know what a planned procedure versus a

              22  performed procedure is?

              23          A.   Uh-huh.

              24          Q.   Yes?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               81


               1          Q.   Okay.  And how many times did you

               2  see it with Dr. Hashmi that a patient came in

               3  for a planned procedure, but instead had

               4  something different performed -- performed?

               5          A.   That happens in surgery.  Until a

               6  surgeon gets in there, they don't know what

               7  they're really dealing with sometimes.  So I

               8  mean, like a surgeon can schedule for a three

               9  CABG, for a three bypass, but let's say they

              10  get in there and they say, oh, well, no, he

              11  needs to have a little bit more.  You have to

              12  get in there and actually see what the

              13  situation is, so it is always tentative what

              14  it is that you schedule for surgery, until the

              15  surgeon gets in there.

              16          Q.   Did you ever see any -- did you

              17  ever notice any pattern with Dr. Hashmi, where

              18  he would state that he had a planned

              19  procedure, but instead he would have a

              20  different performed procedure?

              21          A.   I saw no pattern there.

              22          Q.   And did you ever hear any, or did

              23  you ever hear any discussion in your presence

              24  about whether or not by performing additional

              25  procedures, in addition to the planned



                                                               82


               1  procedure, Dr. Hashmi increased his RVU count?

               2          A.   No.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

               4  foundation.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) If you could

               6  turn to the next exhibit, Exhibit 65, please.

               7          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  2015.

               8  Okay.

               9          Q.   Now, this is a conversation

              10  between yourself and Danielle Collins; is that

              11  correct?

              12          A.   It looks like it.

              13          Q.   And what type of conversation was

              14  this?

              15          A.   It looks like an email

              16  conversation.

              17          Q.   Did you have some kind of ability

              18  to chat through Mercy, a chat log or

              19  something?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Did you use that from time to

              22  time?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   To talk to people?

              25          A.   (Witness nods head.)



                                                               83


               1          Q.   Yes, you did?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   It's different than the email

               4  system; is that right?

               5          A.   It is different than the email.

               6          Q.   And February 10, 2015, you write

               7  to Danielle Collins, and also yourself, or at

               8  least -- I'm sorry, strike that.

               9             This is a document, it appears,

              10  from you to Danielle Collins and yourself,

              11  with an attachment.  And the first one is --

              12  appears from you at 9:50 a.m.

              13             Danielle, do not mention us

              14  replacing Dr. Holland.  We do not want that to

              15  be heard or get out.

              16             Danielle Collins writes back at

              17  9:51 a.m., I won't.  That's why I wanted to

              18  ask you privately.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Now, do you recall who

              21  told you that they wanted to get rid of

              22  Dr. Holland -- no, strike that.

              23             You say we here, correct?

              24          A.   Correct.

              25          Q.   Okay.  So who is we?



                                                               84


               1          A.   The practice.

               2          Q.   And at that point in time, the

               3  practice was comprised of who?

               4          A.   Would have been -- would have

               5  been Dr. Phillips, Dr. Hashmi, Dr. Holland.

               6  Well, Dr. Holland's at Toledo Clinic.  Doctor

               7  -- so I guess Dr. Phillips and Dr. Hashmi.

               8          Q.   Well, I'll represent to you that

               9  -- just -- correct.  Let me look at something

              10  on a timeline real quick.

              11             I'll represent to you that

              12  Dr. Phillips did not arrive until

              13  approximately May of 2015.  So with that in

              14  mind, and that this is February of 2015, the

              15  practice group, at that point in time, would

              16  have been comprised of who, to your knowledge?

              17          A.   I don't -- I guess I just assumed

              18  Phillips was already there.

              19          Q.   Okay.

              20          A.   Okay?  I could be wrong, but

              21  Brunsting wasn't there.  You came to replace

              22  Brunsting, so it was -- it was Burdine, as far

              23  as I know.  I don't remember when he got sick.

              24  Burdine and Hashmi.

              25          Q.   So you think Dr. Burdine wanted



                                                               85


               1  Dr. Holland to leave?

               2          A.   I don't know.

               3          Q.   Well, isn't it true that the

               4  person who wanted to get rid of Dr. Holland

               5  was Dr. Hashmi, right?

               6          A.   I think that there were several

               7  people that would have liked to see that

               8  service agreement disbanded.

               9          Q.   Okay.  So I asked you about

              10  Dr. Hashmi.  Dr. Hashmi wanted to see it

              11  disbanded, correct?

              12          A.   You'll have to ask him.

              13          Q.   No.  I'm asking you what you

              14  know.

              15          A.   I know that I wanted to see it

              16  disbanded.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Well, I didn't ask you

              18  about you.

              19          A.   Uh-huh.

              20          Q.   I asked you about Dr. Hashmi.

              21  Did you know that he wanted to see it

              22  disbanded?

              23          A.   I don't know.

              24          Q.   By the way, did you tell

              25  Dr. Holland at any point in time you wanted to



                                                               86


               1  see his agreement disbanded?

               2          A.   No.  We didn't -- we weren't

               3  speaking very -- we weren't that congenial.

               4          Q.   Did you tell anyone, other than

               5  Ms. Collins, you wanted to see his agreement

               6  disbanded?

               7          A.   I'm sure I told a few people.

               8          Q.   But, of course, you did nothing

               9  in -- within your power to try to cause that

              10  to happen by subverting him in any way,

              11  correct?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              13          A.   I would not --

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Go ahead.

              15          A.   I'm a professional.  I wouldn't

              16  do that.

              17          Q.   So despite that anger you flashed

              18  earlier today at Dr. Holland, and that emotion

              19  --

              20          A.   Uh-huh.

              21          Q.   -- that you flashed, after that

              22  experience, you put that all behind you so you

              23  could work with him professionally?

              24          A.   You have to put a hold on your

              25  emotions sometimes and work professionally.



                                                               87


               1          Q.   So in addition to yourself, did

               2  Doctor -- was Dr. Hashmi one of the people

               3  that expressed to you he wanted to have the

               4  service agreement terminated?

               5          A.   I don't know.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Who else did, other than

               7  you?

               8          A.   There were a lot of people that

               9  would have liked to have seen Dr. Holland's

              10  service agreement disbanded.  I'm talking

              11  front office people, I'm talking -- I'm

              12  talking myself.

              13          Q.   And what did Dr. Hashmi -- you

              14  talked to Dr. Hashmi about it, obviously,

              15  right?

              16          A.   I did talk with Dr. Hashmi and

              17  Dr. Burdine.  And I expressed the way that I

              18  felt about things.

              19          Q.   What did you -- what did Doctor

              20  -- did Dr. Hashmi tell you that he was going

              21  to work to replace Dr. Holland?

              22          A.   Work to replace Dr. Holland?

              23          Q.   Yes.

              24          A.   In what way?

              25          Q.   Well, in your text message, you



                                                               88


               1  talk about, do not mention us replacing

               2  Dr. Holland.  I'm presuming you're not talking

               3  about Ms. Collins, right?  She's not the one

               4  trying to replace Dr. Holland, correct?

               5          A.   Right.  She's not the -- she

               6  didn't have the power.  She was, you know, she

               7  was part of our practice.

               8          Q.   And you didn't have the power

               9  either, at least --

              10          A.   I didn't.

              11          Q.   -- within your direct power,

              12  correct?

              13          A.   Correct.

              14          Q.   Now, whose is the us replacing

              15  Dr. Holland?

              16          A.   The practice.

              17          Q.   Okay.  The practice is Hashmi and

              18  Burdine?

              19          A.   Hashmi and Burdine.

              20          Q.   So you think Burdine is included

              21  in wanting to replace Dr. Holland?

              22          A.   I can't ask him.

              23          Q.   Well, did you ever, before

              24  writing this text?

              25          A.   It's unclear to me as to whether



                                                               89


               1  or not it was Dr. Burdine and Dr. Hashmi and

               2  myself.

               3          Q.   Or if it was just you and

               4  Dr. Hashmi?

               5          A.   I don't remember.

               6          Q.   Why didn't you want it to be

               7  heard or get out that was what was being

               8  plotted?

               9          A.   I think plotted is not the

              10  correct word.

              11          Q.   Well, what word would you prefer

              12  to use?  What synonym of plotted would you

              13  like to use?

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to the

              15  word.

              16          A.   I would provide documentation

              17  that would give us grounds for ending the

              18  service agreement and his affiliation with us.

              19  That was part of my job.

              20          Q.   And who gave you that job duty?

              21          A.   Doctor -- the medical director,

              22  Dr. Hashmi.

              23          Q.   Dr. Hashmi.  Okay.  So who was it

              24  that said we do not want your discussions to

              25  get out or be heard, or you don't remember?



                                                               90


               1          A.   That was me who said it.

               2          Q.   Okay.  But it wasn't just you

               3  that didn't want it to get out, right?

               4          A.   I would say it wasn't just me.

               5          Q.   Why didn't you want it to get

               6  out?

               7          A.   I think just because you -- if

               8  you're in a practice, you don't want a whole

               9  lot of people to know that there are a lot of

              10  -- that there are problems within the

              11  practice.  Dr. Holland was one of the

              12  problems.  You try to keep that self -- you

              13  try to keep that stuff confidential within a

              14  practice.  And hospitals are tremendously

              15  known for gossip.

              16          Q.   They're also known for secrets as

              17  well, aren't they?

              18          A.   If you watch the TV shows, yes.

              19          Q.   You read the newspapers as well.

              20          A.   Hmm.

              21          Q.   Exhibit 66 in the binder, please.

              22          A.   Uh-huh.

              23          Q.   Oh, incidentally, do you recall

              24  Dr. Hashmi asking you to obtain Dr. Holland's

              25  contract, so that he could review it?



                                                               91


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   And do you recall that Dr. Hashmi

               3  wanted to look at the -- the termination

               4  provisions in it?

               5          A.   He wanted that, because he was

               6  interviewing candidates, and the candidates

               7  might have questions, so he wanted to be

               8  prepared to answer those questions, so he

               9  needed some sort of referral on that.

              10             I sent that request to either

              11  Jennifer or Jayne Beckstead.  And I think

              12  their response was, no, he couldn't look at

              13  the contract, so that was the end of it.

              14          Q.   If you can just review Exhibit 66

              15  for a minute, and then I have some questions.

              16          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  Okay.

              17          Q.   Appears Ms. Haaser, on

              18  February 19th, 2015, is writing an email to

              19  Dr. Hashmi, and then also a cc to you, meeting

              20  follow-up.  Do you see that?

              21          A.   I do.

              22          Q.   And do you see where there is a

              23  mention about RVUs and an amendment to his

              24  contract, Dr. Hashmi's contract?

              25          A.   I do.



                                                               92


               1          Q.   And that Dr. Hashmi's RVUs will

               2  not be bundled in with Dr. Phillips?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Now, above that -- now,

               5  you know that -- presuming that I'm accurate,

               6  that Dr. Phillips comes in in approximately

               7  May of 2015, okay, with that time frame in

               8  mind.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   Did you have a belief that

              11  Dr. Phillips was being brought in to replace

              12  Dr. Holland?  And if you did have that belief,

              13  what was the source of it?

              14          A.   No.  I didn't believe that he was

              15  -- he had come in to replace Dr. Holland.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Now, at the top, you write

              17  an email, February 20, 2015, from yourself to

              18  Dr. Hashmi.

              19          A.   Uh-huh.

              20          Q.   Meeting follow-up.  Thank you for

              21  your heads up.  Who is to officially inform

              22  Dr. Holland of his release?

              23          A.   Uh-huh.

              24          Q.   Do you see that you have written

              25  that?



                                                               93


               1          A.   I do.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And in the bottom email,

               3  though, that was below it, there doesn't seem

               4  to be anything in it that talks about

               5  releasing Dr. Holland, correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   Okay.  So what made you believe

               8  that Dr. Holland was being released in or

               9  about February of 2015?

              10          A.   I'm trying to figure out to get a

              11  start date for Alex.  I'm trying to figure out

              12  who Alex is.  Who is Alex?

              13          Q.   I don't know who Alex is.  I see

              14  an email.  Tom has reached out to get a start

              15  date for Alex.

              16          A.   Right.

              17          Q.   The date on this email is

              18  February 20th, 2015.  There is a date right on

              19  it.

              20          A.   Uh-huh, right.

              21          Q.   You wrote an email to Dr. Hashmi

              22  saying, thank you for the heads up.  Who is to

              23  officially inform Dr. Holland of his release?

              24             And we just looked at a prior text

              25  message between you and Ms. Collins from 10



                                                               94


               1  days earlier, where you didn't want people --

               2  you didn't want it to get out about replacing

               3  Dr. Holland.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   So now I'm asking you questions

               6  about, well, who is it that told you that

               7  Dr. Holland was being released?

               8          A.   It had to have been Hashmi or

               9  Jennifer.  It had to be one of the two.

              10          Q.   And did you have any

              11  understanding, any further discussion or

              12  understanding, beyond just that simple fact,

              13  that you knew that it might come from one of

              14  those two?

              15          A.   Do I have a simple understanding

              16  of -- please repeat.

              17          Q.   Yeah.  Did they discuss with you

              18  the reason that he was going to be released?

              19          A.   Not the specific reason.  I just

              20  assumed it was accumulation of all the events

              21  that occurred.

              22          Q.   But he was not released at that

              23  time period, correct?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   And then you didn't create any



                                                               95


               1  more memos about failure of communication with

               2  Dr. Holland?  To -- to your knowledge, you

               3  didn't create any further memos like the one

               4  we saw earlier, correct?

               5          A.   I don't know if I did or not, to

               6  tell you the truth.

               7          Q.   Okay.  You wouldn't have created

               8  one, and then destroyed it before leaving?

               9  You would have left your papers behind or what

              10  have you, correct?

              11          A.   That is the right thing to do,

              12  absolutely.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And you were not involved

              14  in producing the documents here, correct?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Now, Exhibit 69, please, if you

              17  can look at that.

              18          A.   (Doing as indicated.)  So what is

              19  this?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to

              21  foundation.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) What this is

              23  is a -- is a text message from Dr. Hashmi on

              24  or about July 31, 2015 to Dr. Holland.

              25          A.   I don't -- I don't see those



                                                               96


               1  dates.  I see June 15th.

               2          Q.   You can see July 31st, 2015.

               3          A.   Oh, it's there.

               4          Q.   Oh, I'm sorry, no.  No.  You're

               5  right.  I apologize.  You'll see a print date,

               6  it looks like, of 7/31/2015 for identification

               7  purposes.

               8             There is a Hashmi response dated

               9  June 15th.  Then there is a stamp, received

              10  August 5, 2015.

              11          A.   Okay.

              12          Q.   Okay?  Now, and then there is a

              13  -- the Hashmi response is, You are right about

              14  level of care.  It is patchy at best.

              15             So this is from rough, June of

              16  2015.  Okay?  You've not seen this before

              17  today, correct?

              18          A.   I have not.

              19          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall in or about

              20  June of 2015, Dr. Hashmi saying anything to

              21  you about nursing care being patchy at best?

              22          A.   Nursing care?

              23          Q.   Yes.

              24          A.   From whom?

              25          Q.   The support, nursing support,



                                                               97


               1  because there had been a lot of turnover.  Do

               2  you recall there being periods, where there

               3  was a lot of turnover with nurses, and there

               4  was some inconsistency or issues with nursing

               5  care?

               6          A.   At the hospital?

               7          Q.   Yes.

               8          A.   Again, I wasn't in charge at the

               9  hospital, and I don't remember him saying

              10  that.  But you know, I don't know about

              11  nursing turnover at the hospital.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              13             Next exhibit we're going to

              14  encounter is in the second binder, and this is

              15  going to be exhibit -- wait.  You know what,

              16  before we move on, let me just -- here you go.

              17             Exhibit 70, before we move on, that

              18  way we can just use that binder.  Let's finish

              19  up with this binder.  I'm going to take it out

              20  of sequence.  Let's use Exhibit 70.

              21          A.   70.

              22          Q.   And then we'll go to the other

              23  binder.

              24          A.   Okay.  Okay.

              25          Q.   You're carbon copied on this



                                                               98


               1  August 4, 2015 email from Christopher Phillips

               2  to a number of people, correct?

               3          A.   Correct.

               4          Q.   To Marsha Horner.  And she's the

               5  person you indicated would be the STS data

               6  person, correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   Okay.  And then Dr. Phillips is

               9  thanking her for providing data to him.  Do

              10  you see that?

              11          A.   I do.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Now, do you recall

              13  anything surrounding this time period in terms

              14  of Dr. Phillips doing a review of the quality,

              15  or an overview of the practice generally?  Or

              16  -- or did he not involve you in that, or talk

              17  to you about that?

              18          A.   He didn't talk to me about that.

              19  He came in, and then he would -- came in as

              20  the medical director around this time, I'm --

              21  I'm thinking.  Okay.  And so he would have

              22  wanted to review this sort of thing.  Where he

              23  took it after he reviewed it, I'm not sure if

              24  he spoke to Jennifer Haaser, or Jayne

              25  Beckstead, or the doctors.  I'm not sure where



                                                               99


               1  the conversation went after that.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

               3             If we can move on to the next

               4  binder, and you can turn to Exhibit 79.

               5          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  79?

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Yes.

               8          A.   PQRS records.  Okay.  What

               9  question do you have about these reports?

              10          Q.   Well, this is dated, you'll see

              11  an email, appears from sts@dcri.duke.edu to

              12  you, correct?

              13          A.   Correct.

              14          Q.   And this is providing an STS 2014

              15  surgeon PQRS data quality report for Fred W.

              16  Holland; is that right?

              17          A.   Is this for -- oh, I see.  Okay.

              18  Yes, for Dr. Holland, correct.

              19          Q.   Now, how is it that you

              20  understand that you came to obtain this

              21  document?  Why was it sent to you, if you can

              22  recall?

              23          A.   Because I helped with PQRS data.

              24  That's different than the quality data.  I

              25  helped submit those reports.



                                                               100


               1          Q.   You didn't -- you did not -- you

               2  were not involved with the M & M conferences,

               3  correct?

               4          A.   Correct.

               5          Q.   Now, in terms of the STS data as

               6  -- well, this is a part of STS data, do you

               7  understand that?

               8          A.   It is part of the STS data.  It's

               9  different than -- than the bulk of it.  This

              10  is more for financial stuff.

              11          Q.   All right.  Now, with regard to

              12  the other type of STS data that has the

              13  statistics, and -- have you seen that type of

              14  STS data before?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   And where have you seen that?

              17          A.   Well, usually Marsha would get

              18  it.  She was in charge of it.  And then she

              19  would -- sometimes it would be in paper form,

              20  and sometimes it would be in electronic form.

              21  And then we should get those reports quarterly

              22  and annually.

              23          Q.   And those would then be

              24  distributed to the individual physicians?

              25          A.   It should have been distributed



                                                               101


               1  definitely to the medical director and to

               2  myself.  And I'm not sure how it was dispersed

               3  after that.

               4          Q.   So when you say medical director,

               5  before Dr. Phillips came in, that data would

               6  have been distributed to Dr. Hashmi, correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   And then when Dr. Phillips came

               9  in and took on that title, then he would have

              10  been distributed that data, correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   And you would have seen it, from

              13  time to time, in paper form, but it was Marsha

              14  Horner that was responsible ultimately for

              15  taking care of that, correct?

              16          A.   Absolutely.

              17          Q.   All right.  Moving on pretty well

              18  here.  Exhibit 134.

              19             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 134

              20  was marked for identification.)

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   This is an email from

              23  Adam Middleton, dated December 1st, 2015 to

              24  you.  Do you see that?

              25          A.   I do.



                                                               102


               1          Q.   Okay.  And do you recall, prior

               2  to December of 2015, ever having any

               3  interactions with Mr. Middleton?

               4          A.   Over the course, you know, there

               5  were different consultants that came in to

               6  help improve the whole strategy for the

               7  practice, so I don't remember if this is the

               8  first or not with Adam Middleton.

               9          Q.   You recall Mr. Middleton more

              10  than one occasion, you just can't remember

              11  exactly the specifics of each time?

              12          A.   Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he set up a

              13  couple of different meetings with the docs, so

              14  ....

              15          Q.   Now, this exhibit refers to

              16  meetings being set up in December of 2015.  Do

              17  you recall assisting in setting up meetings

              18  with Mr. Middleton and Dr. Hashmi, Holland

              19  and/or Phillips?

              20          A.   I usually took care of Dr. Hashmi

              21  and Dr. Phillips' calendar.  And then

              22  Dr. Holland would let me know if he was

              23  available for the meetings.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Do you know what the

              25  purpose was of the meetings that were going to



                                                               103


               1  be held in December of 2015?

               2          A.   I thought that it was for

               3  strategy and marketing, and you know, stuff

               4  like that.

               5          Q.   Did you believe that one of the

               6  reasons that Mr. Middleton had been -- strike

               7  that.

               8             Without speculating or guessing --

               9          A.   I am.

              10          Q.   -- the next question I'm saying,

              11  without speculating or guessing, do you know

              12  whether or not one of the reasons

              13  Mr. Middleton was brought in was to try to

              14  create more synergy between the surgeons?

              15          A.   I don't know that.  I didn't sit

              16  in on the meetings, so I don't know.

              17          Q.   Were you ever informed that

              18  subsequent to these meetings, that

              19  Dr. Phillips was put on -- placed on

              20  probation?

              21          A.   Before these meetings, he was

              22  placed on probation?

              23          Q.   You believe it was before these

              24  meetings or after?

              25          A.   I remember before I left, now



                                                               104


               1  that was months after that.

               2          Q.   You left in approximately

               3  February of 2016, correct?

               4          A.   '16, but this is '15.

               5          Q.   Correct.  This is December of

               6  2015.

               7          A.   Right.

               8          Q.   Do you remember in that time

               9  period Dr. Phillips being placed on probation?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Do you ever remember him ever

              12  being placed on probation --

              13          A.   He --

              14          Q.   -- or being told?

              15          A.   He talked to me about something

              16  before I left.

              17          Q.   Do you recall what he said?

              18          A.   Right before.  I'm trying to --

              19  I'm trying to remember.  No.

              20          Q.   Did you ever go to any -- strike

              21  that.

              22             Did you ever have any social

              23  interactions with Dr. Hashmi outside of the

              24  workplace --

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               105


               1          Q.   -- in terms of being -- okay.

               2  And what types of interactions would you have

               3  with him outside the workplace?

               4          A.   It was only a couple of times,

               5  like his daughter was getting married, so the

               6  ladies in the office were, and -- and the

               7  other doctors were invited to his house for

               8  his daughter's, you know, shower.  We were

               9  invited to his daughter's wedding, but we

              10  couldn't make it.  But it was -- it was all

              11  the ladies in the office, all the employees in

              12  the office, including the PAs and the doctors.

              13  So we're talking that, we're talking

              14  Christmas, and that was about it.

              15          Q.   Did you believe that Dr. Holland

              16  was ever invited by Dr. Hashmi to his house or

              17  to any parties?

              18          A.   I don't know.

              19          Q.   Did Adam Carruthers ever discuss

              20  with you any -- at any point in time -- strike

              21  that.

              22             Did Adam Carruthers ever relay to

              23  you that surgeons had been complaining to him

              24  about the pattern of referrals?  Or words to

              25  that effect.



                                                               106


               1          A.   He complained about a lot of

               2  things, and I think that was one of them.

               3          Q.   Do you recall what, if anything,

               4  he said about them?

               5          A.   That Dr. Holland was not getting

               6  -- he didn't feel like he was getting the

               7  referrals.

               8          Q.   Did he mention anything similar

               9  to you about Dr. Phillips?

              10          A.   No.  At a certain point in time,

              11  Adam stopped speaking with me, so there was a

              12  long period of time where I didn't hear

              13  anything from Ad -- from Adam, but before

              14  that.

              15          Q.   Do you recall when he stopped

              16  speaking to you approximately?

              17          A.   Had to be six months before I

              18  left.

              19          Q.   And do you know why it is that

              20  you stopped speaking to each other?

              21          A.   Yes, I do.

              22          Q.   Or he stopped speaking to you, or

              23  however that worked.

              24          A.   Uh-huh.

              25          Q.   Can you tell me what happened?



                                                               107


               1          A.   I can tell you what happened.

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3          A.   Dr. Phillips was out of town.  He

               4  was a medical center director.  And he was --

               5  the agreement was that PAs could take a day

               6  off, if they had permission by the medical

               7  director, if the medical director was

               8  knowledgeable about it, especially if they had

               9  worked a long weekend.

              10             Adam pretended to be at work, and

              11  he wasn't, and I called him on it.  I told

              12  Phillips this is what's happened.  He's

              13  pretending to be here, but he is not.  Adam

              14  found out about it, because Paul Brown told

              15  him about it.  And from that point on, Adam

              16  refused to speak to me.

              17          Q.   When was it that he wasn't there,

              18  when he said he was?  Was that around

              19  Thanksgiving?  Or do you know when it was?

              20          A.   I -- I don't remember the date

              21  that it occurred.  I just remember Phillips

              22  was out of town at a conference.

              23          Q.   And do you recall what the

              24  reason, if any, was that Mr. Carruthers gave

              25  as to why he was not there?



                                                               108


               1          A.   He wouldn't acknowledge that he

               2  wasn't there.  When -- when Paul told Adam

               3  that I had placed the call, Adam came on in

               4  later on in the day.

               5          Q.   Do you recall whether or not

               6  there was ever an episode, or event, where

               7  Mr. Carruthers was planned to be somewhere

               8  with his family for an event, and someone

               9  scheduled him, and he refused to come in?

              10          A.   I don't know about that.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Let's take a couple minute

              12  break, and I'm probably going to be mostly

              13  done.  I might have some follow-up, but I'm

              14  probably going to be mostly done, and then

              15  we'll turn it over.  Mr. Wiencek may have

              16  questions.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Are you going to go

              19  over her affidavit with her?

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  Oh, I might.  You

              21  know what, why don't we take a break.  Thanks

              22  for pointing it out.  I might.  Thanks.

              24  record.

                                                               109


               1  7:47 until 7:59.)

               4             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 135

               6          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Is that an

               7  affidavit you signed at the request of Mercy?

               8          A.   It is.

               9          Q.   You had a phone interview with

              10  Doctor -- or strike that.

              11             You had a phone interview with

              12  Mr. Wiencek?

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   And who showed you the deposition

              15  pages of Dr. Holland?

              16          A.   Mr. Wiencek.

              17          Q.   And are those the only three

              18  pages you saw, 293, 411 and 451?

              19          A.   I think so.

              20          Q.   There is nothing in this document

              21  using the words race or national origin,

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   Do you recall Doctor -- do you

              25  recall Mr. Wiencek asking you any questions



                                                               110


               1  about race or national origin?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               3  attorney-client privilege.  You don't have to

               4  answer that.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Who prepared

               6  this affidavit?

               7          A.   Mr. Wiencek.

               8          Q.   Did you ever -- did you know a

               9  doctor named Eltaki that worked at the

              10  hospital?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Did you ever hear any reference

              13  to something called the brotherhood?

              14          A.   No.

              15          Q.   Did you ever hear the word mafia

              16  being used at the hospital?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Did you ever hear Dr. Holland

              19  make any complaints about any foreign-born

              20  doctors?

              21             THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry, any

              22  foreign?

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Foreign-born

              24  doctors?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               111


               1          Q.   Did you ever hear anybody, in

               2  your presence, complaining about any

               3  foreign-born doctors?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Did Ms. Haaser, or anybody, ever

               6  advise you that Dr. Holland had ever been

               7  talking about any foreign doctors or

               8  "Muslims"?

               9          A.   I never heard that.

              10          Q.   Did you ever hear whether or not

              11  -- strike that.

              12             Now, this affidavit does not make

              13  -- strike that.

              14             I asked you some questions earlier

              15  today about whether you knew of any system

              16  outside -- strike that.

              17             This affidavit, in paragraph 6 and

              18  7, is what you have described as your

              19  understanding -- strike that.

              20             You're contesting what Dr. Holland

              21  has to say about referrals, correct?  In terms

              22  of what you have written here.

              23          A.   I am contesting it, yes.

              24          Q.   And -- and so according to what

              25  you knew, that if there was a skewed -- skewed



                                                               112


               1  referral pattern, it wasn't anything you were

               2  involved in, correct?

               3          A.   Nothing that I was involved in.

               4          Q.   Now, do you have any idea as to

               5  why it is that -- strike that.

               6             During the time period that

               7  Dr. Burdine was actually performing heart

               8  surgery, do you have any idea as to why

               9  Dr. Burdine was getting so fewer referrals

              10  than Dr. Hashmi, despite the fact that he was

              11  -- they were supposed to get equal referrals?

              12          A.   I wasn't aware that he got fewer

              13  referrals.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, yeah, form

              15  and foundation.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did you think

              17  when Dr. Burdine sent his memo around about

              18  the way the office referrals were supposed to

              19  work, is that he was complaining about the

              20  matter in which they were working?

              21          A.   I think he needed to provide

              22  clarification for the people that were

              23  involved and -- and who the memo was copied

              24  to.

              25          Q.   Did you also -- did you dispute



                                                               113


               1  Dr. Burdine's view of referrals at the

               2  hospital?

               3          A.   Dr. Burdine's -- give me some

               4  clarification on that.

               5          Q.   Yes.  In terms of what

               6  Dr. Burdine saw as the referring patterns, did

               7  you ever argue or fight with Dr. Burdine in

               8  any way about what he said he saw as the

               9  referral patterns?

              10          A.   What do you -- what is it saying

              11  that he saw as the referral patterns?

              12          Q.   I'm just asking, did you have any

              13  discussions with Dr. Burdine about any

              14  referral patterns?

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   And you were never present for

              17  any conversations that Dr. Burdine had with

              18  Doctor -- Mr. Carruthers about referral

              19  patterns, correct?

              20          A.   Correct.

              21          Q.   Were you shown any other

              22  deposition testimony that you can recall?

              23          A.   Just the emails.

              24          Q.   Just certain emails of your --

              25  some of the emails I showed you today, or some



                                                               114


               1  of the ones that you had previously looked at?

               2          A.   Some of them.

               3          Q.   There is other emails that you

               4  looked at as well?

               5          A.   Maybe.

               6          Q.   How were you provided those

               7  documents that you looked at?

               8          A.   Mr. Wiencek provided the emails

               9  to me.

              10          Q.   We had looked earlier with regard

              11  to an email speaking about retirement and

              12  Dr. Holland.  Do you recall -- strike that.

              13             Exhibit 54 is -- is the

              14  documentation email that you had, and we came

              15  to an 11/5/2014 event.

              16          A.   We're looking at Exhibit 54?

              17          Q.   Yes, 54, is your documentation

              18  memo, communication issues.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   And just the question is, do you

              21  know what a left ventricle thrombosis is?

              22          A.   I do.

              23          Q.   What is your understanding as to

              24  what that is?

              25          A.   It's a life-threatening



                                                               115


               1  condition.

               2          Q.   And what makes you think that's

               3  life-threatening condition?

               4          A.   Because it is.

               5          Q.   And is that a condition that is

               6  ordinarily treated surgically?

               7          A.   Emergently.

               8          Q.   Is it ordinarily treated

               9  surgically?

              10          A.   I believe so.

              11          Q.   You believe it is?

              12          A.   I believe it is.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And what leads you to

              14  believe that a right ventricle thrombosis is

              15  ordinarily treated emergently on a surgical

              16  basis?

              17          A.   Because it has been in the past

              18  for the left ventricle.

              19          Q.   And you saw Dr. Hashmi treat it

              20  as such; is that right?

              21          A.   I have seen surgeons treat it as

              22  such.

              23          Q.   What surgeons are you talking

              24  about?

              25          A.   The surgeons both in the prior



                                                               116


               1  practice and the practice for Mercy

               2  Cardiothoracic.

               3          Q.   Now, this patient that's

               4  referenced here on November 5, 2014, was this

               5  patient ever even operated on?

               6          A.   I don't know.

               7          Q.   Would it surprise you to learn

               8  that the patient was not operated on?

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              10  foundation.

              11          A.   Why wasn't the patient operated

              12  on?

              13          Q.   I'm just asking if it would

              14  surprise you to learn that the patient was not

              15  operated on?

              16          A.   I don't know what the

              17  circumstances were by the time the surgeon got

              18  to the patient.

              19          Q.   What do you mean the

              20  circumstances by the time the surgeon got to

              21  the patient?

              22          A.   Well, I -- I documented this, but

              23  what happened afterwards, I don't know.

              24          Q.   You never followed up as the

              25  office manager?



                                                               117


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   You were violently upset about

               3  this, though, but you never bothered to look

               4  into either for one minute afterwards?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to form

               6  and characterization.  You can answer.

               7          A.   I'm sure I did, but I don't

               8  remember what it was.  I'm sure I did, because

               9  I care so much about the patients.

              10             This also is a time thing.  At the

              11  time, it was an emergency situation.

              12          Q.   Do you ever remember seeing PG

              13  comments, or quarterly Press Ganey patient

              14  satisfaction scores with regard to the

              15  practice?

              16          A.   Absolutely.

              17          Q.   And who was it that would send

              18  those around?

              19          A.   I ran those reports.

              20          Q.   And who would you provide them

              21  to?

              22          A.   I would provide them -- it was --

              23  it was total transparency, so I would provide

              24  them to the staff, to my superiors, and to,

              25  you know, the doctors, anyone who wanted to



                                                               118


               1  see it.  Medical director for sure.

               2          Q.   And so when you say medical

               3  director, when it was Dr. Hashmi, to him, and

               4  then also when it was Dr. Phillips, to him,

               5  correct?

               6          A.   Right.

               7          Q.   Now, would those typically be

               8  sent around in emails in writing?

               9          A.   I think what I did do -- well,

              10  for the office staff, I would have weekly

              11  meetings.  And so when Press Ganey came out, I

              12  said, oh, this is great, look at our scores in

              13  this, you guys are doing really well, you

              14  know?  And I thought that I also sent it to

              15  everyone else.  If there were comments,

              16  because you get comments in that, we would

              17  follow up on that, is this good, is this not

              18  good.  We actually had a board in the break

              19  room, said, you know, Press Ganey, you know,

              20  stars and stuff like that.  So it was very

              21  transparent as far as the patient feedback for

              22  our practice, and certainly important for us

              23  to follow up on.

              24          Q.   In Exhibit 101, which is in the

              25  second binder.  It's not an email that's sent



                                                               119


               1  to you, but it's from the time period of April

               2  of 2015.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  So object to

               4  foundation.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Between

               6  Ms. Haaser and Ms. Beckstead.  Do you recall

               7  participating in any way in passing on Press

               8  Ganey patient satisfaction scores to either

               9  Ms. Haaser or Ms. Beckstead in April of 2015?

              10          A.   I -- I did it routinely.

              11          Q.   So you would expect there would

              12  be emails and things, where you were

              13  forwarding these along, right?

              14          A.   Well, either that, or they could

              15  check it directly, so if it wasn't something

              16  that I sent out to them, then they could check

              17  it directly.  They had the, you know,

              18  authority to do that.

              19          Q.   So if there was a pattern of, you

              20  know, if there was a pattern of complaints

              21  from patients about Dr. Holland, or any other

              22  doctor, for that matter, you would tend -- you

              23  would typically -- you would expect to see

              24  them being reported in the quarterly Press

              25  Ganey patient satisfaction?



                                                               120


               1          A.   In the patient comment section,

               2  yes, but it didn't apply just for the doctors.

               3  It would apply to the PAs and to the front

               4  office staff too.  And sometimes even comments

               5  about the nurses on the floor, but we wouldn't

               6  have anything to do with that.

               7          Q.   Okay.  At least as of the time

               8  you left, you knew of no reason or schedule to

               9  destroy those documents, correct?

              10          A.   Those were electronic.

              11          Q.   Do you recall a point in time in

              12  or about -- strike that.

              13             Do you recall -- hmm.  Give me one

              14  second.

              15             Do you recall having any

              16  discussions with Bradley Bertke about

              17  Dr. Holland?

              18          A.   I didn't speak with Dr. Bertke.

              19          Q.   Did you ever speak to Doctor, or

              20  did you ever speak to Mr. Arquilla about

              21  Dr. Holland?

              22          A.   I did not.

              23          Q.   Did you ever speak to Dr. Andrabi

              24  about Doctor -- Dr. Holland?

              25          A.   I did not.



                                                               121


               1          Q.   You -- okay.  Did you ever talk

               2  to anybody at the Toledo Clinic, any of the

               3  administrators there, about Dr. Holland?

               4          A.   In what capacity?

               5          Q.   To make any complaints about him?

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   If Dr. Holland was not an

               8  employee of Mercy, why is it, to your

               9  knowledge, that you were making complaints up

              10  the Mercy chain of command, if you ever

              11  complained about him, as opposed to making

              12  complaints to Toledo Clinic?

              13          A.   That was the only route that I

              14  knew to take.  It -- because I was day-to-day

              15  operations, so I handled the stuff in the

              16  office.  At that level, it would be Jennifer

              17  Haaser, it would be Jayne Beckstead that would

              18  contact Toledo Clinic about that sort of

              19  thing, not me.

              20          Q.   Am I correct that during the time

              21  period that you were running the operations

              22  that -- is it -- strike that.

              23             Did you ever note that Dr. Phillips

              24  received fewer referrals than Dr. Hashmi?

              25          A.   I didn't notice that.



                                                               122


               1          Q.   And you did notice, however, that

               2  Dr. Holland received fewer referrals than

               3  Dr. Hashmi, correct?

               4          A.   He received fewer referrals than

               5  any of the doctors.

               6          Q.   And -- and do you know why it is

               7  that -- did you ever hear that the

               8  cardiologists at St. Anne's preferred

               9  Dr. Holland?  Was that ever communicated to

              10  you?

              11          A.   I never heard that.

              12          Q.   And did you ever hear it stated

              13  to you that Dr. Holland's quality, with regard

              14  to his surgeries, was superior to any other

              15  surgeon at Mercy?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              17  foundation.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) In the

              19  cardiothoracic area?

              20          A.   I definitely didn't hear that.

              21          Q.   Now, did Dr. Hashmi ever tell you

              22  that he was a superior surgeon to Dr. Holland?

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   Did you ever hear anyone

              25  questioning Dr. Holland's surgical skills?



                                                               123


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   You --

               3          A.   Not -- not -- are you talking in

               4  the practice, or you talking outside the

               5  practice?

               6          Q.   I don't know.  Is there a

               7  distinction in your mind?

               8          A.   There is a distinction in my

               9  mind.

              10          Q.   Okay.  What is the distinction to

              11  you?

              12          A.   The distinction is the referral

              13  base, the referring cardiologists.  They're

              14  the ones that give us all those cases.  So if

              15  they had a question about Dr. Holland's

              16  capability, then he wouldn't get the

              17  referrals.

              18          Q.   And who was it, if anyone, that

              19  ever expressed any -- any doctor that ever

              20  expressed to you any reservation or concern

              21  about Dr. Holland's quality as a surgeon?

              22          A.   Dr. Todd Monroe.

              23          Q.   Where is he located at?

              24          A.   He's a cardiologist.  I think it

              25  was with NWOCC.



                                                               124


               1          Q.   Where does he -- where did he

               2  refer his cases, typically?

               3          A.   I don't know.  He worked -- he --

               4  it's a ProMedica practice.

               5          Q.   Well, when did you hear Mr. --

               6  Dr. Monroe say this?

               7          A.   He told me.

               8          Q.   When?

               9          A.   There is -- there is

              10  documentation on it.  There is an email on it.

              11  I would have to --

              12          Q.   This is before you left?

              13          A.   Oh, definitely before I left.

              14          Q.   Okay.  So Dr. Monroe is a

              15  ProMedica doctor, which means that because of

              16  the insurance, the way it's set up, his

              17  referrals went to ProMedica institutions,

              18  correct?

              19          A.   Not necessarily.  Some of the

              20  ProMedica guys would come over to St.

              21  Vincent's and do cases, especially if the

              22  patient's insurance, you know, would be over

              23  at Saint -- would be a Mercy insurance.  So

              24  they had some flexibility there.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Do you ever recall



                                                               125


               1  Todd Monroe ever referring cases to

               2  Dr. Hashmi?

               3          A.   I'm sure he did.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Do you ever recall him

               5  referring cases to Dr. Phillips?

               6          A.   I'm -- I would have to look at

               7  the documentation, but I'm sure he did.  I'd

               8  have to look at the reports.  We kept reports

               9  on that sort of thing.

              10          Q.   And Todd Monroe, how many times

              11  had you ever spoken to Todd Monroe, when he --

              12  when he said anything negative about

              13  Dr. Holland?

              14          A.   Once.  When I --

              15          Q.   What was the context in which

              16  this conversation arose?

              17          A.   He found -- he -- there was a

              18  patient that he referred to our office, and I

              19  think Dr. Holland was on call, so we were

              20  going to give it to Dr. Holland.  Dr. Monroe

              21  found that out.  He was very upset.  He said

              22  none of his patients are to be seen by Dr.

              23  Holland, that he had a history with Dr.

              24  Holland, and that none of his patients will

              25  ever undergo surgery by Dr. Holland.



                                                               126


               1          Q.   And what was the history he had

               2  with him, did he say?

               3          A.   He didn't say, and I didn't ask.

               4  It's none of my business.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Any other doctor then,

               6  other then Dr. Monroe, that ever, to your

               7  knowledge, said anything negative about

               8  Dr. Holland as a -- Dr. Holland as a

               9  physician?

              10          A.   None to my knowledge.

              11          Q.   For example, Dr. Kabour, you

              12  never heard him saying anything negative about

              13  Dr. Holland, correct?

              14          A.   I didn't.

              15          Q.   How often did you speak to

              16  Dr. Kabour, if at all?

              17          A.   Only occasionally, if I answered

              18  the phone, and he was calling something in,

              19  you know, I mean, that was about it.

              20          Q.   Were there any doctors in

              21  particular that you noted that you seemed to

              22  -- that Dr. Holland seemed to have better

              23  relationships with them than others?

              24          A.   I don't know of any.

              25          Q.   How about Dr. Nahhas?



                                                               127


               1          A.   I don't know what kind of

               2  relationship Dr. Holland had with Dr. Nahhas.

               3          Q.   Did Dr. Nahhas refer cases to

               4  Dr. Hashmi?

               5          A.   I would have to go back to the

               6  reports.  I would have to go back to reports

               7  and find out who referred to whom.

               8          Q.   When you say reports, are you

               9  talking about the call logs, or is there

              10  another report?

              11          A.   No, there is -- there is a report

              12  that you can run in the system, you know,

              13  charges.  Financial reports, you can see who

              14  the referring doctors are and stuff like that.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And how would you -- where

              16  are those, in -- the practice group would be

              17  able to run those?

              18          A.   The practice group should be able

              19  to run those.

              20          Q.   Did you, after departing Mercy,

              21  did you stay in touch with anyone from Mercy,

              22  other than maybe receiving a call about this

              23  lawsuit to testify?

              24          A.   I met with Danielle, who took

              25  over my position, maybe once, twice for



                                                               128


               1  dinner, over the course of two years

               2  afterwards.  Just, hi, how you doing, you're

               3  newly married, you know, hi, sort of thing.

               4  But that was it.  I really didn't have any

               5  contact with anyone over there.

               6             Marsha Horner, occasionally,

               7  because I've worked with her forever, so, but

               8  ....

               9          Q.   Danielle Collins, is that who

              10  that was, Danielle Collins?

              11          A.   Yes, but she got married, so her

              12  name is different.

              13          Q.   Did Dr. Holland hire her?

              14          A.   Did Dr. Holland hire her?

              15          Q.   Yes.

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   Did he interview her to be hired?

              18          A.   I think -- I think when we hired

              19  Danielle, we had the doctors sit in on the

              20  interview process.

              21          Q.   Do you know what kind of

              22  relationship she had with Dr. Holland?

              23          A.   It was fearful.

              24          Q.   That's what she told you?

              25          A.   That's what she told me.



                                                               129


               1          Q.   And she took your job when you

               2  left?

               3          A.   Yes.  I thought it was best for

               4  continuity to -- that -- that she remain

               5  there, and then take over my position.  I

               6  wanted to give her the opportunity to do so.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Give me a second.

               8             If you can look at your binder,

               9  first binder, at Exhibit 3.

              10          A.   Oh, good.  Okay.

              11          Q.   Do you know what that is?

              12          A.   Yes.  That's the report that I

              13  was referring to you can run off reports to

              14  see who the referring doctors were.

              15          Q.   So you -- you believe -- and how

              16  is it that those -- those reports are run, do

              17  you know?

              18          A.   I think I used to run these

              19  reports.

              20          Q.   Did you actually see this

              21  document before I just showed it to you?

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   And then when you would run a

              24  report like this, do you have to place certain

              25  parameters in it?



                                                               130


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   In terms of dates and times that

               3  you want to run the report for?

               4          A.   Uh-huh.

               5          Q.   Yes?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   What system is it that this data

               8  resides in, to the best of your knowledge?  Is

               9  this accessible from the practice group?

              10          A.   Well, it was accessible to me.  I

              11  can't remember how it is that I ran -- ran it,

              12  but I ran it.

              13          Q.   Was it through some type of Mercy

              14  intranet software or something, or was it a

              15  practice group software, do you have any

              16  recollection?

              17          A.   Well, we were all using the same

              18  software, so I would say it was a Mercy

              19  software.

              20             THE WITNESS:  It was Epic, right?

              21  Isn't this Epic or not?

              22          Q.   Okay.  How would you -- how would

              23  you actually, like a report like this one that

              24  we're looking at, which is sort of a sample,

              25  how would you -- what would you do in terms of



                                                               131


               1  like trying to run it?  How would you go about

               2  doing that?  Would you plug in data into a --

               3  the computer, or how would you do that?

               4          A.   You know, it's been a couple of

               5  years since I've ran this report, so I

               6  apologize --

               7          Q.   Okay.

               8          A.   -- if my, you know, recall is not

               9  the best.  I would think that what I would do

              10  was go on in there, and put in the parameters

              11  that we wanted, in terms of time, and in terms

              12  of doctors, and in terms of cardiologists.

              13  You could -- you could run it any way that you

              14  wanted to get the information that you needed

              15  --

              16          Q.   Okay.

              17          A.   -- with those filters.

              18          Q.   Okay.  This report, that we have

              19  sort of a summary of, would this be one that

              20  would track those referrals that were on call,

              21  or those that were specifically called in to a

              22  doctor, or you don't know, or both?

              23          A.   No.  This -- this wouldn't have

              24  anything to do with that.

              25          Q.   This wouldn't identify -- what



                                                               132


               1  would this be identifying?

               2          A.   When you put a patient into the

               3  system --

               4          Q.   Uh-huh.

               5          A.   -- you would put in the patient

               6  demographic information, you would put in the

               7  referral, so this would be patients that could

               8  come into the office, and at that point, you

               9  would put in the referring doctor, and then

              10  who the primary surgeon is, so I believe that

              11  that is how this is done.  It was something

              12  separate.

              13          Q.   Okay.  But this would track both

              14  call-in referrals and specifically-requested

              15  referrals?

              16          A.   Sometimes, you know, you would

              17  have to change the referring cardiologist,

              18  because I'm trying to remember.  What you

              19  think might be the cardiologist, when the

              20  patient first comes in, and then, you know,

              21  when they have surgery, you find out, well,

              22  no, this patient actually wanted this

              23  cardiologist.  So occasionally it was rare

              24  when that happened, but ....

              25          Q.   Do you recall a cardiologist



                                                               133


               1  named Steven Bruhl?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   And do you recall that -- whether

               4  he had any preference for who he wanted to

               5  perform his procedures?

               6          A.   I don't have -- I don't have any

               7  knowledge about, specifically about a

               8  preference by Dr. Bruhl.

               9          Q.   Do you recall any preferences by

              10  any specific doctors, as you're sitting here

              11  today, any referring cardiologists?

              12          A.   The only one was Monroe.

              13          Q.   Okay.  Other than him, anyone you

              14  can think of?

              15          A.   No.  Usually you remember who

              16  they don't want, because you'll hear about it,

              17  if they get to a doctor that they don't want.

              18          Q.   Okay.  When you would run --

              19  would you run -- when you would run a report

              20  about referrals, who would it would be that

              21  would ask you to run it, and why would you be

              22  running it, to your knowledge?

              23          A.   It would either be Jennifer

              24  Haaser, who wanted some information, or it

              25  might be the -- might be marketing, or it



                                                               134


               1  might be the medical director.  They would

               2  look -- marketing would look at where are

               3  these referrals coming from and geographic,

               4  you know, and how can we strengthen

               5  relationships with these doctors, in order to,

               6  you know, improve the referal base sort of

               7  thing.

               8          Q.   Okay.  That's all I have right

               9  now.  I might have some follow-up after

              10  Mr. Wiencek, but that's what I have for now.

              11          A.   Okay.

              12          Q.   Okay?  Thank you.

              13                    EXAMINATION

              14  BY MR. WIENCEK:

              15          Q.   Elizabeth, directing your

              16  attention to Exhibit 135, your affidavit.  You

              17  got that in front of you?

              18          A.   I'm looking for it.  Okay.  This.

              19          Q.   Did you have every opportunity to

              20  edit and update that affidavit?

              21          A.   I did.

              22          Q.   Is there anything in that

              23  affidavit you believe is incorrect?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   Anything in that affidavit that



                                                               135


               1  you object to?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Did anyone direct you as to what

               4  to put into the affidavit?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Now that you have been

               7  cross-examined about your affidavit, is there

               8  anything you would recant from that affidavit?

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Now, what specifically were your

              12  duties and responsibilities as practice

              13  manager at Mercy, while you were in that

              14  position?

              15          A.   I managed practice work flows,

              16  hiring of office staff and training,

              17  on-boarding of physicians and PAs, I did -- I

              18  helped with coding and oversaw the -- the

              19  daily operations, handled any communication

              20  issues.

              21          Q.   And you were the practice manager

              22  when Dr. Holland was practicing at

              23  Mercy-St. Vincent, correct?

              24          A.   Correct.

              25          Q.   Now, did you have any role, I



                                                               136


               1  believe you testified earlier, did you have

               2  any role in facilitating Dr. Holland's ability

               3  to practice at Mercy-St. Vincent?

               4          A.   In Dr. Holland's own words, my

               5  job is to facilitate his patients' care and

               6  his practice, so yes.

               7          Q.   When he was first --

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  I'd just like to

               9  note on the record that the witness is reading

              10  from a document that she pulled out of

              11  something.  You --

              12             THE WITNESS:  Do you want to see

              13  the document?

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  I'd just like to

              15  see what the Bates stamp number is.  Yes, I

              16  would, actually.  Just to note, this is

              17  MSV 0004153, with a highlight and a text

              18  message, and then there is handwriting.  This

              19  was Dr. Holland's idea, telling patients to go

              20  to St. Anne's ER and say they have chest pain.

              21  That's the handwriting.

              22          A.   Right.  That's my handwriting.

              23          Q.   Did you on-board Dr. Holland when

              24  he first started practicing at

              25  Mercy-St. Vincent?



                                                               137


               1          A.   I helped -- I helped facilitate

               2  his on-boarding.  It was a different

               3  situation, because he was a Toledo Clinic

               4  physician, so I worked with Toledo Clinic, a

               5  couple of people helped me with that.  There

               6  were -- Charles Kopitke was the one that

               7  helped with the on-boarding of him, because it

               8  was a different situation.  He was -- he was

               9  not our employee, so ....

              10          Q.   How did it differ from -- from a

              11  Mercy employee on-boarding then?

              12          A.   Well, like Toledo Clinic would

              13  take care of his pager and his phone, and you

              14  know, so those sort of things.  And if he

              15  attended a conference, I would submit the

              16  bills to -- to them for reimbursement for

              17  Dr. Holland.  And then -- because I used like

              18  a company credit card for our doctors.  It was

              19  a little easier.  And then if he wanted

              20  journals, or anything that he wanted, the

              21  bills would go to Toledo Clinic, so it was

              22  different in that way.

              23          Q.   Now, you mentioned that referrals

              24  came into the office at Mercy-St. Vincent,

              25  correct?



                                                               138


               1          A.   Correct.

               2          Q.   Was there any specific gatekeeper

               3  assigned to distribute those referrals?

               4          A.   No.  Anyone who answered the

               5  phone would send those out.

               6          Q.   Are you aware at any time when a

               7  referring physician's request was not honored?

               8          A.   No.  If a surgeon was out of

               9  town, let's say they wanted Dr. Smith, and

              10  Dr. Smith was out of town on vacation, then we

              11  would let the referring doctor know that, I'm

              12  sorry, Dr. Smith is unavailable, would it be

              13  okay, you know, for the doctor on call to

              14  receive this.  So that -- that would be the

              15  only time that we did it, you know,

              16  technically.

              17          Q.   Was there ever a time when you

              18  were directed not to refer a patient to a

              19  specific doctor?

              20          A.   Not by anyone in the practice,

              21  only Dr. Todd Monroe was the one instance that

              22  I remember.

              23          Q.   Did you ever hear or see anything

              24  that would lead you to believe that patient

              25  referrals for surgery at Mercy-St. Vincent



                                                               139


               1  were done based on a surgeon's race or

               2  national origin?

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               4          A.   Never.

               5          Q.   Now, in your affidavit, is it

               6  true that you actually read pages 293, 411 and

               7  451 of Dr. Holland's deposition given on the

               8  12th and 13th of March of 2019?

               9          A.   I did.

              10          Q.   Okay.  I'm going to give you the

              11  -- those excerpts.

              12          A.   Okay.

              13          Q.   I want to direct your attention

              14  to page 293, line 15.  I'm going to read this

              15  aloud for you.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Dr. Hashmi instructed Elizabeth

              18  Sheroian, the practice manager who was

              19  mentioned in the previous document, to not

              20  distribute those consultations.  Those

              21  consultations were to Dr. Hashmi's group, and

              22  he had the right to determine who got them.

              23             Is that a true statement?  That's a

              24  statement by Dr. Holland in his deposition.

              25          A.   That's a false statement.



                                                               140


               1          Q.   Okay.

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Just -- just to

               3  note for the record that this page is marked

               4  confidential, and that Mr. Wiencek distributed

               5  it to this witness in violation of the

               6  confidentiality order.

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  That's your

               8  interpretation.

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Additionally, I

              10  move to strike her comment referring to my

              11  client as creating a false testimony.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  You can --

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  She's not qualified

              14  to render an opinion about false testimony.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  She's qualified to

              16  render an opinion as to whether she actually

              17  said what he said she said she said, so ....

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  She's not qualified

              19  to call my client -- well, I'm just going to

              20  note it, because --

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  She's not making any

              22  allegations.

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- you're ongoing

              24  behavior is to solicit an ongoing retaliation

              25  --



                                                               141


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  No.

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- against my

               3  client --

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  No.  That's --

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- through the

               6  deposition process.  We will note it on the

               7  record.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  You can note it on

               9  the record.

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Please continue,

              11  sir.

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  It's false.

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  Please continue.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  It's false.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  You're -- you're a

              16  liar.

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  It's false.

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  You're the one --

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  It's false.

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- passing on

              21  falsehoods.  Please continue, sir.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  Okay.

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  Please continue.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Take a look at

              25  page 411, line 13.  There is a question in



                                                               142


               1  line 13.  So do you have any personal

               2  knowledge, though, that when there was no

               3  request for a specific surgeon, and you were

               4  on call, that you did not specifically get the

               5  consult?

               6             And then the answer is, Absolutely.

               7  Absolutely.

               8             Underneath that, What do you base

               9  that knowledge on?

              10             And underneath that, the answer is,

              11  Conversations with Elizabeth, conversations

              12  with Elizabeth, and underneath that, Sheroian.

              13  Sheroian.

              14             Is that an accurate statement?  Did

              15  you ever make any such statement?

              16          A.   No.

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  And I would also

              18  object to that being read out of context and

              19  not reading lines 24 and 25, which therefore

              20  makes what you read misleading.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) So did you ever

              22  tell him that when there was no requests for a

              23  specific surgeon, and Dr. Holland was on call,

              24  that he was not going to get the consult?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               143


               1          Q.   Now, do you know Dr. Andrabi?

               2          A.   Only in a professional capacity.

               3          Q.   Was he an executive leader

               4  position at Mercy-St. Vincent while you were

               5  there?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   Are you aware of anyone at

               8  Mercy-St. Vincent, including Dr. Andrabi, who

               9  redirected consults away from any surgeons on

              10  any basis, including race or national origin?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Would it have been possible under

              13  the system for him to do that --

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object --

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) -- based on your

              16  knowledge of the system?

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              18          A.   It would be impossible.

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Calls for

              20  speculation.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Okay.  Are you

              22  aware of any issues that Dr. Holland had, and

              23  how he practiced as a surgeon while at MSV, at

              24  Mercy-St. Vincent?

              25          A.   Issues?



                                                               144


               1          Q.   Yes.

               2          A.   There were communication issues,

               3  there were billing documentation issues, there

               4  were anger management issues, there were

               5  patient safety care issues.  That was what I

               6  got up -- so upset about before, was the

               7  patient care issues.

               8          Q.   Were there cardiologists who did

               9  not want patients referred to him?

              10          A.   Dr. Todd Monroe.

              11          Q.   I'm going to mark this as

              12  Sheroian A.

              13             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit A

              14  was marked for identification.)

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you

              16  what's been marked as Deposition Exhibit

              17  Sheroian A.  It's an 11-19-13 email about

              18  Dr. Monroe not wanting Holland to see his

              19  patients.  Did you write this email?

              20          A.   I did.

              21          Q.   And who is Dr. Monroe?

              22          A.   Dr. Todd Monroe.  He's a

              23  cardiologist with NWOCC.

              24          Q.   And did he ever express to you

              25  why he did not want Dr. Holland to see his



                                                               145


               1  patients?

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object as asked and

               3  answered.

               4          A.   Verbatim, he said that he had a

               5  history with Dr. Holland, and I didn't

               6  question, you know, what that meant.  I wasn't

               7  about to.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Mark this as Sheroian B.

               9             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit B

              10  was marked for identification.)

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you

              12  what's been marked as Deposition Sheroian

              13  Exhibit B.  It's an 11-5-14 memo regarding

              14  Holland unavailable for emergencies.  Did you

              15  write this email?

              16          A.   I did.

              17          Q.   And what was the issue here,

              18  Elizabeth?

              19          A.   Well, the issue that Dr. Holland

              20  was on call, and we could not reach him for

              21  that emergency.  That was that third incident

              22  within, you know, 34 days.  That's what I was

              23  referring to.

              24          Q.   Now, in your experience as the

              25  practice manager, was that a regular



                                                               146


               1  occurrence with regard to Dr. Holland?

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to form.

               3          A.   It was.

               4          Q.   And in what way?

               5          A.   In the fact that communication

               6  with him was being -- that it was impossible.

               7  That you couldn't reach him by cellphone.  If

               8  the cellphone went to voicemail, the voicemail

               9  was full, so you couldn't leave a message.  I

              10  wasn't able to -- I wasn't able to text him.

              11  I was able to text him, but there was no

              12  response.  And I overhead paged.  Sometimes I

              13  would go out into the hospital, running

              14  around, looking for where he could be, if I

              15  thought he was there at the hospital.  The

              16  issue was patient safety.

              17          Q.   Mark this as Sheroian C.

              18             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit C

              19  was marked for identification.)

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) This is an

              21  August 25th, 2015 email about Dr. Holland

              22  going out of town.  Did you write this email?

              23          A.   I did.

              24          Q.   And what was the issue here?

              25          A.   He was on call, and he decided to



                                                               147


               1  leave town and not tell anyone.  So I find out

               2  that he called Dr. Phillips in surgery, the

               3  next morning, that morning, and asked him to

               4  take call and see the consult.  So again, it's

               5  -- it's a situation where a doctor's on call,

               6  and supposed to be responsible for -- for the

               7  hospital, for patients' care, and he just ups

               8  and leaves and doesn't tell anyone.  That

               9  leaves us without coverage.  That's a huge

              10  liability issue.  That's a patient safety

              11  issue.  That could have ended very badly.  I'm

              12  sorry.  I'm getting upset again.

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  Please mark the

              14  record.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Mark this as

              16  Sheroian D.

              17             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit D

              18  was marked for identification.)

              19          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you

              20  what's been marked Deposition Exhibit D,

              21  Sheroian, 5-13-13 email about Holland being on

              22  call and not being able to be contacted.

              23             Did you write this email?

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              25          A.   I do -- I did write this email.



                                                               148


               1          Q.   And what was the issue in this

               2  email?

               3          A.   Okay.  Holland was on call.  The

               4  issue was Dr. Holland didn't want to follow

               5  Coumadin regulations on his patients, but the

               6  other doctors did.  So Dr. Holland is on call.

               7  And visiting nurse called up and said, well,

               8  what about the Coumadin orders for Dr. Hashmi,

               9  or one of the other doctor's patients.  And he

              10  said that we do not follow Coumadin

              11  regulations on our patients.  He was rude to

              12  them.  Do not -- so rude, that they didn't

              13  want to talk to him again.  He was verbally

              14  abusive to them.  How do you have a

              15  relationship with a visiting nurse, to take

              16  care of our patients, if they don't want to

              17  speak to the doctor because of how he treats

              18  them?

              19             So my -- my question here was,

              20  well, how do we handle these sort of

              21  situations?  When you're supposed to be

              22  responsible for the other doctors' patients,

              23  while you're on call, and you're just --

              24  you're throwing it up in the air.  So that was

              25  -- that was my concern, what do we do in these



                                                               149


               1  instances.

               2          Q.   And what about the second

               3  paragraph about the front office expressing

               4  concerns?

               5          A.   Again, Sharon was our nurse, and

               6  she had a patient care question for him.  His

               7  phone didn't pick up.  And when she called him

               8  again, he -- she didn't receive a response.

               9  And he doesn't normally check his email, so --

              10  or voicemail, so how do you -- how are we --

              11  how are we supposed to reach this man to ask

              12  him questions about patients, when he blocks

              13  everything that every -- every avenue that we

              14  try?  And he gets verbally abusive.  He gets

              15  angry if you question him.  So -- and he gets

              16  even angrier if you confront him.  So if you

              17  ask a question about patient care, he just

              18  doesn't want to be bothered.

              19             So that was, that was the issue in

              20  the second paragraph, is -- is how do you

              21  communicate with someone that doesn't want to

              22  be communicating about such an important

              23  subject as patient care for God's sakes.

              24          Q.   Next one mark as Sheroian E.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Also, I'm just



                                                               150


               1  going to object to the extent we're using

               2  duplicate exhibits in these depositions.

               3  Later on, we'll have to consolidate.

               4             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit E

               5  was marked for identification.)

               6          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Exhibit E is a

               7  June 21st, 2013 email about Holland liking to

               8  keep his Mondays and Fridays open.

               9          A.   Uh-huh.

              10          Q.   Did you write this email?

              11          A.   I did.

              12          Q.   And --

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  I object to the

              14  form, and mostly to what you claim this says,

              15  because that's not what the email says.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you write

              17  this email?

              18          A.   I did.

              19          Q.   And what is the issue in this

              20  email?

              21          A.   Okay.  Let's see here.  He liked

              22  to keep his -- I think I was letting Peggy

              23  know about -- like to come here.  So she was

              24  -- she was looking to set up an office at

              25  Toledo Clinic for him, and she wanted to know



                                                               151


               1  about his availability.  And so I let her know

               2  that he's there in the Mercy cardiothoracic

               3  office on Tuesday mornings from 10:45 to noon,

               4  but that he also didn't want to have anything

               5  on his calendar, his patients, or surgery

               6  wise, for Mondays and Fridays.

               7          Q.   Did other surgeons request --

               8  make that same request?

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Objection.

              10  Misstating --

              11          A.   Never.

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- the sentence

              13  that's on the piece of paper.  It's not read

              14  correctly.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did other

              16  surgeons refuse to work on Mondays and

              17  Fridays?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   Did you have any idea of why

              20  Dr. Holland wanted to keep Mondays and Fridays

              21  open?

              22          A.   I think he wanted long weekends

              23  to go boating, or just long weekends to do

              24  whatever.  Because you -- there is no reason

              25  for you to have Mondays and Fridays open.  The



                                                               152


               1  only scenario where that would take place, is

               2  if a physician is on call for the weekend, he

               3  might want to keep his Monday light, in case

               4  an emergency came in over the weekend, not

               5  your Friday.  No, not -- and not consistently.

               6  That would only be for a physician who is on

               7  call for the weekend.  That's the only

               8  scenario that I can see that would make sense.

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  I move to strike

              10  the entire response.

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  And I move to strike

              12  your move to strike.

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  And mark the

              14  record, please.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Mark it, please, in

              16  bold for Mr. -- Mr. Archinaco.

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  Mr. Wiencek, I

              18  think you think it's humorous, but I mark the

              19  record so I make it easier for me to go back

              20  to specific points for future reference.

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  And we have too.

              22  Trust me.

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  You seem to do it

              24  every time I do it, simply to try to aggravate

              25  me.  Doesn't work, though.



                                                               153


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Please mark this as

               2  Sheroian F.

               3             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit F

               4  was marked for identification.)

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  Copy for counsel?

               6             MR. WIENCEK:  Oh, sorry.  I thought

               7  I gave it to you.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you

               9  what's been marked as Exhibit F, Deposition

              10  Exhibit F, an email that was sent to you by

              11  Amber Worthington.  Who is Amber Worthington?

              12          A.   She was one of our medical

              13  assistants in the front office.

              14          Q.   And have you seen this email

              15  before?

              16          A.   I definitely have.

              17          Q.   And what was the issue being

              18  expressed in this email to you?

              19          A.   Dr. Holland had office clinic.

              20  One of the patients was a consultation for him

              21  to see.  The patient had been waiting.

              22  Dr. Holland disappeared and never came back.

              23  He just disappeared.

              24             So Amber let me know that Holland

              25  didn't see his consultation, that he left.



                                                               154


               1  Now, the patient's been sitting there, and

               2  there is no doctor to see this patient.

               3  That's the issue.  Oh, my God.  How can you

               4  just -- and we couldn't contact him, we

               5  couldn't reach him to say, hey, you know, why

               6  aren't you back here, where did you go?  There

               7  is a patient sitting here waiting for you.  I

               8  don't understand that.

               9          Q.   Okay.  The next one is -- mark

              10  it, please, as Sheroian G.

              11             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit G

              12  was marked for identification.)

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) And this is a

              14  June 26, 2014 email from you to Jayne

              15  Beckstead.  And who is Jayne Beckstead again?

              16          A.   She was in charge of Mercy

              17  Physician Enterprises, so she was Jennifer

              18  Haaser's supervisor.

              19          Q.   And what was the issue here,

              20  Elizabeth?

              21          A.   There -- there was a Quarterly

              22  Heart and Vascular Leadership Team Meeting,

              23  and Dr. Holland was not at that meeting, which

              24  he should have been at that meeting.  But the

              25  issue here is he sent a PA in his place, Adam



                                                               155


               1  in his place.  That is unheard of.  You never

               2  send a PA in your place.

               3             What message does that send?  Well,

               4  I'm too busy, I'm too important to attend.

               5  Here is, you know, here is my delegate, who's

               6  not even a physician, who has no business even

               7  being in this meeting.

               8          Q.   What exactly is a Quarterly Heart

               9  and Vascular Leadership Team Meeting?

              10             THE WITNESS:  Greg, can you answer

              11  that?

              12          Q.   No, you got to answer.

              13          A.   Oh, I got to answer it.  I --

              14  I've never attended one of these meetings, so

              15  my assumption would be that it would be the

              16  physician team getting together and

              17  discussing, you know, things that they needed

              18  to do as far as changes.

              19          Q.   So who is Adam that is mentioned

              20  in this email?

              21          A.   Adam is the physician assistant.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And did Dr. Holland, based

              23  on your knowledge, did he delegate attendance

              24  of these meetings to Adam on a regular basis?

              25          A.   I don't know.



                                                               156


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Objection, form.

               2          A.   This was the only instance that I

               3  knew of.

               4          Q.   Are you aware of whether other

               5  doctors delegated attendance at these meetings

               6  to physician assistants?

               7          A.   Never.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the

               9  extent it calls for speculation.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did -- did

              11  Dr. Holland --

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  Lack of foundation.

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) -- did

              14  Dr. Holland ever express to you an attitude

              15  about attending meetings?

              16          A.   He didn't like to attend

              17  meetings.  He was very specific with me on

              18  what his wishes were, which were no early

              19  morning meetings.  A lot of times, you know,

              20  especially surgeons, they have to have 6:30,

              21  7 o'clock, 7:30 a.m. meetings.  He didn't want

              22  to attend any meetings that were early

              23  morning, no meetings on Fridays or Mondays.

              24  He was very clear and very specific about

              25  that.



                                                               157


               1          Q.   Mark this Sheroian H.

               2             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit H

               3  was marked for identification.)

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you write

               5  this email, it's Exhibit H?

               6          A.   I did.

               7          Q.   April 23rd, 2014 email.  And what

               8  was the issue here?

               9          A.   The issue was Dr. Holland's

              10  attendance in the meetings.

              11          Q.   Now, what kind of meetings were

              12  these?  Now, it indicates multidisciplinary

              13  meetings.

              14          A.   Right.  So this is a separate

              15  meeting than the other, and I don't think he

              16  was -- I don't think he was addressing just

              17  these multidisciplinary meetings, which was --

              18  these were monthly meetings.  They were over

              19  at the hospital, and they had physicians

              20  there, they had PAs, they had anesthesia

              21  there, they had some cardiologists, nurses on

              22  the floors.

              23             So the purpose of those meetings,

              24  and the only reason why I know that is I

              25  actually did attend one.  The purpose there is



                                                               158


               1  to discuss problems, bring up any issues that

               2  are recurring, come up with solutions, so it

               3  was really a full picture of everyone getting

               4  together and trying to do quality improvement

               5  for that department.

               6          Q.   Was Dr. Holland attending those

               7  meetings?

               8          A.   He was not.

               9          Q.   Please mark this as Sheroian I.

              10             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit I

              11  was marked for identification.)

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) This is a

              13  June 19, 2013 email from Cynthia Zapotosky to

              14  you, regarding call from home care.  Have you

              15  seen this email before?

              16          A.   I have.

              17          Q.   And who is Cynthia?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  I would just

              19  object, given the fact that at least a quarter

              20  of this email was redacted without

              21  explanation.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Okay.  And who

              23  is Cynthia?

              24          A.   Cindy was in charge of the floor,

              25  the CV floor, at the time.



                                                               159


               1          Q.   Okay.  And what was the issue in

               2  this email?

               3          A.   The issue was the discharge

               4  medications for our patients, and it opened up

               5  a bigger conversation about how it is we

               6  should handle this.

               7             There was -- let's see here.  There

               8  was an issue with Nichole, who was one of our

               9  physician assistants at the time and

              10  Dr. Holland.  And there was a contraindication

              11  for two anticoagulant medications to be given

              12  to a patient at one time.  So what we're

              13  trying to do was close that loop on any

              14  miscommunication that could have occurred

              15  between Dr. Holland and Nichole, and make sure

              16  that our patients were taken care of in a safe

              17  manner.  So we were tying to -- we were trying

              18  to do something about that.

              19          Q.   Now, in the -- in the fifth line

              20  of this email, it indicates, she was very

              21  upset, after he spoke with her.  What was

              22  going on there?

              23          A.   Dr. Holland is -- can be very --

              24  can be very mean, when he communicates.  Can

              25  be very accusatory when he -- when he



                                                               160


               1  communicates.  So I'm sure he was accusing her

               2  of making a mistake, and she was very upset

               3  about that.

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object as --

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What else --

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- calling for

               7  speculation.  Move to strike as being

               8  speculative.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What did she say

              10  about it, her experience?

              11          A.   Nichole spoke to me about that

              12  incident.

              13          Q.   What did --

              14          A.   It's not speculation.

              15          Q.   -- what did she say about it?

              16          A.   She was in tears.  She was very

              17  upset the way that he spoke to her about it,

              18  blaming her for the patient being discharged

              19  on the two medications.

              20          Q.   Next one is Sheroian J.

              21             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit J

              22  was marked for identification.)

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) This is a

              24  December 17th, 2015 email from you to Jennifer

              25  Haaser, per Dr. Phillips.  Have you seen this



                                                               161


               1  before?

               2          A.   I have seen this.

               3          Q.   And did you write the email?

               4          A.   I did.

               5          Q.   And what was the issue that you

               6  were trying to express in this email?

               7          A.   Well, the issue was -- let's see

               8  here now -- was billing documentation.

               9  Dr. Holland wasn't always good about providing

              10  detailed billing documentation for his op

              11  notes, and for his -- for his consultations,

              12  which, of course, affects our bottom line.

              13          Q.   What do you mean by that?

              14          A.   Well, in op notes, you know, you

              15  can't just say like, closed according to

              16  standard procedure.  You have to detail very

              17  specifically how it is that you -- you closed,

              18  and -- and what it was that you did.  There is

              19  a lot of documentation specificity that --

              20  that happens, you know?  And with consultation

              21  notes too.  You can't just say, saw the

              22  patient, patient needs CABG.  You have to

              23  describe the patient's medical history and

              24  where the course of action is, you have to be

              25  very detailed about it, in order to bill



                                                               162


               1  accordingly.

               2          Q.   And what was Dr. Holland doing

               3  that was objectionable?

               4          A.   He was -- he had not --

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               6          A.   Let's see.  Okay.  Sometimes they

               7  don't always dictate their op notes

               8  immediately after surgery, and then you're

               9  waiting and you're waiting.  And so if you

              10  wait too long, then you can't bill out for it.

              11  And that was some of the -- some of the

              12  problems that we had, incomplete

              13  documentation, so we couldn't bill out for

              14  what was done.

              15          Q.   And what was Dr. Phillips doing

              16  in this -- in this situation, says

              17  Dr. Phillips is requesting?

              18          A.   He was -- he was the medical

              19  director at the time.  He was looking at the

              20  bottom line.  I would see -- I would run off

              21  monthly reports, and I would confirm them in

              22  the OR, with the OR staff, as far as, you

              23  know, all of that, to make sure that we had

              24  billed out for all the procedures that were

              25  done.



                                                               163


               1             And so Phillips was seeing, well,

               2  okay, there is these outstanding charges.

               3  These are, you know, we haven't billed for

               4  that.  We could lose money for this, so ....

               5          Q.   What -- what was he trying to

               6  say, bump this documentation problem with

               7  Dr. Holland up the chain of command?  What

               8  exactly happened?

               9          A.   Because Dr. Holland --

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Objection to the

              11  form.

              12          A.   -- wasn't doing it.

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  That's not what

              14  Dr. Phillips said.  That's what Ms. -- she

              15  wrote to Jennifer Haaser, so it misstates the

              16  document.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What did

              18  Dr. Phillips request?

              19          A.   He requested -- what was his

              20  request?

              21          Q.   Uh-huh.

              22          A.   Was that it be bumped on up the

              23  chain of command, because it did affect our

              24  productivity.  There -- there could be charts

              25  sitting on Dr. Holland's desk for -- for



                                                               164


               1  weeks, because he wouldn't come into the

               2  office, or he wouldn't check and see, you

               3  know, even though we sent him emails.  He --

               4  he wasn't providing the services that we

               5  needed in order to bill.

               6          Q.   Please mark this as Sheroian K.

               7             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit K

               8  was marked for identification.)

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) This is a

              10  March 19th, 2014 email to Beth Janowiecki from

              11  you.

              12          A.   Uh-huh.

              13          Q.   And who is Beth Janowiecki?

              14          A.   She did, for a period of time,

              15  she worked in the office doing our billing.

              16          Q.   What was the issue being

              17  expressed here?

              18          A.   Well, there was a -- there was an

              19  op note that was outstanding, that Dr. Holland

              20  hadn't completed the information on, as far as

              21  what he did, so we didn't know if it was

              22  billable or not.

              23          Q.   Was this a recurring problem?

              24          A.   There were some instances of it,

              25  yes.



                                                               165


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

               2  of the question.

               3          A.   For every op note that you do,

               4  there should be a consultation note also.  And

               5  that was one thing that Beth Janowiecki

               6  checked, and I did too.  And you didn't always

               7  have the consultation notes for an operative

               8  patient.  And of course, that affects the

               9  bottom line.

              10          Q.   Please mark this as Sheroian L.

              11             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit L

              12  was marked for identification.)

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) This is a

              14  June 10, 2014 email from Beth again to you,

              15  regarding consult and procedure.  Have you

              16  seen this before?

              17          A.   I have.

              18          Q.   Who is Denise Fowler?

              19          A.   That is -- this is Beth

              20  Janowiecki.

              21          Q.   That's true.  Sorry.  What was

              22  going on in this email?

              23          A.   Okay.  Okay.  So you can bill for

              24  a consultation note and the daily visits for

              25  -- for patients that, you know, that you



                                                               166


               1  haven't done surgery on.  So there were some

               2  notations from Adam and from Paul, but we

               3  never had the consultation note from

               4  Dr. Holland, so once again, it's a billing

               5  documentation, revenue loss issue.

               6          Q.   Compared to other surgeons who

               7  were practicing at Mercy, how did Dr. Holland

               8  compare in terms of his documentation to the

               9  other doctors?

              10             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              11          A.   It is --

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  Lack of foundation

              13  and speculation without a proper foundation.

              14          A.   His documentation was not as good

              15  as the other physicians, and he wasn't

              16  consistent, even though we brought it to his

              17  attention and provided education from the --

              18  from the coders, he was not as good.  He's not

              19  detailed.

              20          Q.   This one would be Sheroian L.

              21             THE REPORTER:  M.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  M?

              23             THE REPORTER:  Yeah.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Okay.  I'm sorry.

              25             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit M



                                                               167


               1  was marked for identification.)

               2          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did you get

               3  yours?

               4          A.   This is the same one.  This is

               5  the same one that we just got.

               6          Q.   Oh.  That's my bad.  Here is

               7  Sheroian M.  I'm sorry about that.

               8             This is a May 15, 2015 email from

               9  you to Denise Fowler.

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And who is Denise Fowler?

              12          A.   She was -- she was in legal at

              13  St. V's.

              14          Q.   And what is the issue here?

              15          A.   This is a big issue here.  I sent

              16  it to her, and I don't contact Denise very

              17  often, unless I feel that there is -- there is

              18  something terribly wrong.

              19             There was a patient that was seen

              20  in our office for a consultation, and

              21  Dr. Holland was going to do surgery.  We went

              22  to schedule the surgery, and found out that

              23  the patient couldn't come to Mercy facilities.

              24  The patient could only go to a ProMedica

              25  facility.  So I contacted Dr. Holland to let



                                                               168


               1  him know that we couldn't do surgery, you

               2  know, on this patient, because her insurance

               3  wouldn't allow her to come to our facilities.

               4             So what he did was he contacted the

               5  PAs and the front office staff, and told them

               6  to tell the patient to go to the St. Anne's ER

               7  and complain of chest pain, so that she could

               8  be admitted and have surgery by him.  And that

               9  is insurance fraud.  That I -- I couldn't -- I

              10  was -- that -- I couldn't believe it.  So --

              11  so I directed them to absolutely do not do

              12  that.  And I let Dr. Holland know that, no, we

              13  are not going to do that, and he got upset.

              14          Q.   What is -- how did he get upset?

              15          A.   He sent me a reminder of what my

              16  job duties were, which was to facilitate his

              17  patients' care and his practice.  So I took

              18  that as a veiled threat, but, in a way, but

              19  not really, because he's a -- he's a Toledo

              20  Clinic employee.  He's a Toledo Clinic

              21  physician.  He has no power over me.

              22          Q.   This is Sheroian N.

              23             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit N

              24  was marked for identification.)

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) I think we went



                                                               169


               1  over this before.

               2          A.   Yeah.

               3          Q.   Now, what were you actually

               4  referring to about officially informing

               5  Dr. Holland of his release?

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object as asked and

               7  answered.

               8          A.   I was under the impression -- of

               9  course, you heard this.  I was given hope that

              10  they were going to release Dr. Holland, that

              11  they were going to end his service agreement.

              12  But you know, that was right -- well, no.

              13  That wasn't right before I left.  So obviously

              14  this had been going on for quite a period of

              15  time, but I don't know what the -- I don't

              16  know why we couldn't get a break from his

              17  service agreement.  I have no idea, but I kept

              18  hoping.

              19             And I didn't know who was going to

              20  -- I thought it was a done deal.  Obviously,

              21  not.  I just didn't know who was going to tell

              22  him about it at the time.

              23          Q.   Just give me a minute.  I might

              24  have a few more questions.

              25             Based on your knowledge as the

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Who supervised

               3  long Dr. Holland worked each day?

               4          A.   Dr. Holland.

               5          Q.   Okay.  I think I'm done.

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  Some follow-up.

               7                    REEXAMINATION

               8  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

               9          Q.   The words race or national origin

              10  were used earlier today by Mr. Wiencek.  What

              11  is your understanding as to what race is?

              12          A.   What race is?

              13          Q.   Yes.  What is race?  What is your

              14  understanding as to what that word means?

              15          A.   Well, categorized as, you know,

              16  black, white, you know, that's -- that's what

              17  race means to me.

              18          Q.   Do you believe there is multiple

              19  races of human beings?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              21          A.   Well, of course.

              22          Q.   You do?  You think black people

              23  are a different race than white people?

              24          A.   No.  No.  I was thinking mix.

              25  Mixes of races.  When you're talking about



                                                               172


               1  multiple, I'm thinking about, you know, people

               2  with -- with multiple races.

               3          Q.   But a black person, just a black

               4  person, versus a white person, are they

               5  different race?

               6          A.   Yes, they are.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Have you ever been told

               8  you're a racist?

               9          A.   No.

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              11          A.   They are different, not one

              12  better than the other.  They're just

              13  different.

              14          Q.   You don't -- you don't realize

              15  that the difference between a black person and

              16  a white person is that they have more pigment

              17  in their skin --

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              19  argumentative.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- that causes

              21  their skin to be darker?  You don't realize

              22  that they're -- that's the difference?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Narrative,

              24  argumentative.

              25          A.   I -- I guess I don't understand



                                                               173


               1  what it is you're trying to say.

               2          Q.   Fair enough.  Do you understand

               3  any distinction between race and national

               4  origin?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   What is your understanding as to

               7  a distinction between those concepts?

               8          A.   One is where you were born, and

               9  one is -- is your race.  There is a

              10  difference.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Now, with regard -- you

              12  indicated you were concerned, obviously, about

              13  any patient care issues that doctor, or strike

              14  that.

              15             Any patient care or patient safety

              16  issues that Dr. Holland had, correct?

              17          A.   Say again.

              18          Q.   You were concerned, any time you

              19  saw a patient care, or a patient safety issue

              20  with Dr. Holland, correct?

              21          A.   I was concerned.

              22          Q.   And then anytime you saw a

              23  patient care or patient safety issue with

              24  Dr. Hashmi, were you equally concerned?

              25          A.   I'm trying to think of instances.



                                                               174


               1  I don't recall instances like with

               2  Dr. Holland.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Do you recall any

               4  instances that you can think of that, at all,

               5  with Dr. Hashmi, where there was any concern

               6  about patient care or safety?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   So you never heard from any

               9  source that his statistics, when it came to

              10  the surgeries, were higher than national

              11  averages?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              13  foundation.

              14          A.   No.

              15          Q.   Now, you indicated that

              16  Dr. Nahhas supervised Dr. Holland.  How do you

              17  know that?

              18          A.   I -- from an email that Nahhas

              19  was in -- was the one who hired Dr. Holland

              20  over at Toledo Clinic.

              21          Q.   Who conducted peer review for

              22  Dr. Holland, do you know?

              23          A.   I don't know.

              24          Q.   Do you know who conducted

              25  Dr. Hashmi's peer review?



                                                               175


               1          A.   It's a good question.  I'm trying

               2  to think, because I'm not sure how the peer

               3  review process at St. V's, on an

               4  administrative level, was done.

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Please don't

               6  speculate.

               7          A.   That's the answer to my question.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Now, you indicated --

               9  there was a mention of Todd Monroe's name

              10  specifically.  Do you know how many years

              11  earlier that Dr. Holland had ever had a

              12  problem with Dr. Monroe?

              13          A.   No.  I -- I don't know.

              14          Q.   Were you aware that Dr. Holland

              15  -- strike that.

              16             Do you know whether or not the

              17  problem that Dr. Holland had with Dr. Monroe

              18  may have occurred 20 years prior to your

              19  discussions with Dr. Monroe?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              21          A.   I don't know that.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  -- foundation.

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you know

              24  whether or not Dr. Monroe had even spoken to

              25  Dr. Holland in -- in -- in 20 years by the



                                                               176


               1  time he had spoken to you or mentioned

               2  anything to you?

               3          A.   It was not mentioned.

               4          Q.   Do you know why Dr. Holland's

               5  contract was not renewed or was terminated?

               6          A.   I was gone by then.

               7          Q.   Did you ever hear any discussions

               8  that the service agreement had been terminated

               9  prior -- strike that.

              10             Coming back to the exhibits that

              11  were handed out to you just now from

              12  Mr. Wiencek.  First, I want to just go through

              13  these.  Let me find the order here.  Okay.  If

              14  you can look at Exhibit E, please.

              15          A.   Exhibit E.

              16          Q.   Defendant's Exhibit E.

              17          A.   I'm trying to find -- okay.

              18          Q.   This is an email, at the top,

              19  that you wrote June 21st, 2013 to Peggy Trapp;

              20  is that correct?

              21          A.   That is correct.

              22          Q.   Were you trying to be accurate at

              23  the time you wrote this email to Peggy Trapp?

              24          A.   Trying to be accurate?

              25          Q.   Yes.  Were you trying to be



                                                               177


               1  accurate and tell the truth?

               2          A.   Why wouldn't I be?

               3          Q.   Okay.  So when you were being

               4  asked questions earlier today, you talked

               5  about Monday and Friday schedule being kept

               6  open for Dr. Holland.  And then you said so

               7  that he could go boating.  But that's not

               8  what's written here.  It says for emergency

               9  cases written here, doesn't it?

              10          A.   That's what he said.

              11          Q.   Okay.  Well, this is what you

              12  wrote -- this is what you wrote to Ms. Trapp.

              13  You didn't have to -- if you didn't believe

              14  Dr. Holland, you didn't have to write that,

              15  correct?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              17  argumentative and misstating the record.

              18          A.   I was writing what Dr. Holland

              19  told me.

              20          Q.   That he likes to keep his Monday

              21  and Friday schedule free for emergency cases,

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   And did you have any further

              25  discussion with Dr. Holland about why it is he



                                                               178


               1  liked to keep Mondays and Fridays open for

               2  emergency cases?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Do you know whether or not

               5  statistically Fridays and Mondays are days

               6  when more emergent surgeries are typically

               7  presented?

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               9  foundation.

              10          A.   I don't know that.

              11          Q.   And you are -- you have never

              12  been a cardiothoracic surgeon, correct?

              13          A.   Never.

              14          Q.   The next exhibit you were shown,

              15  Exhibit F, where I think you stated that

              16  "Dr. Holland just disappeared".  This is from

              17  August 19th, 2015.

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   This was referenced as an email,

              20  but actually, this was a, one of those instant

              21  messages, or what have you, that Mercy had,

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Okay.  Yes.

              24          Q.   Okay.  You didn't respond at all

              25  to this then?  You didn't write anything back?



                                                               179


               1          A.   I probably walked up to the front

               2  of the office to find out what the situation

               3  was.

               4          Q.   All right.  Next one, Exhibit G.

               5          A.   G.

               6          Q.   This is about sending Adam in his

               7  place in June of 2014.

               8          A.   Correct.

               9          Q.   Do you know where Dr. Holland was

              10  that day?

              11          A.   I have no idea where Dr. Holland

              12  was that day.

              13          Q.   Exhibit H.  In this email that

              14  was used, Dr. Hashmi was wondering what was

              15  specified in Holland's contract as to meeting

              16  attendance, correct?

              17          A.   Correct.

              18          Q.   And I believe you testified

              19  earlier that Dr. Holland was not an employee

              20  of Mercy; is that right?

              21          A.   That is correct.

              22          Q.   And so here, in the last two

              23  sentences, you write, if he is supposed to do

              24  this, then it will be addressed.  If not in

              25  his contract, then Dr. Hashmi will not say



                                                               180


               1  anything to Dr. Holland.  Correct?

               2          A.   That's what it says.

               3          Q.   Okay.  So did you ever find out

               4  what Dr. Holland's contract said about him

               5  attending meetings?

               6          A.   Never.

               7          Q.   Exhibit I.  Just have a couple of

               8  questions about who the people are.  Who is

               9  Cynthia Zap -- Zapotosky?

              10          A.   She was the -- the nurse in

              11  charge of the floor, nurse manager in charge

              12  of the floor.

              13          Q.   And who was Phillip J. Nelson?

              14          A.   Where are you seeing Phillip?

              15          Q.   Right before the big black

              16  redacted block on Exhibit I.

              17          A.   From, to.  Phil Nelson, wasn't he

              18  the perfusionist, he was a perfusionist?  I

              19  think.  I didn't write that, so I didn't put

              20  Phil -- Phillip Nelson in there.

              21          Q.   Okay.  You don't know him to be

              22  an attorney, though, correct?

              23          A.   No, I don't know who he is.

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  So we would make a



                                                               181


               1  request that this document be produced in an

               2  unredacted state.  That's not for you to worry

               3  about, Ms. Sheroian.

               4          A.   Yeah, that's -- Phil, it was

               5  Lepkowski who was the -- who was the

               6  perfusionist.  I apologize.

               7          Q.   Did Dr. Holland ever make you

               8  cry?

               9          A.   No.  I am a professional.  I do

              10  not cry at work.

              11          Q.   Have you ever been -- did anyone

              12  ever tell you that they thought you were a --

              13  dramatic?

              14          A.   Dramatic is not something that

              15  I've ever heard in terms of a description for

              16  myself.

              17          Q.   Did you ever make Dr. Holland

              18  cry?

              19          A.   Oh, no.

              20          Q.   Now, you had mentioned that

              21  billing could affect productivity; is that

              22  correct?

              23          A.   Billing could affect.

              24          Q.   Did -- did -- when -- I'm sorry,

              25  billing could affect -- delayed billing could



                                                               182


               1  affect the bottom line; is that correct?

               2          A.   That is correct.

               3          Q.   Okay.  If a surgeon is double

               4  booking nursing crews, so that one has to go

               5  home, and then another one come in, because a

               6  surgery is taking much longer than

               7  anticipated, does that affect the bottom line

               8  also?

               9          A.   That does not affect our bottom

              10  line for the practice.

              11          Q.   And why is it that it doesn't --

              12  doesn't affect the bottom line for Mercy, the

              13  fact that there is more nursing services being

              14  used for surgery than anticipated?

              15          A.   I can't answer that.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              17  foundation.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) But that

              19  doesn't impact the bottom line for the

              20  practice itself when that occurs, correct?

              21          A.   Correct.

              22          Q.   Just to be clear, you were shown

              23  a series of emails today.  So whenever you

              24  thought there was an issue with Dr. Holland,

              25  you documented it, correct?



                                                               183


               1          A.   Yes, not all of the issues, but

               2  yes, the serious ones.

               3          Q.   And when you thought there was an

               4  issue with Dr. Hashmi, did you ever document

               5  anything?

               6          A.   I don't remember the types of

               7  issues with Dr. Hashmi that Dr. Holland has.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Well, I didn't ask that

               9  part.  I just asked --

              10          A.   Okay.

              11          Q.   -- whether you remember

              12  documenting anything with Dr. Hashmi.

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   Now, Exhibit M, this is the --

              15  this, just to be clear, MSV 4153, this is the

              16  document you pulled out of your notebook, and

              17  then this was marked; is that correct?  The

              18  one where you say --

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   -- remember you were here to

              21  facilitate my patient care?

              22          A.   Uh-huh.

              23          Q.   And -- and you believe that

              24  Dr. Holland attempted to engage in insurance

              25  fraud?



                                                               184


               1          A.   I believe so.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And how many other times

               3  do you think he attempted to engage in

               4  insurance fraud, other than this one time you

               5  believe he tried to engage in it?

               6          A.   Isn't once enough?

               7          Q.   Well, I'm just asking whether or

               8  not you think he engaged in, tried to engage

               9  in insurance fraud on other occasions?

              10          A.   This was the only incident that I

              11  was aware of.

              12          Q.   Now, with regard to insurance

              13  fraud, have you ever heard that Dr. Hashmi

              14  committed insurance fraud by recoding

              15  procedures, so that he would get more billing

              16  credit himself, and then cause the United

              17  States government to pay more money?

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              19          A.   No.

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  -- foundation.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) So you had

              22  never heard anything about surgeons noticing a

              23  pattern of different performed procedures,

              24  versus planned procedures, and they were

              25  inexplicable why those additional procedures



                                                               185


               1  had been coded?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

               3  foundation.

               4          A.   We had this conversation before.

               5          Q.   Yeah.  You never heard anything

               6  about that, right?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   Exhibit N, and there was some

               9  discussion, I asked you about this document

              10  earlier.  I had marked it, but I believe

              11  Mr. Wiencek marked this as well.  This is the

              12  one talking about informing Dr. Holland of his

              13  release.

              14          A.   Correct.

              15          Q.   And I think you said words to the

              16  effect that you had heard this from somewhere.

              17  Where did you hear that he was going to be

              18  released?  From who?

              19          A.   Well, you know, you have these

              20  hallway conversations, and I'm not sure if it

              21  was -- if it was Dr. Hashmi, or if it was

              22  Adam, you know, or Jennifer.  You just have

              23  these conversations, and this conversation

              24  came up more than once in the time that I was

              25  there.



                                                               186


               1             I was hoping that he would get

               2  released early.  This is February 2015, you

               3  know.  I left in February 2016, and he's still

               4  there, but there were talks at different times

               5  of his release from the service agreement.

               6          Q.   Now, on Exhibit M, which is the

               7  text message, whose -- whose phone number is

               8  that, (419) 205-4927?

               9          A.   That's mine.

              10          Q.   So you sent a message from

              11  yourself to yourself?

              12          A.   For documentation.

              13          Q.   Okay.  Now, the first that says

              14  forward:  Dr. Holland, I have instructed the

              15  PAs and the front office to not contact

              16  (blank) and suggest she go to the ER at

              17  St. Anne's with complaints of chest pain to

              18  get admitted for surgery.

              19          A.   Right.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Who did you send that to?

              21          A.   Per -- let's see.  Oh, I sent it

              22  to -- I think I sent it to my email, so that I

              23  would have the documentation.

              24             And then the last part is, the

              25  second text is from Dr. Holland today, so I



                                                               187


               1  was trying to document the phone text to the

               2  email, so that I would have the documentation.

               3          Q.   One second.  I'm checking my

               4  notes.

               5             Do you know who paid Dr. Holland's

               6  pension?

               7          A.   I have no idea.

               8          Q.   Now, you indicated that bills

               9  would be sent to the Toledo Clinic for them to

              10  pay; is that correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   And were you aware or not aware

              13  that monies would be paid from the service

              14  agreement, and then monies would be paid from

              15  the service agreement to Toledo Clinic, and

              16  then from Toledo Clinic to Dr. Holland?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              18  foundation.

              19          A.   That is not -- I wasn't at that

              20  level, so no, I wasn't aware.

              21          Q.   The -- there is some testimony.

              22  I don't know if it's still in front of you.

              23  You got three pages of testimony you were

              24  shown, pages 293, 411 and 451.

              25          A.   Correct.



                                                               188


               1          Q.   Okay.  Now, you were asked about

               2  certain portions of answers, is that right?

               3  Certain -- certain lines --

               4          A.   Yes.

               5          Q.   -- on these pages?

               6             All right.  Now, at the top of page

               7  293, you see that Dr. Holland is testifying

               8  about what Dr. Hashmi told him about the

               9  reason Burdine was not getting referrals,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   Okay.  Yes.

              12          Q.   And then the next paragraph is

              13  Dr. Holland talking about what Dr. Burdine

              14  told him, correct?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   And then the next paragraph is

              17  where Dr. -- Dr. Holland is mentioning

              18  Dr. Burdine writing a letter, correct?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   And this has to do with that --

              21  do you see how it's referring to how consults

              22  are coming into the practice and being

              23  distributed?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Okay.  So at least as to page



                                                               189


               1  293, when read, the rest of the page was read

               2  in context, there is other discussion here

               3  about Dr. Burdine's memo and the issue of

               4  referrals, correct?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               6          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Is that right?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   Now, on the next page that you

               9  looked at, page 411.  And then at the bottom

              10  of the page, there is extra lines.  There are

              11  three additional lines after what Mr. Wiencek

              12  didn't read.  And then line 24, the bottom of

              13  the page, it says conversations with

              14  Dr. Burdine, who actually went through the

              15  call referral records.  Do you see that?

              16          A.   I do.

              17          Q.   Okay.  So Dr. Holland refers to

              18  conversations with you and also Dr. Burdine on

              19  this page, correct?

              20          A.   He does.

              21          Q.   Okay.  The next page you were

              22  given is page 451.

              23          A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.

              24          Q.   And you see at the top of the

              25  page, it appears that Dr. Holland is referring



                                                               190


               1  to conversation with Dr. Burdine and

               2  Dr. -- and Mr. Carruthers?

               3          A.   I do.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Or speaking to both of

               5  them.

               6             You don't know whether or not

               7  Dr. Holland actually did have such

               8  conversations with Dr. Burdine, because you

               9  weren't present for them, correct?

              10          A.   Correct.

              11          Q.   And you don't know if he had such

              12  conversations with Adam Carruthers, because

              13  you weren't present for those either, correct?

              14          A.   Correct.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And then -- and then at

              16  the bottom of page 451, do you see how

              17  Dr. Holland is referring to, I personally hand

              18  presented this letter to Mr. Arquilla on

              19  January, on or around January 20th of 2014.

              20  Correct?

              21          A.   Correct.

              22          Q.   And you don't know anything about

              23  that meeting, or what occurred in it, correct?

              24          A.   I do not.

              25          Q.   Were you ever told that



                                                               191


               1  Mr. Arquilla said, after he was presented data

               2  about Dr. Hashmi and that the referral

               3  statistics seemed skewed, that he told

               4  Dr. Holland that if he was unhappy, he would

               5  serve as a referral for him?  Did you ever

               6  hear anything like that?

               7          A.   I did not.

               8          Q.   That's all I have.  Thank you.

               9          A.   You're welcome.

              10                    RE-EXAMINATION

              11  BY MR. WIENCEK:

              12          Q.   You mentioned that -- that Adam

              13  might have informed you that Dr. Holland might

              14  be potentially released?

              15          A.   It -- it could have been.  I

              16  mean, there is so many conversations.  People

              17  talk, people gossip, you know, so it could

              18  have come from Adam.

              19          Q.   Did Adam Carruthers ever complain

              20  about Dr. Holland to you?

              21          A.   He did.  He complained about

              22  everybody and everything, but he did complain,

              23  you know, he complained about Dr. Holland too.

              24          Q.   But you said that you felt -- I

              25  thought you said you felt earlier that Adam



                                                               192


               1  and Dr. Holland had an excellent relationship?

               2          A.   Well, Adam would -- would change,

               3  you know?  He would change alliances with

               4  whoever he thought would protect him best, so

               5  Adam is a pathological liar.  So you know, he

               6  can be buddies with you one minute, and then

               7  backstab you the next.  So for a while, he

               8  liked Holland, for a while he didn't like

               9  Holland, so it could go either way with him.

              10          Q.   Would it surprise you, earlier

              11  Jennifer Haaser testified that she had a

              12  conversation with him, where he was very

              13  critical of Dr. Holland.  Would that be

              14  surprising to you?

              15          A.   No.

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object.

              17          A.   It wouldn't surprise me at all.

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              19          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Would that be

              20  consistent with your experience with

              21  Mr. Carruthers?

              22          A.   That would be consistent --

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              24          A.   -- with Adam.

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               193


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Jason, do you have

               2  anything else?

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  I have nothing

               4  further.

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  We're done.  I'll

               6  take a copy.  She'll read.

              17             I do hereby acknowledge that the above

              18  and foregoing deposition has been submitted to me.

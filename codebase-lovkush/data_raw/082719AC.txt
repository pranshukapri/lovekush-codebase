            7    A.      I mean, I knew it was something that was

            8    probably going to happen but we didn't really talk

           10    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      10




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   So when I said did you review any

            3    documents --

            4    A.      Yeah, but I didn't review -- you're asking

            5    before I came here so no, but when this all took place,

                                                                      14

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   MR. BARSKY:  Michael, if you don't

            7    mind, I'm just going to amend your instructions.  When

            8    you're asked a question do your best not to guess.

            9    You're allowed to approximate but if you do have to

           10    guess the record will reflect that is your honest

           11    belief of the answer to the question.  So if a guess is

           12    being offered just make sure that you either say this

           13    is a guess or I don't know.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  Okay.

           15                   MR. FROEHLICH:  That's good advice.

           16    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           17    Q.      Are you associated with a license real estate

           18    broker?

           19    A.      I am.

           20    Q.      And which license real estate broker are you

           21    associated with?

           22    A.      Keller Williams.

           23    Q.      Is that a Keller Williams office in New

           24    Jersey?

                                                                      15




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      Are you familiar with Washington Realty

            3    Partners, LLC in Sewell, New Jersey?

            4    A.      Yeah, I believe that might be the office of

            5    that, that's a guess.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Have you ever been associated with any

            8    other licensed real estate broker?

            9    A.      I was briefly when I first got my license but

           10    they were like a small time thing and I think they

           11    might have even went out of business so I had to change

           12    my license over.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   Have you kept your real estate

           15    salesperson license active since July of 2016?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      Prior to obtaining your real estate

           18    salesperson license did you take any real estate

           19    classes?

           20    A.      Of course.

           21    Q.      And these were classes -- were these classes

           22    that were required in order to get your real estate

           23    salesperson license in New Jersey?

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                      16




            1    Q.      Since you become a licensed real estate

            2    salesperson have you kept up with your annual

            3    education requirements?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      Other than holding a real estate salesperson

            6    license in New Jersey do you hold any other state

            7    licenses in any other states?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      Have you ever faced any investigations or

           10    disciplinary actions by the New Jersey Real Estate

           11    Commission?

           12    A.      No.

           13    Q.      So typically at this part of the deposition I

           14    ask the deponent where they work and they respond and

           15    it's a very simple question.  It sounds like this might

           16    be a little bit more complicated because am I correct

           17    in saying that you have income from several different

           18    sources?

           19    A.      No, I mean other than my rental properties I

           20    don't -- I mean, that's my only other income.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   So we're going to do the different

           23    sources step by step.

           24    A.      Okay.

                                                                      17




            1    Q.      You mentioned rental properties.  How many

            2    rental properties do you own?

            3    A.      5.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   And are all of the rental properties in

            6    the name of Capp Investments, LLC?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      And all of those properties are in

            9    Philadelphia County?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      Do you receive any other income other than the

           12    income from your rental properties?

           13    A.      Do you mean do I make any other income?

           14    Q.      Yes.

           15    A.      Sure.

           16    Q.      And what is the source of that other income?

           17    A.      Wholesaling.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   When you say wholesaling what do you

           20    mean by that?

           21    A.      In wholesaling real estate it's typically

           22    getting properties a little below market value and

           23    either, you know, buying them to rent, fix up or flip

           24    or wholesaling to another investor.

                                                                      18




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Is wholesaling different than flipping

            3    a property in your understanding?

            4    A.      No.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   So when you say wholesaling you also

            7    mean somebody who -- well, correct me if I'm wrong,

            8    when I think of flipping I think of somebody who

            9    purchases a property, they have a record or equitable

           10    ownership in it, they do something to it, they sell it?

           11    A.      Right.

           12    Q.      Can we agree that that's the general

           13    definition of flipping?

           14    A.      Sure.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   So when I use the word -- when I say

           17    flipping in this deposition that's what I'm referring

           18    to.

           19    A.      Yes.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   And when I think of wholesaling I think

           22    of somebody who purchases the right to buy that

           23    property but then sells or assigns that right to a

           24    third party but never actually becomes the record

                                                                      19




            1    owner?

            2    A.      Correct.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Can we agree that that's -- so when I

            5    say wholesaling that's going to be what I refer to?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      So do you make income from both wholesaling

            8    and flipping as I've defined those terms?

            9    A.      Yes.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Are you associated with any business or

           12    organization as a wholesaler or flipper?

           13    A.      I don't understand the question.

           14    Q.      Are you aware of Problem Property Pals?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      What is Problem Property Pals?

           17    A.      It's a company that helps motivate its sellers

           18    that are in a position that need to sell their

           19    property.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   And do you work with Problem Property

           22    Pals?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      And in what capacity do you work with Problem

                                                                      20




            1    Property Pals?

            2    A.      An acquisition manager.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   And what are your job responsibilities

            5    as the acquisition manager with Problem Property Pals

            6    -- PPP?

            7    A.      To meet sellers at their property, discuss

            8    kind of what their goals and their outcomes are and to

            9    come to an agreement based on their goals and their

           10    outcomes and get a property under contract and then

           11    move forward there.

            1                   MR. BARSKY:  Objection to the form, you

            2    can answer.

            3                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Hold on, sir --

            4                   MR. BARSKY:  You're asking him to

            5    speculate as to what another company knows and that's

            6    not fair, that's my objection.

            7                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Okay, my question is

            8    are you going to be making objections?

            9                   MR. BARSKY:  As of right now it looks

           12    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           13    Q.      Let me rephrase the question.

           14                   Did you tell Keller Williams that you

           15    have Capp Investments, LLC?

           16    A.      Why would I need to do that?  Why would I need

           17    to do that?  I don't understand like your question.

           18    I'm an independent contractor with them.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   So the answer is yes you have told

           21    them?

           22    A.      No, why would I need to do that, no.

           23    Q.      No, okay.

           24                   Do you have a written agreement with

            1    Keller Williams?

            2    A.      Yes, that hangs my license there.  But I

            3    conventionally do no real estate through Keller

            4    Williams.  I have not sold a conventional piece of real

            5    estate ever.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   In the agreement that you have with

            8    Keller Williams does it require you to inform them of

            9    your involvement in other businesses?

           10    A.      That I don't know.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12    A.      I don't have the agreement in front of me, I

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   How did you learn how to be a

           16    wholesaler?

           17    A.      How did I learn how to be a wholesaler, just

            2    Q.      REIA --

            3    A.      REIA groups like South Jersey Real Estate

            4    groups.  I believe the one -- I forget the one in

            5    Philadelphia but just personal -- private meet ups like

            6    real estate investors.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   How long have you been associated with

            9    PPP?

           13    were you associated with anybody else as a wholesaler?

           14    A.      No.

           15    Q.      Would it be accurate to say that your work as

           16    a wholesaler began when you joined with PPP?

           17    A.      No.

           18    Q.      Why is that inaccurate?

           19    A.      Because I was doing it on my own.

           20    Q.      I see.

           21    A.      But wasn't affiliated with anybody.

           22    Q.      I understand.  I should have been more

            4    you stated that you incorporated Capp Investments, LLC,

            5    so if I'm doing my math right that means that prior to

            6    your association with PPP Capp Investments did not

            7    exist; is that correct?

            8    A.      No, the two are unrelated though.

            9    Q.      What I was getting at is when you were acting

           10    as a wholesaler prior to your association with PPP were

           12    A.      No, no, let me be clear, I was doing it on my

           13    own for 6 months without any success, so to speak.

           21    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           22    Q.      We just went off the record for a brief moment

           23    so that I could apologize for the facilities.

           24                   Other than the people that we've talked

                                                                      41




            1    about, Mr. Cappello, is there anybody else that works

            2    at Problem Property Pals?

            3    A.      Not that I know of.

            5                   Does Jonathan Delp work at Problem

           11    Q.      And when he did work at Problem Property Pals

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   On the website of Problem Property Pals

           18    it lists your title as Professional House Buyer.  And

           19    it lists Antwon Daniels' title as Acquisitions Manager.

           20    What is the difference between a Professional House

           21    Buyer and an Acquisitions Manager?

           22    A.      I don't know why that was said that way.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24    A.      I mean, we're -- I have a background in

                                                                      42




            1    construction so maybe that's why, I don't know.

            3                   Does Problem Property Pals have an

           10    A.      2 years.

           11    Q.      According to documents -- I can represent to

           12    you that according to documents with the State it was

           13    incorporated at 37 Waterford Way, Wallingford,

           14    Pennsylvania.

           15                   Are you familiar with the address 37

           22    owner of any properties in its own name?

           23    A.      I wouldn't know that.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      43




            1                   Does Problem Property Pals have a bank

            2    account?

            3    A.      I wouldn't know that.

            4    Q.      Does Problem Property Pals ever pay

            5    contractors or vendors that you've seen?

            6    A.      I'm not privy to like the operational stuff

            7    like that.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Do you know who pays the rent for

           10    Problem Property Pals?

           11    A.      I don't know, no.

           12    Q.      Do you know who pays the utility bills and

           13    other costs of doing business?

           14    A.      No, sir.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Do you know whether Problem Property

           17    Pals has been incorporated as an LLC with the State of

           23    A.      I don't know.

           24    Q.      Do you know if Problem Property Pals has ever

                                                                      44




            1    paid Local or State or Federal income tax?

            2    A.      I'm not sure.

            3    Q.      Can you describe for me what Problem Property

            4    Pals does on behalf of the Philadelphia Cash Buyer Land

            5    Trust?

            6    A.      I would imagine that's it like and I'm

            7    guessing here.  I would imagine it's a marketing, like

            8    I said, umbrella marketing to motivate its sellers that

            9    need to sell their property.  That would be my guess as

           10    to what that does.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   Who trained you to do the work that you

           13    do at Problem Property Pals?

           14    A.      I really didn't have any training.

           15    Q.      Who told you to use this standard agreement to

           16    sell real estate?

           17    A.      It was the one given to me by George.

           18    Q.      Do you know who drafted the standard agreement

           19    to sell real estate?

           20    A.      I don't.

           21    Q.      Did you draft the standard agreement to sell

           22    real estate?

           23    A.      I did not.

           24    Q.      On the agreement that was given to you by

                                                                      45




            1    George did it include the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust

            2    and/or assigns as the buyer?

            3    A.      Meaning was it in there already?

            4    Q.      Yes.

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Did you ever ask George why the Philly

            8    Cash Buyer Land Trust was listed as the buyer?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      And what is your understanding about why the

           11    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust is listed as the buyer?

           12    A.      I wouldn't know.  I'm not a lawyer.

           13    Q.      When you go to visit the house of a potential

           14    seller are you acting on behalf of Problem Property

           15    Pals?

           16    A.      Yeah, I would think so.  But again, it's the

           17    marketing umbrella.  So as far as like company

           18    structure from there I don't know.  But they're getting

           19    marketed to buy Problem Property Pals.  So essentially

           20    that's the way it may look.  But as far as corporate

           21    structure I don't know where that goes from there like

           22    how it's set up or why.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   Has Problem Property Pals ever acted as

                                                                      46




            1    the marketing umbrella, using your term, for an entity

            2    other than the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust?

            3    A.      I don't know.

            4    Q.      Have you ever signed a standard agreement to

            5    sell real estate on behalf of somebody other than the

            6    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust in connection with your

            7    work with PPP?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      When you first started at PPP 2 years ago was

           10    this the same standard agreement to sell real estate

           11    that you were using 2 years ago?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      Has the standard agreement to sell real estate

           14    ever changed in the 2 years that you were working with

           15    PPP?

           16    A.      No.

           17    Q.      Does PPP ever acquire properties in its own

           18    name?

           19                   MR. SCATENA:  You already asked that,

           20    Counsel.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  I don't know that.

           22    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           23    Q.      Earlier you testified or you stated that you

           24    were authorized to sign the agreement to sell real

                                                                      47




            1    estate on behalf of the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust.

            2    Who gave you that authorization?

            3    A.      George Beatty.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   Has George Beatty authorized you to

            6    sign any other documents on behalf of the Philly Cash

            7    Buyer Land Trust?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      How do potential sellers know about PPP?

           10                   MR. BARSKY:  Objection to form.

           11    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           12    Q.      Do potential sellers call PPP?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      How do potential sellers get the phone number

           15    for PPP?

           16    A.      Marketing.

           17    Q.      And what type of marketing does PPP do to

           18    potential sellers?

           19    A.      Direct mail, Facebook advertising.  I'm sure

           20    Google stuff, Google ads and stuff.

           21    Q.      Whose responsibility at PPP is it to do direct

           22    mail?

           23    A.      George Beatty's I'm guessing.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      48




            1                   Do you send the direct mail from PPP?

            2    A.      No.

            3    Q.      All right.

            4                   Whose responsibility is it to do the

            5    Facebook advertisements?

            6    A.      I would guess George Beatty.

            7    Q.      Do you do the Facebook advertisements?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      And whose responsibility is it to do the

           10    Google advertisements?

           11    A.      I would assume George Beatty I'm guessing.

           12    Q.      Have you ever seen the direct mail that PPP

           13    sends out?

           14    A.      Yes.

           18                       - - -

           19    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           20    Q.      Mr. Cappello, I'm handing you what's been

           21    marked for identification purposes as D-2.  If you can

           22    take a minute to take a look at it.

           23    A.      Uh-huh.

           24    Q.      Do you recognize this document?

                                                                      49




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      And what is this document?

            3    A.      This is our letter that goes out to people

            4    that may be interesting in selling a property.

            5    Q.      Now, this letter in the upper right-hand

            6    corner is dated July 16th, 2018.  Is PPP still sending

            7    this letter to potential sellers?

            8    A.      I don't know if it's changed or if is the same

            9    one.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   And the phone number that's listed is

           12    (267) 244-1766?

           13    A.      Uh-huh.

           14    Q.      Whose phone number is that?

           15    A.      That I'm not sure of.  I'm not sure if it

           16    comes into our answering service.  We have some kind of

           17    answering service so...

           18    Q.      All right.

           19                   When a potential seller is interested

           20    in selling their house and they call that number what

           21    happens next?

           22    A.      Well, if somebody is there it gets picked up

           23    either -- probably Angela or if it's like off hours it

           24    probably goes into some kind of answering service.

                                                                      50




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   And when you say Angela you mean --

            3    A.      Angela White, yes.

            4    Q.      So does PPP have an answering service to

            5    receive phone calls after hours?

            6    A.      I'm not sure of that.  I don't know if it goes

            7    into like an answering machine answering service or if

            8    it's like a live person.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   So after a potential seller calls

           11    Angela how are you made aware of the potential seller?

           12    A.      Well, Angela what she does is she has a

           13    conversation with the seller.  She makes sure that

           14    we're a fit and that the seller is really interested in

           15    selling his property.  She goes over how the

           16    appointment is going to go exactly step by step.  What

           17    I'm going to do when I get to the appointment.  They

           18    get a confirmation text before I go to the appointment.

           19    But we don't run any appointments unless the people are

           20    absolutely a fit for us and the property is a fit.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   And how do you define whether the

           23    person and the property is a fit for us?

           24    A.      Well, the property being that it's typically

                                                                      51




            1    in disrepair.  They can't put it on the market because

            2    it's in disrepair.  The person being -- they don't want

            3    to work with a realtor.  They don't want to go through

            4    the hassle of fixing anything up.  They don't want to

            5    -- they want to alleviate the realtor closing cost,

            6    that kind of stuff.  And they want an easy quick 30, 45

            7    day settlement to qualify.

            8    Q.      Have you ever taken one of those calls when

            9    the potential seller has called in?

           10    A.      No, but I have -- not for Problem Property but

           11    I fielded calls from motivated sellers, yes.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Have you ever observed or listened in

           14    while Angela is taking one of these calls?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      Can you recall some of the specific questions

           17    that she asks the caller in order to determine whether

           18    the caller is a good fit for Problem Property Pals?

           19    A.      Well, the obvious ones would be for the house,

           20    condition, any repairs made, any upgrades that have

           21    been made in the last 10 or 15 years.  Kind of why

           22    they're selling, why they aren't going with a realtor.

           23    She tells them or explains to them the difference

           24    between realtor versus selling to an investor and that

                                                                      52




            1    kind of stuff.

            2    Q.      What is the difference between -- how does

            3    Angela tell a caller the difference between a realtor

            4    and an investor?

            5    A.      So she would probably mention something like

            6    -- and again, this isn't verbatim but something along

            7    the lines of with a realtor you may have to paint the

            8    place, you may have to clean the place out, you may

            9    have to -- you're going to pay the 6 percent

           10    commission, you're going to pay your own closing cost

           11    and transfer tax, it may take 3 to 6 months to sell it.

           12    As opposed to an investor where it's 30 to 45 days,

           13    there's no clean out, we're also going to pay your

           14    closing cost and transfer tax, it's an easy sale, we

           15    handle the transaction.  That's probably how it's

           16    explained.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   If Angela determines that a local

           19    seller is a good fit how does she pass that information

           20    on to you?

           21    A.      It gets -- it's all put in the PODIO and then

           22    she creates an appointment in PODIO and then I get an

           23    appointment notification and so on.

           24    Q.      Uh-huh, typically, how much time passes

                                                                      53




            1    between the call from the potential seller and your

            2    appointment with them?

            3    A.      I'm sorry, say that again.

            4    Q.      Sure, typically, how much time passes between

            5    the call to Angela and the appointment that you have to

            6    go out to talk to a potential seller?

            7    A.      Meaning how much time passes before my

            8    appointment is scheduled.

            9    Q.      Like one day, two days?

           10    A.      Yeah, usually it's the next day or within that

           11    week.  We try not to schedule too far out.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   And does Angela make those

           14    appointments?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      What information do you receive from Angela

           17    regarding the appointment?

           18    A.      Everything that was talked about on the call.

           19    She footnotes the call.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21    A.      Seller's asking price, what they're looking

           22    for, kind of what their driving force is, whether it's

           23    they need relocation, stuff like that.

           24    Q.      Does Angela ask the caller what their asking

                                                                      54




            1    price is on the phone?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      And Angela enters this information in PODIO?

            4    A.      Yes, for the most part.  She may forget to do

            5    that but for the most part she gets a range.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Do you recall the field name in PODIO

            8    where she enters this information?

            9    A.      Deal notes if that's what you're looking for?

           10                   I feel like you know the answers to

           11    these questions you're just trying to ask me.

           12    Q.      I know the answer to many questions.

           13    A.      Deal notes is that the field name you're

           14    looking for.

           15    Q.      I never used PODIO before.  I only learned

           16    about it yesterday?

           17    A.      It would be deal notes.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   So we talked about direct mail.  You

           20    mentioned Facebook advertisements and Google ads.  Does

           21    PPP use any other methods of marketing?

           22    A.      I don't know.  They're the ones that I know

           23    of.

           24    Q.      Does PPP use the signs on the public ways?

                                                                      55




            1    A.      I don't know.

            2    Q.      Does PPP use post-it notes on doors?

            3                   MR. BARSKY:  Objection to form, you can

            4    answer.

            5                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Let me try and restate

            6    it.

            7    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            8    Q.      Are you familiar with the marketing tactic

            9    where companies such as PPP have prewritten post-its

           10    that they adhere to doors of potential houses?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Does PPP use this type of marketing?

           13    A.      I don't know.

           14    Q.      Does PPP use door hangers?

           15    A.      I don't know.  The ones that I stated are the

           16    ones that I know that we use.  I don't know if there's

           17    any --

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   I want to show you a door hanger.  But

           20    before we enter it into the record let me just say --

           21    let me just ask you are you familiar -- this is the

           22    original -- are you familiar with this door hanger?

           23    A.      No, I never seen that.

           24    Q.      Okay, then that's fine.

                                                                      56




            1    A.      Interesting, his name is spelled wrong but...

            2    Q.      Are you familiar with the phone number (267)

            3    233-6697?

            4    A.      No, it might be one of our smart phone numbers

            5    or something to the answering service.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   When Angela receives a phone call from

            8    a potential seller does she record that call in PODIO?

            9    A.      I believe we do, yeah.

           10    Q.      If Angela is unable for whatever reason to

           11    schedule an appointment with a seller will you receive

           12    a referral for that phone call?

           13    A.      No, she'll follow-up, you know, if there's

           14    something she thinks we can connect on she'll follow up

           15    until she can get an appointment set up.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Approximately how many appointments do

           18    you get from PPP every week?

           19    A.      It varies.  It would be 3 one week.  It could

           20    be 6 the next week.  It varies.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22    A.      But I would say 3 to 10.

           23    Q.      And what portion of those referrals for

           24    appointments are in Philadelphia County?

                                                                      57




            1    A.      What percentage?

            2    Q.      Right.

            3    A.      We do stuff in all the counties -- surrounding

            4    counties.  So I would say it's probably split evenly,

            5    you know, 30 percent around, give or take on any given

            6    month.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   And how does Angela decide who gets the

            9    appointment?

           10    A.      It's a round robin.  The system does it.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   Sorry, we talked over each other so I

           13    got to ask the question again, but...

           14    A.      Go ahead.

           15    Q.      How does Angela decide who gets the

           16    appointment you or Antwon Daniels?

           17    A.      The system does it.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   Does Angela schedule appointments for

           20    anybody else other than you and Antwon Daniels as of

           21    this week?

           22    A.      No.

           23    Q.      When you get the referral from Angela what

           24    type of research do you do before you go to the house?

                                                                      58




            1    A.      I run comps on the property, comparable sales

            2    in the area in the condition that it's in.

            3    Q.      What resources do you consult in order to run

            4    comps?

            5    A.      Bright MLS which is the multiple listing

            6    service.

            7    Q.      Do you use any other sources to run the comps?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      And do you do any other research other than

           10    using Bright MLS to get the comps?

           11    A.      No, you don't need to do anything else.  It's

           12    where realtors list and sell their properties.  Any

           13    comparable sale is going to be in that.

           14    Q.      Do you do anything to confirm that the caller

           15    is the record owner of the property?

           16    A.      Yes, Angela does that when she's on the phone

           17    she looks up public record to make sure.

           18    Q.      Do you do anything to confirm whether there's

           19    a water lien on the property?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      What do you do in order to confirm that

           22    there's a water lien on the property?

           23    A.      She asks them.  And then once it's inputted

           24    into the system it gets updated through -- you know, we

                                                                      59




            1    have a VA that updates the system.  So they'll go on

            2    the County website or whether it's the tax website or

            3    whatever and they'll input tax debt and water debt.

            4    Q.      Do you do any of that?

            5    A.      No.

            6    Q.      Do you check for any mortgage liens on the

            7    property?

            8    A.      We try to in Trend but it's not always

            9    accurate in Bright.  We ask them.  We take their word

           10    for what they tell us.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12    A.      But you can't really tell because it's

           13    inaccurate in Bright.

           14    Q.      At what point do you decide what price PPP is

           15    willing to offer for this property?

           16    A.      Based on the comparable sales and then

           17    obviously I have to walk the property and the amount of

           18    work that it needs.  That's how the offer is made.

           19    It's dependent on the condition, area and sales in the

           20    area.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   Are you authorized by George Beatty to

           23    come up with your own offer price?

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                      60




            1    Q.      Does that authorization have limits?

            2    A.      No -- limits as far as what?

            3    Q.      Could you offer to purchase the property for

            4    three times its fair market value?

            5    A.      No, I have to obviously purchase the property

            6    where the comps make sense in order for us to do the

            7    rehab or an investor to do the rehab.

            8    Q.      So has George Beatty provided you with any

            9    explicit restrictions on your authorization as to how

           10    much to offer the price?

           11    A.      No, he trusts my judgement.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Once you arrive at a property and you

           14    have the conversation with the potential seller and

           15    inspect the property do you need to check with anybody

           16    to get approval before you make the offer?

           17    A.      No, I do not.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   Does Antwon Daniels need to get

           20    approval?

           21    A.      No, he does not.

           22    Q.      Okay, all right.

           23                   So I want to walk through the process

           24    that you take --

                                                                      61




            1                   THE WITNESS:  Can I use the bathroom.

            2                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Of course, absolutely.

            3                       - - -

            4                   (Whereupon, a brief break was taken at

            5    this time.)

            6                       - - -

            7    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            8    Q.      So we're just back from a quick break.

            9                   And we had been talking about how you

           10    review comps prior to going to the house.

           11    A.      Uh-huh.

           12    Q.      Going into a visit do you have in mind what

           13    you want as your goal appraisal fee?

           14    A.      No.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   If you have determined that a house is

           17    worth say $50,000 --

           18    A.      Uh-huh.

           19    Q.      I imagine that you would not offer $50,000,

           20    correct?

           21    A.      No.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Would you offer $49,000?

           24    A.      If that's where I need to get a deal, yes.

                                                                      62




            1    Q.      So you would accept projected appraisal fees

            2    of as little as a thousand dollars?

            3    A.      Not typically.  I mean, you're probably likely

            4    between 5 and 10 I would say.

            5    Q.      So going into the transaction your goal

            6    appraisal fee is at least $5,000?

            7    A.      Let me ask you something.

            8    Q.      Sure.

            9    A.      You're buying a house, right, they're listed

           10    on the market for $229,000.  Are you going in at

           11    $229,000?

           12    Q.      Of course not.

           13    A.      Same thing, it's no different.

           14    Q.      However, what I'm asking these questions is

           15    for sometimes -- I imagine that in wholesaling

           16    sometimes the deal is just not worth it?

           17    A.      Of course.

           18    Q.      So my questions are going to this -- at what

           19    value is the deal just not worth it?

           20    A.      I would say we want to be between 5 and 7 --

           21    $5,000 to $10,000.

           22    Q.      Or $20,000, right?

           23    A.      If it happens like that, yes.

           24    Q.      But the goal is at least 5?

                                                                      63




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      I don't want to put words in your mouth.  But

            3    it sounds like the goal is at least --

            4    A.      Yeah, I won't sign anything if we're going to

            5    make less than $5,000.  It's just the operational cost

            6    is probably too much to do that.

            7    Q.      So you arrive at the property at the scheduled

            8    time.  What's the -- walk me through the process, what

            9    happens?

           10    A.      So we arrive, well, obviously we introduce

           11    ourselves.  I talk a little bit about like what kind of

           12    -- what his goals are, what his outcomes are.  Like how

           13    soon he's looking to settle, you know, if he's

           14    interested -- kind of just warm up with him just to

           15    kind of see where they're at and what they want to do.

           16    Because even though it's qualified there's times that I

           17    could still walk in and it still not be qualified,

           18    right.  So I want to make sure that we're a fit, the

           19    property is a fit before we have any discussion on

           20    price.

           21    Q.      You mean qualified by Angela?

           22    A.      Yes, stating she went over all of that with

           23    the person.  We get to the house I want to make sure

           24    that, you know, things are what they are.  Once that's

                                                                      64




            1    done they take me on a tour.  I snap some photos.  I

            2    talk about kind of like what would be done in the

            3    property, kind of what's needed, that kind of stuff,

            4    kind of see what their expectations are and what their

            5    -- if they're being logical and what needs to be done

            6    and what doesn't need to be done.  And then once that

            7    happens, you know, I'll make him a non-obligational

            8    offer.

            9    Q.      A non-obligational offer?

           10    A.      Uh-huh.

           11    Q.      During that initial conversation do you tell

           12    them about your experience with construction?

           13    A.      I do.

           14    Q.      Do you tell them that you're a licensed real

           15    estate salesperson in New Jersey?

           16    A.      I do.

           17    Q.      Do you tell them that you're representing the

           18    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust?

           19    A.      No.

           20    Q.      Do you tell them you're representing Problem

           21    Property Pals?

           22    A.      I don't tell them anything.  They get a

           23    confirmation text from us.  I mean, if they ask me for

           24    a card I give them a card.  I don't say that I'm -- you

                                                                      65




            1    know, I don't walk in with a flag saying I'm from PPP.

            2    Q.      On the confirmation text does it say that it's

            3    from PPP?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      And the card that you give them does it also

            6    say PPP?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      At what point do you talk about price during

            9    that initial visit?

           10    A.      After I look at the property and ask him, hey,

           11    what are you looking to get from the property.  I'm up

           12    front with people.  I ask them what they're trying to

           13    get.  And if can do that price I'll do it.  If I can't

           14    I'm going to say here, this is where I need to be and

           15    then we'll have a conversation about it at that point.

           16    Q.      Obviously, price is negotiable.  Are there

           17    other terms on the agreement of sale that are

           18    negotiable?

           19    A.      Typically, I'll change the -- or I'll cross

           20    out the agreement of sale because I pay their closing

           21    costs and transfer tax.

           22    Q.      There's a part on the agreement of sale that

           23    talks about the cash deposit?

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                      66




            1    Q.      Is that negotiable?

            2    A.      Sure.

            3    Q.      Have you ever agreed to say $5,000 per

            4    deposit?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      On the agreement of sale there's a place that

            7    says when this closing is going to happen?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Is that time period negotiable?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      What's the farthest out that you'll go?

           12    A.      Typically, you don't want to go longer than 2

           13    months but we have in the past.  Because market can

           14    change in that amount of time, you know, longer than 5,

           15    6 months.  But I have done it longer than two.  But

           16    typically, we don't try to go out further than two.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   What's the shortest period that you'll

           19    schedule a closing?

           20    A.      I try not to do anything shorter than 30 to 45

           21    days just because in the City of Philadelphia it takes

           22    3 weeks to get title and stuff cleared, pay-offs and

           23    that kind of stuff so...

           24    Q.      On the Agreement of Sale there's a place where

                                                                      67




            1    you can write in a date by which acceptance has to be

            2    made?

            3    A.      Yes.

            4    Q.      Is that negotiable?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Have you negotiated agreements of sale

            8    where the acceptance date was more than 3 days out?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Under what circumstances would you --

           11    A.      We want to review the paperwork or, you know,

           12    I want to have my lawyer look over it, that kind of

           13    stuff.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   How often do you agree to negotiate

           16    that date?

           17    A.      Whenever it's asked for.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   On the standard agreement to sell real

           20    estate there's also a place to indicate a title company

           21    --

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      -- and if you want to look at D-1 this is

           24    Paragraph 2 (ii); is the title company negotiable?

                                                                      68




            1    A.      It's buyer's right to title company so that's

            2    not negotiable.  But we do use a couple different title

            3    companies just because we do so much volume.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   Other than Prosperity Abstract what

            6    other title companies have you used in the last say 3

            7    months?

            8    A.      3 months it's been Prosperity Abstract mostly

            9    just because they get our stuff back the quickest.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Once you agree upon a price and then at

           12    that point do you provide them with the Agreement of

           13    Sale?

           14    A.      They have the Agreement of Sale right there.

           15    I go over it line for line.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Tell me about that, when you say line

           18    for line do you read it out loud to them?

           19    A.      Yes, line for line.  I hand my Agreement of

           20    Sale.  I say -- because obviously people are

           21    apprehensive when you're doing a transaction like that.

           22    I say, hey, this is just a simple Agreement of Sale.

           23    I'm going to go over it with you.  Once it's all filled

           24    out and we okay everything I'm going to scan it into my

                                                                      69




            1    phone and you will have this copy.  And then I go line

            2    for line, this is what it says, this is what this

            3    paragraph means, yada, yada, yada.

            4    Q.      If you can take a look at paragraph 7, it's on

            5    Page 2 where it says assignable, buyer may assign this

            6    contract?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      How do describe this paragraph to the

            9    potential seller?

           10    A.      So I tell them that I'm going to sign it in my

           11    name.  It's probably going to be another LLC or another

           12    entity that actually takes ownership of the property

           13    and then I'll sign it to that LLC or owner.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Do you explain why it may be in another

           16    LLC?

           17    A.      Sometimes I do for liability purposes.

           18    Q.      What does that mean liability purposes?

           19    A.      I mean, if you own a rental name in your

           20    private name and somebody slips and falls my assets are

           21    liable.  So that's why stuff gets put in an LLC because

           22    you have protection from your personal assets.

           23    Q.      I see.

           24                   Do you describe to the potential seller

                                                                      70




            1    why -- well, other than what you just said do you say

            2    anything more about Paragraph 7, assignable?

            3    A.      No.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   In Paragraph 9 it says evidence of

            6    title.  I'll just read this really quickly.  It says

            7    within 5 days from the date hereof buyer at buyer's

            8    sole cost and expense shall cause a title insurance

            9    company to issue and deliver an ALTA form title

           10    commitment accompanied by one company of all documents

           11    effecting the property in which constitute acceptance

           12    to the title commitment.

           13                   To your knowledge does the Philly Cash

           14    Buyer Land Trust cause a title insurance company to do

           15    this within 5 days?

           16    A.      So I believe this is a request that title was

           17    pulled, yes, it's done.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   And who --

           20    A.      That paragraph states we have to pull title

           21    within 5 days.

           22    Q.      And when you say we who pulls the title?

           23    A.      It would be Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      71




            1                   Do you know which individual at Philly

            2    Cash Buyer Land Trust pulls the title or requests the

            3    title report?

            4    A.      It would be Kayla requesting to have title

            5    pulled.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Paragraph 11 says place of closing.

            8    Closing shall be held at buyer elected title company or

            9    107 South 2nd Street, Third Floor, Philadelphia,

           10    Pennsylvania 19106.

           11    A.      Uh-huh.

           12    Q.      Where are the closings usually held?

           13    A.      It's either or.  I would say 50 percent at our

           14    office and 50 percent at the buyer.  Or if it's a

           15    seller that's too far away we kind of meet them, you

           16    know, up where they're at.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   And then on the next page, Paragraph

           19    14, Expenses.  Earlier you stated that you typically --

           20    I think the word you used was typically.  Typically

           21    offer to pay all closing costs and transfers.  So

           22    that's what we're looking at here?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      72




            1                   Are there circumstances in which you do

            2    not offer to pay closing costs and transfer?

            3    A.      Yes.

            4    Q.      And under what circumstances might you not

            5    offer to pay closing costs and transfer?

            6    A.      If it's needed in a transaction then I'll do

            7    it.  If it's not and a seller is not really tied up

            8    about that then we'll keep it the way it is.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10    A.      But I would say 70 percent of the time I'm

           11    giving transfer and closing.

           12    Q.      All right.

           13                   Earlier you referred to this as a

           14    non-obligational offer, what did you mean by that?

           15    A.      Meaning that they're obligated to say no and

           16    they're obligated -- they're non-obligated to take my

           17    offer.  Like they don't have to take it.

           18    Q.      I see, okay.

           19    A.      And Angela tells them that as well on the

           20    phone before she sets the appointment.  If everything

           21    is in agreement and the property is a fit we're going

           22    to move forward with a non-obligational offer.  And

           23    then -- so she lets them be aware of that.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      73




            1                   And then on Paragraph 29 this is on the

            2    last page, the second to last paragraph.  Buyer

            3    reserves the right to show property prior to settlement

            4    for reasons including contractors, estimations and

            5    funding partners?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      Do you read this to the potential sellers as

            8    well?

            9    A.      Absolutely.

           10    Q.      And --

           11    A.      It's important.  It's one of the most

           12    important things in there.

           13    Q.      Right, why is it important?

           14    A.      For what it just says there.

           15    Q.      How do you describe -- other than what it says

           16    do you say anything more, do you describe that

           17    paragraph to the potential sellers?

           18    A.      I do, yeah.

           19    Q.      And what do you say to the potential sellers?

           20    A.      I say so the reason for this is we want to

           21    walk through with our contractors.  We want to get a

           22    game plan.  We're not touching anything but we want to

           23    get a game plan so when we settle on the property the

           24    next day we're ready to start rocking and rolling,

                                                                      74




            1    demo, you know, starting the construction aspect.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   In what percentage of times that you go

            4    out to meet a potential seller at their house are you

            5    successful at getting an Agreement of Sale?

            6    A.      I don't know.

            7    Q.      More than half?

            8    A.      No, I don't think it's more than half.

            9    Q.      Why might you not -- why have you not been

           10    successful at getting an Agreement of Sale?

           11    A.      Because we're not a fit, either their asking

           12    price is too much, they're not realistic, they have a

           13    nice house that's really not anything that I can do

           14    anything with or the contractor can do anything with,

           15    they can put it on the market and get market value.

           16    We're just not a fit in short.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18    A.      People that call us like they're calling us

           19    for a reason.  They're calling us because they can't

           20    put it on the market.  Their place is run down so

           21    that's why people call us.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23    A.      Or there's something situationally with that

           24    person's life that they need to have something that

                                                                      75




            1    moves quickly.

            2    Q.      I don't understand that situationally, what

            3    does that mean?

            4    A.      Yeah, they inherit a property, maybe they

            5    can't afford the taxes you know for the property so

            6    they don't have the time to put the money into it or to

            7    get a realtor, you know, 3 to 6 months to sell it.  So

            8    situationally that's what I'm talking about.

            9    Q.      I see.

           10                   In the time that you've been working

           11    with PPP has the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust ever

           12    acquired the property in its own name?

           13    A.      That I don't know of.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15    A.      I'm not actually at settlement so I don't know

           16    documents and paperwork.

           17    Q.      And to your knowledge are all of these

           18    contracts assigned to other buyers?

           19    A.      Not always, no.

           20    Q.      I want to focus on the ones that are not

           21    assigned to other people --

           22    A.      Uh-huh.

           23    Q.      -- if that's correct then the Philly Cash

           24    Buyer Land Trust may be the record owner in some

                                                                      76




            1    properties?

            2    A.      So okay -- so for instance like it can be

            3    something that I signed up, right.  I may buy it as a

            4    rental property.  So Capp Investments may become the

            5    owner or George may buy it but I don't know what his

            6    entity is to buy it.  I don't think Philly Cash Buyer

            7    Land Trust is taking possession of properties that I

            8    know of.

            9    Q.      Okay, I think I understand but let me just ask

           10    a few follow-up questions to ensure that I do.

           11                   From time to time does the Philly Cash

           12    Buyer Land Trust assign the Agreement of Sale to Capp

           13    Investments, LLC?

           14    A.      Yes.

           15    Q.      And from to time does the Philly Cash Buyer

           16    Land Trust assign these contracts to George Beatty

           17    affiliated LLC's?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   To your knowledge does Antwon Daniels

           21    have an LLC?

           22    A.      I don't know.

           23    Q.      To your knowledge has the Philly Cash Buyer

           24    Land Trust ever assigned the contracts to Antwon

                                                                      77




            1    Daniels or any LLC affiliated with Antwon Daniels?

            2    A.      I don't know that.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   How do you determine whether Capp

            5    Investments, LLC is going to be the assignee on an

            6    Agreement of Sale?

            7    A.      If the deal works, you know, and I'm able to

            8    be at a purchase price where other investors are.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10    A.      So there's -- one investor may be willing to

           11    pay $10,000 more than I'm willing to pay.  So obviously

           12    I'm not going to buy that deal because the investor is

           13    going to win out.  Same thing as a typical or

           14    conventional real estate transaction.

           15    Q.      Okay, I think I understand.

           16                   After you have obtained an Agreement of

           17    Sale with a potential seller how do you go about

           18    finding an investor for that property?

           19    A.      Tim handles that.

           20    Q.      And by Tim you mean Tim Stover?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Are you aware of an entity PA Off Market?

           23    A.      I am.

           24    Q.      And what does PA Off Market do?

                                                                      78




            1    A.      I believe that's the marketing funnel for the

            2    buyers.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   So what type of things does PA Off

            5    Market do to market a property?

            6    A.      They would --

            7                   MR. SCATENA:  Objection to form, you

            8    can answer.

            9                   MR. FROEHLICH:  No, no, no, I want to

           10    -- to the extent that I can address the objections I

           11    want to make sure I address them.

           12                   MR. SCATENA:  Just redefine things.

           13                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Sure.

           14    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           15    Q.      Earlier you said that you are aware of PA Off

           16    Market?

           17    A.      Uh-huh.

           18    Q.      To your knowledge what does PA Off Market

           19    specifically do?

           20    A.      They market the property to end buyers.

           21    Q.      And how does PA Off Market market the property

           22    to end buyers?

           23    A.      It will be listed on the multiple listing

           24    service, Facebook.

                                                                      79




            1    Q.      And to your knowledge does PA Off Market

            2    market the properties in any other way?

            3    A.      They're the two that I know of.  I mean, we

            4    have a list of buyers, I guess, we've done business

            5    with that an email gets sent out to them.

            6    Q.      Who sets the asking price for the properties

            7    that have an Agreement of Sale with the Philly Cash

            8    Buyer Land Trust?

            9    A.      Tim Stover.

           10    Q.      At what point -- I imagine at some point

           11    somebody runs a title search or title report for these

           12    properties?

           13    A.      It usually happens immediately, you know, once

           14    I input the contract into the system.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Why is a title report not done prior to

           17    entering an Agreement of Sale?

           18    A.      Because it costs money.

           19    Q.      And --

           20    A.      So -- I think I kind of know what you're

           21    getting at here so...

           22                   MR. SCATENA:  Let him ask his question.

           23    There isn't a question pending.

           24                   MR. FROEHLICH:  I'll ask the question.

                                                                      80




            1    We'll be formal about this.

            2    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            3    Q.      Has it ever occurred where after you

            4    reached -- after Tim pulls the title report that the

            5    incumbrances exceed the Agreement of Sale price?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      And has it ever occurred where the Philly Cash

            8    Buyer Land Trust cancels the Agreement of Sale and does

            9    not proceed to closing?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12    A.      Because it exceeds the sale price.

           13    Q.      In those cases how does the buyer -- I'm

           14    sorry.

           15                   In those cases how does the seller

           16    receive his or her cash deposit?

           17    A.      They would contact the title company and then

           18    the title company would send it out.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Does -- who pays that cash deposit to

           21    the title company?

           22    A.      I'm not sure exactly what entity that comes

           23    out of.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      81




            1                   But it's either PPP or the Philly Cash

            2    Buyer Land Trust or Construction Rehab, LLC; is that

            3    correct?

            4    A.      It would be something like that, yeah, I'm not

            5    sure which one, how that structure is set up for

            6    payments like that.  I don't know if it's like

            7    operating costs for Problem Property Pals or something.

            8    I don't know how that works.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   What percentage of agreements of sale

           11    would you estimate that are cancelled by the buyer?

           12    A.      Not many at all, 10 percent.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   Paragraph 23 of the Agreement of Sale

           15    discusses an extension option whereby the initial

           16    scheduled closing date may be postponed?

           17    A.      Uh-huh.

           18    Q.      Is the initial scheduled closing date ever

           19    postponed?

           20    A.      Yes, sometimes.

           21    Q.      Under what circumstances might an initial

           22    scheduled closing date be postponed?

           23    A.      Title remedies where we may be waiting for a

           24    tax payoff, a water lien payoff.  I don't know if you

                                                                      82




            1    ever dealt with the Water Department in the City of

            2    Philadelphia but sometimes it takes two and a half

            3    weeks to get a payoff for reasons of clearing title.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   How many agreements of sales has the

            6    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust entered into so far in

            7    2019?

            8    A.      I don't know that.

            9    Q.      Who would know that?

           10    A.      Probably George.

           11    Q.      Anybody else?

           12    A.      Maybe Tim.

           13    Q.      And --

           14    A.      I mean, I'm sure like if you go on PODIO you

           15    can figure that out in PODIO.  I've never done it

           16    though.  I never looked to see that.

           17    Q.      And just so I can understand why that is.  You

           18    know the number of agreement of sales that you

           19    personally have entered into but you don't know the

           20    number of agreement of sales that Antwon Daniels and

           21    other --

           22    A.      Well, I have -- I don't know exactly how many

           23    agreement of sales I've entered into.  But I don't know

           24    how many Antwon -- but it's all in the system.  You can

                                                                      83




            1    see it in the system if you went and looked for it.

            2    Q.      Got you.

            3    A.      Our system is very transparent.

            4    Q.      At some point after an Agreement of Sale is

            5    executed do you put a lockbox on the door?

            6    A.      I put a lockbox -- assuming the seller agrees

            7    right then and there.

            8    Q.      So are there sometimes when you do not put a

            9    lockbox on?

           10    A.      Yes, when the seller disagrees.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12    A.      But then they have to meet us at the property

           13    when we need to walk through it.  So if it's vacant

           14    like this property was it's easier for both parties.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Do you ever change the locks?

           17    A.      We don't.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19    A.      This was a rare occasion and can I explain

           20    this process here because you're asking questions and

           21    you're not getting the whole -- you're asking questions

           22    simply on that side of the story.

           23                   MR. SCATENA:  I get a chance to ask

           24    questions at the end so I'll clarify anything that

                                                                      84




            1    doesn't get --

            2                   THE WITNESS:  Okay, go ahead.

            3    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            4    Q.      Sure, so in a moment I'm going to be asking

            5    you questions specifically about Mr. Weary's case.

            6    A.      Go ahead.

            7    Q.      But why don't we --

            8    A.      Yes, we have in the past changed locks.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10    A.      For reasons of a lot of times there's a

           11    squatter in it that finally leaves we change the locks,

           12    things of that nature.  But this was a specific

           13    instance.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Why did you change the locks on

           16    Mr. Weary's house?

           17    A.      When we agreed to put a lockbox on the door at

           18    the time we signed up the agreement he was fine with

           19    it.  We put a lockbox on it.  When we went back to the

           20    property, I'm not sure if it was the next day or a

           21    couple days after the key was missing.  So rather than

           22    us -- his property being exposed to maybe somebody

           23    going into the property we changed the locks and put

           24    the new key back into the lockbox.

                                                                      85




            1    Q.      The key was missing from the lockbox?

            2    A.      Was missing from the lockbox.  Come to find

            3    out Mr. Weary took the key from the lockbox because he

            4    was backing out of the contract.

            5    Q.      I understand.  Okay, we're going to get back

            6    to Mr. Weary in a minute.

            7    A.      So that's why we changed the locks because we

            8    thought somebody had stolen the key out of the lockbox

            9    so we changed his locks not to have his property

           10    exposed.

           11    Q.      Got it.

           12    A.      But that's the first and only time I've ever

           13    done anything like that and it was because of that.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   The agreement to sell real estate

           16    requires the buyer to make a $500 cash deposit to

           17    Prosperity Abstract; is that correct?

           18    A.      Say that again?

           19    Q.      The agreement of sale in Mr. Weary's case

           20    requires a $500 cash deposit to be held in escrow by

           21    Prosperity Abstract?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      Did the buyer make a $500 cash deposit to

           24    Prosperity Abstract?

                                                                      86




            1    A.      I would imagine that happened but I don't --

            2    can't tell you yes, that actually happened at this day.

            3    But I would imagine so, yes.

            4    Q.      Why would you imagine so?

            5    A.      Because it's required.

            6    Q.      And who would make that cash deposit, which

            7    individual?

            8    A.      That I'm unsure.  It could be Kayla because

            9    she has access to banking accounts and stuff like that.

           10    It could be George.  I'm not a hundred percent.  It

           11    could be Tim, too.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   To your knowledge has the $500 -- if

           14    the $500 cash deposit was in fact placed in escrow to

           15    Prosperity Abstract to your knowledge has Prosperity

           16    Abstract refunded the $500?

           17    A.      I don't know that.

           18                   MR. BARSKY:  Off the record for a

           19    second.

           22    this time.)

                                                                      87




            1    Q.      To your knowledge did Tim Stover identify an

            2    investor or assignee for Mr. Weary's agreement?

            3    A.      I don't recall that.  I'm not sure.  Because I

            4    think it happened like really quickly like he tried to

            5    back out pretty quick.  So I don't know a hundred

            6    percent.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   How --

            9    A.      I know we had interest.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   How do you know that you had interest?

           12    A.      Because it was put into PODIO.  But I don't

           13    think we accepted anything because this happened.

           14    Q.      So in the PODIO record --

           15    A.      But I'm not certain about that.

           16    Q.      Well, let me ask a specific question.  If I

           17    were to look at the PODIO record for William Weary

           18    would I see an expression of interest?

           19    A.      You may, yes.  Like I said, I haven't looked

           20    at this file since back then.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22    A.      But I believe you have all the PODIO stuff or

           23    they have the PODIO stuff.

           24    Q.      You provided the PODIO stuff to your

                                                                      88




            1    attorneys?

            2    A.      I believe so.

            3    Q.      To your knowledge have you ever signed an

            4    Agreement of Sale on behalf of the Philly Cash Buyer

            5    Land Trust and then Tim was unable to identify an

            6    investor?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      What happens to those properties?

            9    A.      They get their deposit.  They get the deposit.

           10    Q.      Earlier I think you said that ten percent of

           11    the properties don't go to closing?

           12    A.      Yeah, some of that is title issues and some of

           13    that is us not being able to sell it or some unforeseen

           14    structural problem or something.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Do you ever obtain a Power of Attorney

           17    from a potential seller in connection with the

           18    Agreement of Sale -- and let me be very clear when I

           19    say a Power of Attorney, Power of Attorney granting the

           20    Power of Attorney to either you or PPP --

           21    A.      No.

           22    Q.      -- or the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust?

           23    A.      No.

           24    Q.      Have you ever attended a settlement for a

                                                                      89




            1    property where you have executed the Agreement of Sale?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Approximately how many?

            5    A.      I don't know, 5 or 10.

            6    Q.      And approximately how many times has Capp

            7    Investments, LLC been the assignee for an Agreement of

            8    Sale that you signed?

            9    A.      Twice.

           10    Q.      At the 5 or 10 settlements that you attended

           11    what individuals were at the table?

           12    A.      It's usually Kayla, somebody representing the

           13    title company, buyer, seller.

           14    Q.      And at the settlement -- are you familiar with

           15    the document that formerly was called the HUD-1?

           16    A.      Sure.

           17    Q.      And it has a new name on it but can we agree

           18    for purposes of this deposition we'll still call it the

           19    HUD-1?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   On the HUD-1 what is listed as the sale

           23    price of the property -- in other words, is the sale --

           24    on the HUD-1 is the sale price the price listed on the

                                                                      90




            1    Agreement of Sale or is the sale price --

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      -- the price that is paid by the assignee?

            4    A.      Yes, the sale price is the Agreement of Sale

            5    price on the HUD-1.

            6    Q.      How is the assignee fee represented on the

            7    HUD-1?

            8    A.      I believe it's construction consult, something

            9    like that.

           10    Q.      And who is the payee for the assignee?

           11    A.      The buyer.

           12    Q.      So the buyer would be the payor.

           13                   Who is listed as --

           14    A.      Construction Rehab.

           15    Q.      I see.

           16                   In your experience do the sellers learn

           17    of the final purchase price?

           18    A.      I don't know.  I mean, I'm not sure.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20    A.      It's never been an issue so I don't know.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   At the closings that you attended did

           23    the sellers know the final sale price?

           24    A.      I don't think so.

                                                                      91




            1    Q.      But they could figure it out if they wanted

            2    to, right?

            3    A.      Sure.

            4    Q.      And they can figure it out by looking at the

            5    HUD-1?

            6    A.      Sure.

            7    Q.      All right.

            8                   Let's talk about William Weary?

            9    A.      Okay.

           10    Q.      So do you recall -- how did you first become

           11    aware that William Weary had contacted PPP?

           12    A.      Like I said, an appointment gets set in to

           13    PODIO.  I have an appointment.  I go out and see

           14    Mr. Weary.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Do you remember on what date you went

           17    out to see him?

           18    A.      I don't remember exact dates.  I know it was

           19    cold because it was freezing.

           20    Q.      And the Agreement of Sale is dated November --

           21    you have signed it dated November 28th, 2018?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      Do you have any reason to believe that the

           24    date that you went out to the property was not November

                                                                      92




            1    28th, 2018?

            2    A.      No, no, it was definitely around that time.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Do you know how Mr. Weary became aware

            5    of the existence of PPP?

            6    A.      Probably got a letter I would imagine.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8    A.      I mean, I don't know if he's equipped for

            9    Facebook but probably got a marketing letter.

           10    Q.      All right.

           11                   Do you recall who entered his

           12    information in PODIO?

           13    A.      Probably Angela.

           14    Q.      What research did you do in advance of going

           15    to Mr. Weary's property?

           16    A.      Ran comparables in the area.

           17    Q.      Using Bright?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Do you remember how many days passed between

           20    Mr. Weary calling PPP and the scheduled appointment?

           21    A.      I don't but it couldn't have been more than a

           22    week.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   So when you arrived at Mr. Weary's

                                                                      93




            1    property he -- you had run the comparables already?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Do you remember what price range you were

            4    prepared to offer?

            5    A.      I believe I saw sale prices for houses that

            6    were "TLC" "fixer-upper" type in the description.  They

            7    ranged from $40,000 to $65,000.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Do you remember what time of day it was

           10    that you arrived at the property?

           11    A.      I think it was in the morning.  I think it was

           12    like -- and I'm guessing here.  I'm thinking it was

           13    10:00 maybe, 10:00 a.m.

           14    Q.      And when you arrived at the property was

           15    Mr. Weary already there?

           16    A.      Yes, I believe he was waiting in his car.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   I'm going to show you a map.

            1    map photo for 1810 West Ruscomb Street which is the

            2    property that's at issue in this litigation.  And do

            3    you see there's like that red Google thing that's

            4    there?

            5    A.      Yeah, uh-huh.

            6    Q.      And it looks like it's on the -- counting the

            7    corner property it looks like it's the 6th one from the

            8    corner?

            9    A.      Uh-huh.

           10    Q.      As you recall is this an accurate

           11    representation of 1810 West Ruscomb Street?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   Do you remember where you parked that

           15    morning?

           16    A.      Yes, I was down on the same side of the street

           17    probably down past that car a little bit.

           18    Q.      All right.

           19                   Well, let me give you a blue pen.  If

           20    you can write a one and circle it where you parked your

           21    car?

           22    A.      (Witness complies.)

           23    Q.      And do you remember where Mr. Weary parked his

           24    car?

                                                                      95




            1    A.      Yeah, I believe his car is right here, this

            2    dark one.  (Indicating.)

            3    Q.      Can you write a 2 and then circle that?

            4    A.      (Witness complies.)

            5    Q.      And just to be clear for the record, down

            6    below if you can write 1-dash, Anthony Cappello car and

            7    then 2, you know, William Weary car?

            8    A.      (Witness complies.)

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   So when you got to the property I

           11    imagine -- what kind of car did you bring that day?

           12    A.      Infiniti Q50.

           13    Q.      Four door sedan?

           14    A.      Yes.

           15    Q.      I imagine you get out of the car and you go up

           16    to the property and Mr. Weary meets you.  Do you meet

           17    outside the property or inside the property?

           18    A.      Well, we greeted each other outside of the

           19    property.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21    A.      Because I usually get there early so I was

           22    waiting for whenever the appointment was.

           23    Q.      Uh-huh, and then what happens next, does he

           24    let you into the house?

                                                                      96




            1    A.      Yeah, he lets us in.  We chatted for a bit

            2    about, you know, the same thing I said, kind of get a

            3    feel for why he's selling, you know, how long he's

            4    owned the property, you know, tenants, that kind of

            5    stuff and then he showed me around.

            6    Q.      Did he tell you that there were any tenants

            7    there?

            8    A.      There were no tenants there.  It was vacant.

            9    It was uninhabitable.

           10    Q.      Why was it uninhabitable?

           11    A.      It had no running water.  It had no heat and

           12    it was freezing in there.  Like that's how I remember

           13    it was so cold, my nose was running.  And the kitchen

           14    was like half there, half not.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16    A.      I mean, I would consider it unhabitable, maybe

           17    something else doesn't, but...

           18    Q.      Did you take pictures on that day?

           19    A.      I did.

            1    Q.      Mr. Cappello, this is Plaintiff's response

            2    to Defendant's request for production of documents.

            3    This is a document that your attorney sent me in

            4    response to a request for documents regarding this

            5    case.  And if you go about halfway through the document

            6    you'll see photos starting with -- yep, you're looking

            7    at it now.

            8    A.      Uh-huh.

            9    Q.      If you can flip through these photos, are

           10    these pictures that you took of the house?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Did you provide your attorneys all of

           14    the pictures that you took of the house?

           15    A.      I didn't provide anything to the attorneys.

           16    Q.      What happens after you take pictures of the

           17    house?

           18    A.      As far as what?

           19    Q.      Did you take them on your phone?

           20    A.      Yeah.

           21    Q.      And then after you leave the house do you

           22    upload the photos to PODIO?

           23    A.      Yeah, they get uploaded into PODIO.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      98




            1                   So do you -- it looks like there's

            2    about a dozen pictures here.  Does this appear to be

            3    all of the pictures that you took that day?

            4    A.      I don't know.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6    A.      Sometimes I take 12 pictures.  Sometimes I

            7    take 20, you know, depending on what we're taking

            8    pictures of.  I don't know if this is all of them.

            9    Q.      Okay, all right.

           10                   So did Mr. Weary give you a tour of his

           11    property?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      And did you take the pictures that we just

           14    reviewed?

           15    A.      I did.

           16    Q.      Okay, what happened next?

           17    A.      We started to discuss like kind of what he was

           18    looking for for the property.  And he had told me and I

           19    think he might have said somewhere like between $55,000

           20    and $60,000.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22    A.      And then we had a discussion about that, a

           23    negotiation about that.  And I told him I couldn't do

           24    that.

                                                                      99




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Did you tell him a price that you could

            3    do?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      And what price did you tell him that you could

            6    do?

            7    A.      Originally $35,000.

            8    Q.      And did he accept $35,000?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      And did he give you a counteroffer when you

           11    told him $35,000?

           12    A.      He did not give me a counteroffer.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   How did you -- so what happened after

           15    you offered $35,000?

           16    A.      After I offered $35,000 he said that was too

           17    low.  I said, well, where do we need to be to kind of

           18    have an agreement today.  And he started to think about

           19    it and then I started to explain the benefits, you

           20    know, I'll take care of the closing cost and transfer

           21    tax.  And then he was really not talking about price.

           22    He was basically saying, well, I got -- there's other

           23    people I may show the property to, you know, there are

           24    other appointments, I don't know if they were that day

                                                                     100




            1    or the next day or whatever.  And I was like, well, I'm

            2    here, you know, I would love to come meet somewhere in

            3    the middle.  And then we wound up settling on $40,000.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   Did you offer $40,000 or did he offer

            6    $40,000?

            7    A.      I offered $40,000.

            8    Q.      Were you still in the house at that point?

            9    A.      Yes.

           10    Q.      What happened after you --

           11    A.      We agreed on price and terms in the house.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13    A.      So I said, okay, let me go get the paperwork.

           14    Ran outside, went into my truck and got the paperwork.

           15    I said let's sit in your car because there's no heat in

           16    the house.  It's freezing.  I'm not standing outside,

           17    the wind was blowing.  So we sat in his car and that's

           18    when I went over the whole Agreement of Sale, explained

           19    everything about the lockbox, told him, you know, went

           20    over line for line, this is what this is, explained to

           21    him very clearly that once you and I sign this

           22    agreement we are in agreement to buy the property.  You

           23    can't sell it to anybody else.  He signed everything.

           24    I had no inclination that anything was off at that

                                                                     101




            1    point.  I thought we were in agreement.  He was cool.

            2    We put the lockbox on.  He didn't have any -- give me

            3    any blow back about the lockbox.  Because had he done

            4    that I would have said, fine, okay, Tim is just going

            5    to schedule a time that we can walk through and take a

            6    look.  But at that point like I asked him if he had any

            7    questions, was there any concerns, that kind of stuff

            8    and there was nothing.

            9    Q.      He had no questions?

           10    A.      He had no questions.

           11                   When this all went array was when I

           12    guess he went back to the house and saw the locks were

           13    changed, right.  And I explained to him well, this is

           14    why the key was missing.  He didn't tell me that he was

           15    the one that took the key at that point.

           16    Q.      At some point did he tell you --

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      -- that he was the one --

           19    A.      He made me feel like that I just changed the

           20    locks and was just doing something shady.  And I

           21    explained to him, I said, I don't know if it was my

           22    contractor that walked through or they lost the key, I

           23    don't know.  But because the key wasn't in there we

           24    replaced the locks so your house wasn't exposed.  And

                                                                     102




            1    that's when he proceeded and said, well, I took the key

            2    out because I changed my mind.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4    A.      And that's how that conversation went so...

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   That conversation was that held over

            7    the phone or in person?

            8    A.      That was over the phone.

            9    Q.      Do you remember the date of that conversation?

           10    A.      I don't.

           11    Q.      If I wanted to know the date of that

           12    conversation would it be reflected in PODIO?

           13    A.      It would not because it wasn't linked through

           14    PODIO.  I had his number I dialled on my phone.

           15    Q.      In the deal notes do you track the phone calls

           16    that you have with the potential seller after --

           17    A.      Yes, yes.

           18    Q.      So --

           19    A.      So I probably if I went and updated PODIO I

           20    probably put something like hey, seller this is what

           21    happened, you know, explained what happened, you know,

           22    he's trying to back out, blah, blah, blah, you know.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24    A.      I would have updated PODIO or somewhere in the

                                                                     103




            1    comments.

            2    Q.      Right, so this lawsuit was filed on December

            3    6th.  So we can surmise that this conversation happened

            4    --

            5    A.      Between then.  It was pretty quick.  It wasn't

            6    long between from when I signed it up to when he wanted

            7    to back out.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   So I think there's only about 8 days

           10    between this agreement and the lawsuit being filed?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Did George Beatty ever speak to William Weary

           13    to your knowledge?

           14    A.      No.

           15    Q.      And did Tim Stover ever talk to William Weary?

           16    A.      He may have.  I'm not sure but he may have.

           17    Q.      After November 28th to your knowledge did

           18    anybody else associated with PPP or Construction rehab,

           19    LLC or the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust ever speak to

           20    Mr. Weary?

           21    A.      Yes, he had called in a couple of times after

           22    that whether it was Angela that picked up the phone or

           23    it was Kayla.  Because after the deal was signed up

           24    Kayla is like the point of contact from that point on.

                                                                     104




            1    So it could have been Kayla or Angela when he had

            2    called in.

            3    Q.      Got you.

            4                   And to your knowledge does Kayla enter

            5    the record of phone calls that she has with potential

            6    sellers in PODIO?

            7    A.      She should, yes.  At least what transpired on

            8    the call.

            9    Q.      Right, a moment ago you said that your

           10    contractors walked through the house?

           11    A.      Yes, meaning Tim walked my contractors

           12    through.  I wasn't sure at that point how the key got

           13    out of the lockbox.  So I told him I was unsure how

           14    that happened and this is why we did what we did and

           15    that's how it went down.  That's exactly what I said to

           16    him.  Because I wasn't sure at that point if somebody

           17    had stolen the lockbox or what.  He just said you

           18    changed my locks and I'm like well, the key was missing

           19    and I didn't know who did it.

           20    Q.      To your knowledge did any contractors go into

           21    the house at your direction?

           22    A.      I think Tim might have sent somebody over,

           23    yes.

           24    Q.      Why do you think that Tim might have sent

                                                                     105




            1    somebody over?

            2    A.      Because he is the one that handles the

            3    disposition part of the transaction.

            4    Q.      But did Tim tell you that he sent contractors

            5    there?

            6    A.      Yeah, there was people that went over.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8    A.      So I didn't know if they lost the key or if

            9    somebody stole it.

           10    Q.      Okay?

           11    A.      So that's why I changed the locks.

           12    Q.      Okay, I want to be clear, so did people go

           13    into the house after November 28th when this agreement

           14    was --

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17    A.      That was understood though that that was going

           18    to happen.

           19    Q.      Sure, okay.

           20                   At some point did you tell Mr. Weary

           21    that Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust was considering

           22    bringing a lawsuit against him?

           23    A.      Say that again?

           24    Q.      Sure, when did Mr. Weary first learn that the

                                                                     106




            1    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust was considering bringing a

            2    lawsuit against him?

            3                   MR. SCATENA:  Objection as to form but

            4    you may answer.

            5                   MR. FROEHLICH:  No, no, no.  If you

            6    have an objection as to form I'll do my best to --

            7                   MR. SCATENA:  Yeah, he wouldn't know

            8    when Mr. Weary first learned of something.

            9    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           10    Q.      Did you ever tell Mr. Weary that the Philly

           11    Cash Buyer Land Trust was considering filing a lawsuit

           12    against him?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      When did you first tell Mr. Weary about that?

           15    A.      It was sometime in that 8 day period.  I don't

           16    know exactly when.

           17    Q.      All right.

           18    A.      It was when he informed me that he was no

           19    longer selling the property and he wanted to back out.

           20    It was at that point I said, well, you know, that's not

           21    how the contract works and I explained to him how a

           22    contract works.  And he had said, well, I can change my

           23    mind.  And I'm like well, that's kind of not how it

           24    works.  I've already allocated time and resources and

                                                                     107




            1    money to this process so...

            2                       - - -

            3                   (Whereupon, a brief discussion was held

            4    off the record.)

            5                       - - -

            6                   (Whereupon, a brief break was taken at

            7    this time.)

            8                       - - -

            9    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           10    Q.      Mr. Cappello, you said Tim and my contractors.

           11    What are the names of the contractors that went into

           12    the property?

           13    A.      I don't know who he took through the property.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15    A.      I'm not sure who he took through.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   After you spoke to Mr. Weary about

           18    potentially filing a lawsuit what did you do next?

           19    A.      Well, I mean, first I tried to see if there

           20    was a way we can rectify it.  Like I didn't want --

           21    that was like the last option like what do we need to

           22    kind of make this go through.  And he was just not

           23    willing to talk about it at all.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     108




            1    A.      So I said that and then your question was --

            2    Q.      And then what did you do, did you talk to

            3    George Beatty?

            4    A.      Yeah, yeah, I talked to Tim, George, said this

            5    is what's going on kind of thing.  That's when I guess

            6    it was decided to file the lis pendens.

            7    Q.      And when you say file the lis pendens what

            8    does that mean or what's your understanding of what it

            9    means?

           10    A.      It's some kind of judgment or something

           11    against the property that's being contested -- the

           12    property is being contested.

           13    Q.      And what is the -- like what's the effect of

           14    the lis pendens?

           15    A.      The effect is I would imagine is get the

           16    seller to acknowledge that he's in contract.

           17    Q.      I know you're not a lawyer and I'm not asking

           18    for a legal opinion.  But what is your understanding

           19    about how a lis pendens works; why would it --

           20    A.      My understanding would be it's like a lien I

           21    guess that's filed against the property of some sort.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Do you remember on what day you spoke

           24    to George and Tim about this situation?

                                                                     109




            1    A.      I don't remember the exact day.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   I'm going to show you screen shots of

            4    your public Facebook page.

            5                       - - -

            6                   (Whereupon, D-5 was marked for

            7    identification.)

            8                       - - -

            9    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           10    Q.      Just laying some foundation here, do you have

           11    a Facebook page?

           12    A.      I do.

           13    Q.      Looking at -- looking at the upper left-hand

           14    corner --

           15    A.      This is true.  This is true.  (Indicating.)

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   So this is a screen shot of a post that

           18    you made on December 4th.  It says, well, I have 30

           19    days to change my mind.  Ah, no, you don't.

           20    Mr. Seller, that's not how the contract works.

           21                   Is this your posting?

           22    A.      That is.

           23    Q.      And the Mr. Seller is that William Weary?

           24    A.      I'm not a hundred percent, it could be.  This

                                                                     110




            1    happened around the same time, could be.

            2    Q.      And if you look down at the comment down below

            3    you say sure you can as long as you don't mind a lis

            4    pendens filed against the property --

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      -- is that your comment as well?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Since this is dated December 4th do you have

            9    any reason to believe that the conversation that you

           10    just described with George Beatty and Tim Stover

           11    also -- sorry, that question was confusing.  Let me

           12    restate it.

           13    A.      I would imagine that this is probably the day

           14    that Mr. Weary probably wanted to cancel the agreement.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16    A.      That's what I would assume.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   Do you recall Mr. Weary ever telling

           19    you that he had trouble reading?

           20    A.      Never.

           21    Q.      Earlier you said that after you left your

           22    conversation with Mr. Weary you had no inclination that

           23    he had a problem with it?

           24    A.      Uh-huh.

                                                                     111




            1    Q.      Have you had situations where you left

            2    thinking that there might be trouble?

            3    A.      No, I try to alleviate all their concerns

            4    there.  If there's a concern let me know because we'll

            5    address it now and I'll try to alleviate that for you.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7    A.      That's kind of like how we close.  I don't

            8    want to -- I want them to feel comfortable about doing

            9    business.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11    A.      I'm not stealing little old lady houses.

           12    Q.      Okay, all right.

           13                   Have agreements of sale that you signed

           14    on behalf of the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust ever

           15    resulted in litigation prior to Mr. Weary's case?

           16    A.      No -- litigation, no.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18    A.      Not that I know of.

                                                                     112




            1    a lawsuit that was brought by the Philly Cash Buyer

            2    Land Trust against Joan Watts, Trustee; The Meldon

            3    McLaine Revocable Living Trust in Delaware County in

            4    September of last year.  If you can flip towards the

            5    back under Exhibit A you'll see standard agreement to

            6    sell real estate.

            7                   Is that your signature on Page 5?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      And I should say just for the record you'll

           10    see on that page it says -- has a water mark copying.

           11    That was not on the original.  That's a function of the

           12    Court system.

           13                   Do you remember meeting with this

           14    potential seller regarding the sale of this property?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      So this is a lawsuit that Philly Cash Buyer

           17    Land Trust brought.  Were you aware that the Philly

           18    Cash Buyer Land Trust brought this lawsuit?

           19    A.      Yes, you did say litigation though.

           20    Technically, this is not -- we're not in litigation.

           21    We weren't in litigation for this.  We filed a lis

           22    pendens.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   When I say litigation what does that --

                                                                     113




            1    A.      I misunderstood.  I'm thinking like courtroom,

            2    we're under the process of being -- yeah.

            3    Q.      So when I said --

            4    A.      So yes, if that question was am I aware of any

            5    other lis pendens that were filed, yes.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   What do you remember about this

            8    transaction?

            9                   MR. SCATENA:  I'm just going to object

           10    to every single one you're going to introduce moving

           11    forward just about relevance and object to form, all of

           12    the above.  This is a separate matter, separate

           13    property, different defendant, yeah, you can answer,

           14    but...

           15                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Well, you said

           16    relevance which --

           17                   MR. SCATENA:  It's object to form.

           18                   MR. FROEHLICH:  You said form.  I want

           19    to make sure that I address any issues that you have

           20    about form.

           21                   MR. SCATENA:  Okay, sorry, object to

           22    the document, not form.

           23                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Okay.

           24                   MR. SCATENA:  To the document and

                                                                     114




            1    relevance in this deposition.

            2                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Okay, relevance your

            3    objection is heard.  Do you have an objection to the

            4    form of the question?

            5                   MR. SCATENA:  No, sorry.  I'll

            6    withdrawal the objection as to form.

            7                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Okay.

            8    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            9    Q.      So Mr. Cappello, what do you remember about

           10    this transaction of this property, it looks like 26

           11    Bailey Road in Yeadon?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      Did you meet with the potential seller in this

           14    case?

           15    A.      I did.

           16    Q.      Did this case ever go to closing?

           17    A.      No, because she was up for tax sale.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   Why --

           20    A.      I got contacted by an attorney from her

           21    saying, you know, that it's up for tax sale.  They

           22    tried to fight the tax sale.  She wound up losing the

           23    house anyway.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     115




            1    A.      Because she backed out of the house.  Had she

            2    had sold the property she would have gotten money.  But

            3    her lawyer advised her not to and let it go to upset

            4    sale.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6    A.      Because there was inheritance tax and stuff

            7    like that associated with the whole file.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   This may sound like a basic question

           10    but I do want to ask it.  Did Philly Cash Buyer Land

           11    Trust bring this case to enforce the contract that Joan

           12    Watts executed?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   When you left your meeting with Joan

           16    Watts did you have any inclination that there would be

           17    an issue with this Agreement of Sale?

           18    A.      She was a hundred percent in agreement.  She

           19    was afraid of losing the house and not getting

           20    anything.  It wasn't until she had contacted her

           21    attorney who opened up the trust that he explained to

           22    her, well, if you're paying inheritance tax you're only

           23    going to walk about away with $7,000 or whatever the

           24    number was.  He's like you might as well just let it go

                                                                     116




            1    to upset sale.  And that's the last -- I think it went

            2    to tax sale.  I don't know if it was ever purchased but

            3    it went to tax sale.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            9    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

           10    Q.      And if you can take a look at this and for

           11    identification purposes I can represent that D-7 is a

           12    copy of a Complaint captioned the Philly Cash Buyer

           13    Land Trust versus Theresa Depiera that was filed in

           14    Philadelphia County Court in July of 2018.  If you can

           15    flip to the back under Exhibit A did you sign this

           16    agreement to sell real estate?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Do you remember meeting with Theresa Depiera?

           19    A.      Yep.

           20    Q.      Did this transaction go to closing?

           21    A.      It did.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Why did the Philly Cash Buyer Land

           24    Trust bring a lawsuit against Ms. Theresa Depiera?

            1                   MR. SCATENA:  I'm going to object as to

            2    form.  He can't speak as to why Philly Cash Buyer did

            3    something.

            4                   MR. FROEHLICH:  Fair enough.

            5    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            6    Q.      Do you remember -- what, if anything, do you

            7    remember about this case?

            8    A.      I remember I signed it up and they tried to

            9    back out of the agreement.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Why did they try to back out of the

           12    agreement?

           13    A.      They claimed they weren't selling anymore.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Do you remember if they gave you a

           16    reason for not selling?

           17    A.      They didn't give me a reason.  They just said

           18    they changed their mind.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   And after the Philly Cash Buyer Land

           21    Trust brought this case did they comply with the

           22    Agreement of Sale?

           23    A.      Eventually, yes.

           24    Q.      Okay.

            6    Q.      So what's been marked as D-8 I can tell you

            7    for identification purposes is a lawsuit brought by the

            8    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust against Kelly Ward,

            9    representative of the Estate of Tammy Glass in the

           10    Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia in January of

           11    2018.

           12                   Mr. Cappello, if you can flip to the

           13    back under Exhibit A you can see the standard agreement

           14    to sell real estate.

           15                   MR. SCATENA:  Just a quick objection,

           16    Counsel.  I don't have the actual -- mine just goes

           17    right to the exhibit.  Do you have the actual --

            1    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            2    Q.      So for identifications purposes we're looking

            3    at D-9 which is a lawsuit brought by the Philly Cash

            4    Buyer Land Trust against Susan Clifford in Delaware

            5    County, Pennsylvania and the verification was signed on

            6    November 8th, 2018.  And if you can flip to Exhibit A

            7    of this one you'll see the same standard agreement to

            8    sell real estate.

            9                   Did you sign this agreement?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      All right.

           12                   Do you recall meeting with Susan

           13    Clifford to sell this property?

           14    A.      I do.

           15    Q.      And did this agreement go to closing?

           16    A.      It did not.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   What do you remember about why it did

           19    not go to closing?

           20    A.      I don't -- well, she tried to back out.  She

           21    was -- the house was vacant.  Her husband had gotten

           22    arrested or something like that.  She was losing the

           23    house to tax sale so she wanted to sell.  We signed an

           24    agreement.  She agreed.  Everything was okay.  And then

                                                                     120




            1    a couple of days later she said her husband wasn't in

            2    agreement or something like that.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   This did not -- did you say this did

            5    not go to closing?

            6    A.      It didn't.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   Do you recall why it did not go to

            9    closing?

           10    A.      I don't.  I just explained she tried to back

           11    out.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Philly Cash Buyer --

           14    A.      I don't know if it went to tax sale or -- she

           15    was up for tax sale.  I don't know if it went to tax

           16    sale or not.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   And am I correct in thinking that the

           19    Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust brought this litigation in

           20    order to have Susan Clifford comply with the terms of

           21    the Agreement of Sale?

           22    A.      Yes.

            4    Q.      If you can go to the back page of D-8 and for

            5    identification purposes D-8, Philly Cash Buyer Land

            6    Trust v. Kelly Ward, Representative of the Estate of

            7    Tammy Glass.

            8                   Is that your signature?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Do you recognize whose signature that

           12    is?

           13    A.      I don't.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Do you recall this transaction?

           16    A.      I don't, no.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   And if you look at Page 3 of the

           19    agreement there's an initial JC.  KW I imagine is Kelly

           20    Ward.  But there's an initial JC.  To your knowledge

           21    has anyone with those initials worked as an acquisition

           22    manager with the initials of JC?

           23    A.      JC, we had a JD but not a JC.

           24    Q.      Okay, all right.

            5    BY MR. FROEHLICH:

            6    Q.      So what's in front of you has been marked as

            7    D-10 I can represent for identification purposes that

            8    this is a copy of a Complaint brought by the Philly

            9    Cash Buyer Land Trust against Timothy L. Jones in

           10    Philadelphia County Court on November 20th, 2017.

           11    Mr. Cappello, if you can skip to the back where it is

           12    Exhibit A and you can see the standard agreement to

           13    sell real estate.

           14                   Is that your signature on the last page

           15    of the agreement?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      And do you remember this transaction with

           18    Timothy Jones of 3542 West Carlisle Street?

           19    A.      Yes.

           20    Q.      Did this property go to closing?

           21    A.      No, it had title problems.

           22    Q.      Did Timothy Jones attempt to back out of this

           23    agreement?

           24    A.      I don't know that he tried to back out.  I

                                                                     123




            1    think he went MIA.  He went missing in action.  He just

            2    stopped answering our calls.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4    A.      And then I finally got him on the phone and we

            5    were moving forward.  It just turned out that he was

            6    like very irresponsible and just didn't call us back.

            7    Then it wound up having an IRS lien or something on it

            8    that we couldn't settle on.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   Am I correct in saying that the reason

           11    that the Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust brought this

           12    action against Timothy Jones is an attempt to have

           13    Mr. Jones comply with the standard agreement to sell

           14    real estate that he signed?

           15    A.      Yes.

            1    client of ours here at Community Legal Services as

            2    well.

            3                   If you can look at the last page of

            4    this.

            5                   Is that your signature?

            6    A.      No.

            7    Q.      Whose signature is that?

            8    A.      I don't know.

            9    Q.      If you look at Page 3 of the agreement?

           10    A.      I would be I would assume that it's John Delp.

           11    Q.      Jonathan Delp, okay.

           12                   Before we mark this next one -- let me

           13    see if you can recognize this.  What I'm showing you is

           14    a copy of lawsuit filed by Philly Cash Buyer Land Trust

           15    against the Estate of Pearl Carter, Brenda Carter,

           16    Executrix.  And for some reason it is missing the last

           17    page.  So I can't tell -- it looks like the initials

           18    are --

           19    A.      Yeah, these people tried to sell this property

           20    to three different people.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   Were you involved in this case?

           23    A.      No.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     125




            1                   Do you know who at Philly Cash Buyer

            2    Land Trust --

            3    A.      I'm not sure.  But I do remember because it

            4    was like a running joke that there was multiple people

            5    trying to buy the property.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Do you recognize --

            8    A.      They were trying to get cash deposits up front

            9    like in their hand.  They were just trying to steal

           10    money these people.

           11    Q.      Do you recognize these initials?

           12    A.      It could be JC, I don't know.

           13                   MR. FROEHLICH:  I believe we're almost

           14    completed.  If you can just give me two minutes and let

           15    me talk with Thu and we should be able to wrap this up.

           22    BY MR. SCATENA:

           23    Q.      All right, for the record, CJ Scatena.  I'm

           24    just going to ask just a few follow-up questions.

                                                                     127




            1                   The day you went and met William Weary

            2    at the property do you recall his state of mind?

            3    A.      Yeah, it was fine.  I didn't see anything that

            4    was off or anything.

            5    Q.      Did he seem intoxicated or anything like that?

            6    A.      No.

            7    Q.      Did he seem like he was mentally -- in your

            8    opinion, you're dealing with a lot of people, able to

            9    comprehend what you're saying?

           10    A.      Yeah, he was asking questions, you know,

           11    interacting with me.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   And after you -- said you went into his

           14    car and you went over the details and he signed the

           15    agreement in the car?

           16    A.      He signed the agreement in the car, yes.

           17    Q.      Did he ask you any questions about what was

           18    going to happen after or anything to do with --

           19    A.      I explained it to him.  This is what's going

           20    to happen.  We're going to put it on lockbox.  My

           21    partner or we would be walking through with our

           22    partners.  And he seemed totally okay with that.  He

           23    didn't put up any argument or any apprehension about

           24    it.

                                                                     128




            1    Q.      Did he see you physically put the lockbox on

            2    the door?

            3    A.      Oh, yeah, I showed him how to work it just in

            4    case he needed to get in it.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   And he never had any issues after you

            7    put that lockbox on the door until obviously the phone

            8    call?

            9    A.      He obviously figured out how to work it

           10    because he went in and took the key out.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   Do you know if this was Mr. Weary's

           13    primary residence?

           14    A.      It was my belief that it wasn't.  He had told

           15    me that it was a rental property that he owned for some

           16    time.

           17    Q.      So it was an investment property?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      So he was renting it out prior to -- he was

           20    renting it out before but then when you went to the

           21    property it was vacant and no one was living there.

           22    A.      Yes, he explained to me it was recently

           23    vacant.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     129




            1                   And can you again describe the

            2    condition of the property when you went into it?

            3    A.      It was in rough shape.  There was no running

            4    water.  There was no electric.  I had to use a

            5    flashlight walking around.  The kitchen floor was --

            6    the sub floor was sinking.  It seemed uninhabitable to

            7    me.  The back door -- basement door was off the hinges.

            8    I had to slam it and squeeze it shut again so nobody

            9    can get in.

           10    Q.      So it looks like in your opinion that nobody

           11    had been living there?

           12    A.      No, yeah.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   And you said when he called you I

           15    believe it was sometime around I guess we established

           16    around December 4th or 5th in 2018.  When he indicated

           17    that he no longer wanted to sell the property did he

           18    tell you why?

           19    A.      He just said he changed his mind.  And he said

           20    I have 30 days to change my mind.  Somebody had told

           21    him that he had 30 days to change his mind and I'm like

           22    that's not how it works.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   MR. SCATENA:  That's it, no further

            1    questions.

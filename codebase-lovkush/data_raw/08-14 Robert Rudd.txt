           2                            -  -  -

           3                  (It was stipulated by and among counsel

           4   that sealing, certification, and filing be waived; and

           5   that all objections, except as to the form of the

           6   question, be reserved until the time of trial.)

           8                  ROBERT RUDD, having been duly sworn, was

           9   examined and testified as follows:

          10                            -  -  -

          11                          EXAMINATION

          12                            -  -  -

          13                  MR. CRANE:  Mr. Rudd, you have a right to

          14   read the document.  There's going to be a transcript made

          15   today, and you have a right to read -- to read it before

          16   it's, I guess, finalized, right?  Or you can just waive

          17   that right, and it -- the transcript will be made.  It

          18   will be a transcript like this.  This is actually the

          19   transcript of Mr. Bassett's deposition.

          20                  Most people just waive the reading and

          21   signing of the transcript, but you're entitled to read it

          22   and sign it before it gets distributed.  What do you want

          23   to do?  Do you care?

          24                  THE WITNESS:  I could look over it briefly.

          25                  MR. CRANE:  Okay.  I think that he's --
                                                                      5



           1   he's not waiving reading or signing.

           2   BY MR. CRANE:

           3   Q.     Mr. Rudd, you're a sworn witness.

           4   A.     Yes, I am.

           9   19143.

          10                  MR. CRANE:  And that address is also on

          11   Exhibit -- that's indicated right on Rudd-1.  You can see

          12   it's in the second line there, okay?

          13   BY MR. CRANE:

          15   A.     2/16/53.

          24   A.     No, I do not.

          25   Q.     Tell us about your education.  How far did you go
                                                                      6

          11   Q.     Where?

          12   A.     Reading University -- I mean Reading Community

          14   Q.     Yes.

          16   Q.     Have you obtained any degrees?

          17   A.     I have associate's --

          18   Q.     Yes.

          19   A.     -- in psychology, anthropology, and sociology.

          20   Q.     Where did you get that associate's from?

          21   A.     Well, actually, I gained most of the credits at

          22   Reading Community College --

          23   Q.     Understood.

          24   A.     -- and then transferred to Temple.

          25   Q.     Yes.  All right.  Are you employed, sir?
                                                                      7



           1   A.     Not at this time.

           2   Q.     Are you retired?

           3   A.     I'm retired, yes.

           4   Q.     And when did you retire?

           5   A.     I -- I got injured.  I had a stroke in --

           6   Q.     A stroke.

           7   A.     -- just about ten years ago.

           8   Q.     So you mean in 2009?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Who were -- and is that when you last worked, in

          11   2009?  2009, is that when you last worked?

          12   A.     No.  I did food service just after that, but I -- I

          13   couldn't hack it.

          14   Q.     Who -- who was -- who was your employer that you

          15   retired from?

          16   A.     Actually, at the time of retirement, I was working

          17   for a caterer.

          18   Q.     A caterer?

          19   A.     Yeah.  Well, actually Betty the Caterer in

          20   Philadelphia is one of the --

          21   Q.     What -- what was it called?

          22   A.     Betty the Caterer.

          23   Q.     Betty the Caterer?

          24   A.     Uh-huh.  That's mostly where I'm known in

          25   Philadelphia.
                                                                      8



           1   Q.     All right.  How long did you work for Betty the

           2   Caterer?

           3   A.     Twenty years.

           4   Q.     About 20 years, okay.  Where was that -- where is

           5   that located generally?  We don't need the address.  You

           6   know, where in Philadelphia?

           7   A.     Philadelphia.

           8   Q.     What section?

           9   A.     Mount Airy section.

          10   Q.     Mount -- is it still in existence?

          11   A.     Yes, it is.

          12   Q.     Is it still called Betty the Caterer?

          13   A.     Yeah.  I think they moved the location though.

          14   Q.     Well, that's fine.  We could -- this is just some

          15   background information to give -- to give us an idea of --

          16   of yourself.  The purpose of this deposition, Mr. Rudd, is

          17   to ask you about the statement that you provided.

          18                  You may end up being a witness in this

          19   case, essentially what we call "damages witnesses," a

          20   witness to give a before-and-after picture to the jury

          21   relative to your knowledge of Mr. Bassett, the injuries he

          22   sustained in the 2/27/18 automobile accident, if you have

          23   any information regarding that, if you have any

          24   information regarding the accident, and any information or

          25   knowledge you have regarding how the accident has affected
                                                                      9



           1   Mr. Bassett's life.  And much of that, you've revealed in

           2   this five-page statement --

           3   A.     That's correct.

           4   Q.     -- that we -- we marked as Rudd-1.  It's gonna be

           5   attached to this transcript as an exhibit, okay?

           6                  And so this is just an investigative tool

           7   for the defendants to learn or inquire about those areas

           8   that I just told you about.

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     This is not a cross-examination or a -- this is not

          11   an interrogation, okay?

          12   A.     Uh-huh.

          13   Q.     So if -- if you don't understand a question that we

          14   pose to you -- myself and Mr. O'Donnell or Mr. Sheridan,

          15   they may pose questions to you.  If you don't understand a

          16   question, say so, and we'll rephrase it, okay?

          17   A.     Okay.

          18   Q.     And if you don't know the answer to a question, the

          19   answer "I don't know" is a perfectly acceptable answer,

          20   all right?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Try to wait until the question is posed before you

          23   answer, and the attorneys will wait until you give your

          24   answer before we ask our next question.  That -- the

          25   purpose is to facilitate the court reporter.  One person
                                                                     10



           1   speaking at a time, easier for the court reporter to take

           2   an accurate -- take the transcript accurately, okay?

           3   A.     I understand.

           4   Q.     And the -- and the same instruction relative to

           5   answer verbally, which you have been doing.  Some people,

           6   you know, they shrug and they -- you know, they grunt.

           7   But you've been answering verbally, with -- with words,

           8   which is good.  That's what we need.  Once again, it

           9   facilitates the court reporter, okay?

          10   A.     I understand.

          11   Q.     Have you ever given a deposition before, Mr. Rudd?

          12   A.     Yeah, I think I have.

          13   Q.     What are the details in that regard, do you know?

          14   Was that a civil case?  What was the matter about

          15   generally?

          16   A.     It would -- it would probably be civil, yes.

          17   Q.     Well, when you say "probably," this is what I'm

          18   telling you:  If you don't remember or if you don't know,

          19   the answer "I don't know" is perfectly acceptable.  When

          20   you use a word like "probably" --

          21   A.     Well, definitely.  Let me -- let me say

          22   "definitely."

          23   Q.     Just a, you know, final instruction here.  When you

          24   use the word "probably," that leads us to believe you're

          25   drawing a conclusion, which sometimes we might want; but
                                                                     11



           1   mostly, we just want to have some facts from you.  And if

           2   you don't know a fact, then you can just say you don't

           3   know.

           4   A.     Right.

           5   Q.     But you did give a prior deposition?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     And what was the nature of that?  Was that a case?

           8   Was that a -- was that a lawsuit?

           9   A.     Civil case.

          10   Q.     And what kind of civil case was it?

          11   A.     Probably involved in an accident.

          12   Q.     An automobile accident?

          13   A.     Yeah.

          14   Q.     Were you involved in that accident?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     Were you -- were you the injured person?  Were you

          17   suing?

          18   A.     Yeah.  Yes.

          19   Q.     What was your injury?

          20   A.     Well, at that time, I -- I think I injured my head.

          21   Q.     Injured your head.  Did you receive any treatment,

          22   medical treatment?

          23   A.     Yeah.

          24   Q.     Do you know what year this was?  What year was the

          25   deposition?
                                                                     12



           1   A.     Well, you're saying -- what I'm thinking about is

           2   the interrogatory.  Are they the same?

           3   Q.     No, they're not.  But that's a legitimate -- that's

           4   a legitimate inquiry.  Let me ask you this question:

           5   Relative to this auto accident that you were involved in,

           6   do -- do you know the date or the year when -- when it

           7   occurred?

           8   A.     The accident?

           9   Q.     Yeah.

          10   A.     I don't particularly know the date.

          11   Q.     What year was it?

          12   A.     It was -- I think it's -- where are we at, 2019?

          13   Q.     Yeah.

          14   A.     I would say it was in 2017.

          15   Q.     Where did that accident occur, in -- in

          16   Philadelphia?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Where?

          19   A.     It had to be where Marvin lived in -- in the

          20   Poconos area.

          21   Q.     All right.  Do you know that to be true, that --

          22   that the accident happened in the Poconos?

          23   A.     I don't know that particularly, but I know he lives

          24   out there.

          25   Q.     Understood.  But all -- all we're trying to find
                                                                     13



           1   out is if you know where this -- where this 2017 auto

           2   accident occurred.

           3   A.     No, I don't.

           4   Q.     Was it in Pennsylvania?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     And you say it was somewhere in the vicinity of

           7   where Mr. Bassett lived?

           8   A.     That's correct.

           9   Q.     Was Mr. Bassett in the car with you when -- when

          10   this accident occurred?

          11   A.     Not with me, no.

          12   Q.     Were you alone in the car when the accident

          13   occurred?

          14   A.     What -- what are you referring to?

          15   Q.     Were talking about the car accident of 2017, the

          16   accident that involved you.

          17   A.     No, I wasn't in the car.  And I -- I wasn't in the

          18   car.  I'm a witness as a friend of his.

          19   Q.     Oh.  I see.  That -- that's for today.

          20   A.     That's --

          21   Q.     I -- I asked you if -- if you ever been in a motor

          22   vehicle accident.

          23   A.     You asked me, and I was misconstrued by were you

          24   talking about me or were you talking about this present

          25   accident.
                                                                     14



           1   Q.     Understood.  That's reasonable.  Let me just clear

           2   this up.  I -- this area of questioning has to do with

           3   whether you -- you had ever given a deposition before,

           4   ever, prior to today.

           5   A.     Sure.

           6   Q.     And you -- you told us that you did give a

           7   deposition, and it had something to do with an auto

           8   accident in which you were involved in --

           9   A.     That's correct.

          10   Q.     -- in 2017.

          11   A.     No.  I was -- I was mistaken there.

          12   Q.     That's all right.  When was it?

          13   A.     I'm jogging through my memory now.  Been a while

          14   since.

          15   Q.     Sure.

          16   A.     Let's see.  This year is 2019.  I'm trying to make

          17   a correlation in my mind.

          18   Q.     Take your time.

          19   A.     It's hard to say.  My memory is lost.

          20   Q.     Your memory is lost?

          21   A.     Yeah.  I had a stoke in 2 --

          22   Q.     You said 2009?

          23   A.     Yeah, I had a stroke.  So dates and things like

          24   that get past me as far as if they're not fresh in my

          25   memory.  I -- I don't want to quote something that would
                                                                     15



           1   give the wrong impression of dates, you know, that I'm not

           2   cognizant of it.

           3   Q.     That's reasonable.  What -- what the attorneys

           4   would want you to do, though, if you could, in response to

           5   a question that we pose to you:  If you can give a

           6   reasonable estimate, well, then we would want to hear

           7   that.  But if you were just gonna guess in response to a

           8   question, we would rather -- that's not really helpful,

           9   okay?

          10   A.     And that's what I'm trying not to do.

          11   Q.     Understood.  You -- you can certainly do that.  But

          12   is it accurate to say that you were involved in an

          13   accident, but you just don't know the date?  And you --

          14   you had -- you sustained a head injury in that accident?

          15   Is that what you want to tell us?

          16   A.     Yeah.  And it would have to be more than 20 years.

          17   Q.     More than 20 years ago?

          18   A.     The date is -- just eludes me.

          19   Q.     Understood.

          20   A.     But I'm -- I'm looking at past events --

          21   Q.     Yes.

          22   A.     -- friends that have long been deceased before that

          23   time, so I'm -- in my mind, I'm weighing it as episodes.

          24   Q.     And you -- this accident that occurred more than 20

          25   years ago, you sustained a head jury?
                                                                     16



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     Did you sustain any other injuries, if you

           3   remember?

           4   A.     Maybe shoulder.

           5   Q.     Shoulder?

           6   A.     Uh-huh.

           7   Q.     Which shoulder?

           8   A.     Right shoulder.

           9   Q.     All right.  Do you know where this -- this auto

          10   accident occurred that you were involved in generally?

          11   Was that --

          12   A.     In Philadelphia.

          13   Q.     Philadelphia.  Do you know what -- do you have --

          14   do you have an exact location?

          15   A.     Sure.

          16   Q.     Where was it?

          17   A.     On Grays Ferry Avenue --

          18   Q.     Yes.

          19   A.     -- in -- in Philadelphia, around 33rd.

          20   Q.     And what happened?  Were you rear-ended?

          21   A.     No.  I was with a senior man.  He was 20 years my

          22   senior.  And we were -- we just stopped for gas.  We came

          23   out from the gas station lot, and they -- the gas company

          24   truck plowed into us from the side.

          25   Q.     Your vehicle was stopped in the -- in the gas
                                                                     17



           1   station; is that it?

           2   A.     No.  It was coming off the driveway, onto the

           3   street.

           4   Q.     Right.

           5   A.     And a -- a car convened and hit us.

           6   Q.     Was your vehicle stopped at the incident of impact,

           7   the vehicle that you were in?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Were you driving?

          10   A.     No.  A friend of mines was -- Mr. Basil Harrison.

          11   Q.     All right.

          12   A.     He's long been deceased now.

          13   Q.     Understood.  And you were the passenger?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Did you require any surgery from that accident?

          16   A.     Not -- no surgery.

          17   Q.     No?  And -- and you sustained a head injury from

          18   that accident?

          19   A.     That's correct.

          20   Q.     Did you receive any kind of treatment for that --

          21   medical treatment for that accident?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Was that with a neurologist or someone that would

          24   help you with your head injury?

          25   A.     Sure.
                                                                     18



           1   Q.     Do you remember the name of the doctor or doctors

           2   that -- any doctors that treated you for this accident?

           3   A.     Yes, Cecil Harrison.

           8   A.     Neurologist.

           9   Q.     Neurologist, all right.  Did you recover from the

          10   injuries from that auto accident?

          11   A.     Yes, I have.

          12   Q.     Did you have -- ever have any cognitive impairment

          13   as a result of that accident, that is to say, you know,

          14   memory loss or maybe inability to concentrate or this sort

          15   of thing following that accident?

          16   A.     No.  I was cleared up.  I had some -- maybe some

          17   trauma to the head.

          18   Q.     Right.

          19   A.     But after that, taking medications, some -- what --

          20   whatever the doctor gave me -- I couldn't recall it now --

          21   but everything subsided within six months.

          22   Q.     What you want us to know is you recovered about six

          23   months after that accident that occurred more than twenty

          24   years ago; is that right?

          25   A.     That's correct.
                                                                     19

          21   A.     -- granted me the medical.  But they said -- as far

          22   as the claim, that being as it is, they said, "You can't

          23   sue the city."

          24   Q.     The city -- they city was one of the defendants in

          25   the case?
                                                                     21

           3   Q.     As you sit here today, are you taking any kind of

          11   A.     I -- I can't recall.

          12   Q.     That's fine.  Is there any other lawsuits that

          13   you've been involved in in your life, you know, other than

          14   child support.  We don't need to know about that or -- is

          15   there any other lawsuits you've been involved in

          16   business-wise or auto, slip and fall?

          17   A.     It might have been going past the 20 years.  I -- I

          18   don't know.  I can't -- you know, I was a young man.  I

          19   get -- I was injured in an accident myself where a trolley

          20   car hit me.

          21   Q.     Do you know what -- what year that was?

          22   A.     Oh, god.  All right.  That was 20 years ago, was

          23   the last accident.  And that would have had to have been

          24   20 years before that.

          25   Q.     So maybe even as much as 40 years ago?
                                                                     26



           1   A.     There you go.

           2   Q.     Where'd that take place, in Philadelphia?

           4   Q.     You know where -- what street?

           5   A.     On Lancaster Avenue.

           8   A.     Right.

           9   Q.     Actually, I think there still might be some

          10   trolleys on Lancaster Ave.

          11   A.     Yes.  They're still running.

          12   Q.     Yeah.  Do you -- did you bring a -- a lawsuit

          13   against -- I guess that would have been SEPTA?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     I don't know if they called it SEPTA then.

          16   A.     Yeah.  Well -- yeah, it was SEPTA then.

          17   Q.     Yeah?  All right.  And they have -- did you recover

          18   money damages in that --

          19   A.     Yes, I did.

          20   Q.     What -- what were your injuries in that case, sir?

          21   A.     I -- that was first thought of -- of my accident,

          22   and I injured my chest and heart.

          23   Q.     You injured your chest and heart?

          24   A.     Yeah.

          25   Q.     Did you have any surgery as a result of that
                                                                     27



           1   accident, sir?

           2   A.     No.  No.  That's when I first learned I had an

           3   enlarged heart.

           4   Q.     That's when you first learned you had an enlarged

           5   heart?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     So maybe there was some benefit there, 'cause if

           8   you hadn't had that accident, you would not have learned

           9   that you had an enlarged heart.

          10   A.     That's correct.

          11   Q.     And once you learned that you had an enlarged

          12   heart, then did you have to take medications and the like?

          13   A.     No.  I just had to be careful.

          14   Q.     Right.  Okay.  And you -- I think -- and do you

          15   remember the name of -- did you have an attorney relative

          16   to that case?  I know it's way back.

          17   A.     Sure.  Sure.

          18   Q.     Could you -- could you possibly remember that

          19   attorney's name?  And if you can't, it's no big thing.

          20   A.     Yeah.  That's a good friend of mine, Allan Jaffe.

          21   Q.     Allan Jaffe?

          22   A.     Yeah.

          23   Q.     Yeah.  I think he --

          24   A.     He's a president judge now for arbitration.

          25   Q.     He -- he's a -- he's a judge?
                                                                     28

           3   A.     Yes, he is.

           4   Q.     Yeah.  But I think he's a senior judge, right?

           5   A.     Yes, he is.  I just talked to him about last year

           6   at this time.

           7   Q.     Yeah.

           8   A.     We're good friends.

           9   Q.     All right.  So is there any other accidents that

          10   you were involved in in your life?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     Did you ever bring any Workers' Compensation claims

          13   in your life?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     All right.  So we're -- I'm gonna ask you about the

          16   statement that you -- that you gave, Mr. Rudd.

          19   A.     Yes, I do.

          23   investigator from the firm.

          24   Q.     From -- from Mr. O'Donnell's firm?

          25   A.     That's correct.
                                                                     29



           1   Q.     And was -- is it your understanding that there was

           2   a recorded transcription of this statement?  Is that what

           3   you're telling us?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     Do you have a copy of the recorded transcription?

           6   I mean do you have a copy of the recording?

          17   Q.     All right.  The -- the words that are -- this is a

          18   five-page document.  Are these all your words, or are they

          19   someone else's words that you signed?

          25   Q.     Before this case occurred, did you know
                                                                     30

          23   accident too?

          24   A.     He's alluding to that, yes.

          25   Q.     Understood.  Well, what I'm trying to get to is

          19   Q.     And through Omar, you -- you got to meet Marvin?

          20   A.     That's correct.

          21   Q.     All right.  Who -- who is older, Omar or Marvin?

          22   A.     Marvin is -- Omar is older.

          23   Q.     And then apparently, unfortunately, Omar passed

          24   away?

          25   A.     That's correct.
                                                                     32



           1   Q.     Do you know what the cause of death was?

           2   A.     Cause of death was diabetes.

           3   Q.     And subsequent to the death of Omar Bassett, you

           4   became even more friendly with Marvin Bassett.  Is that

           5   true?

           6   A.     Right after that, yes.

           7   Q.     Yeah.  And you indicated that Marvin came to you

           8   for moral support following the death of his brother,

           9   Omar?

          10   A.     Uh-huh.

          11   Q.     All right.  And so what you indicated here is

          12   Marvin would come to see you in Philadelphia, spend the

          13   day together?

          14   A.     That's correct.

          15   Q.     Before Mr. -- before Omar died, did you have any

          16   interaction with Marvin, or he was just a brother of one

          17   of your friends?

          18   A.     Well, when I met Marvin through his brother, me and

          19   his brother was avid weightlifting.  I was making my

          20   recovery as to the stroke, and we teamed up in the gym,

          21   and we became avid weightlifters.

          22   Q.     But is it -- who's "we"?  You and who?

          23   A.     Me and his brother, Omar.

          24   Q.     I see.  Okay.  So Omar passes, and then you develop

          25   a relationship with Marvin?
                                                                     33



           1   A.     That's correct.

           2   Q.     And you indicated Marvin would come to see you in

           3   Philadelphia and would spend the entire day?

           4   A.     Uh-huh.

           5   Q.     From his -- do you know where he lives?

           6   A.     Do I know where --

           7   Q.     He -- Marvin lived in -- lives in Kingston,

           8   Pennsylvania?

           9   A.     That's correct.

          10   Q.     Have you ever been to Marvin's home in Kingston?

          11   A.     No, I haven't.

          12   Q.     No?  So when -- whenever you would have interaction

          13   with Marvin, he would come here to Philadelphia and --

          14   A.     Sure.

          15   Q.     -- visit you, right?

          16   A.     Yes.  He was lamenting over the death of his

          17   brother.  It was quite shocking to him.  And our -- our

          18   friendship had just start to -- to build.  And so he came

          19   looking to -- for -- to -- for me to ask more about his

          20   brother and what was the actual causes.

          21                  'Cause Marvin had separated from his wife

          22   and got into the streets.  It was drug use.  And the

          23   girlfriend that he was going with used drugs, so it was

          24   coupled with the drugs and the -- the diabetes.  And far

          25   as I'm concerned, Omar couldn't face the reality of
                                                                     34



           1   being -- have to depending on the medication with the

           2   diabetes.  So he, you know, being an athlete -- and he was

           3   actually a serviceman, the Navy SEALs, so he couldn't

           4   fathom with that.

           5                  And I learned late that he was going

           6   through this.  And then, he started to deal with the

           7   drugs, and so that put us at a loss.  He hid the drugs,

           8   and the diabetes caught up with him.  And so

           9   painstakingly, it was a result of a bad cause of death.

          10   Q.     Understood.  And we -- we appreciate that

          11   information.

          12   A.     Sure.

          13   Q.     And -- and that's good background information.

          14   Our -- our main concern is your -- your connection and --

          15   A.     Sure.

          16   Q.     -- and your interaction with Marvin.  Although,

          17   that's a good -- you just did give us some good background

          18   there.

          19                  What you want us to know is Marvin Bassett,

          20   after his brother died, he would -- he would come to

          21   Philadelphia and spend the day with you?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Would he ever spend the night at your house, or

          24   would he just drive back to Kingston?

          25   A.     He would go back to Kingston.
                                                                     35



           1   Q.     Did he drive to Philadelphia when he came to see

           2   you?

           3   A.     Some of the time.

           4   Q.     How else would he get there, you know?  Or -- he

           5   had public transit?

           6   A.     I'm not sure.  But most of the time, he drove.

           7   Q.     Yeah.  I mean 'cause from -- from Kingston so your

           8   address, that's at least a two-hour drive.

           9   A.     Sure it is.

          10   Q.     You know, that's up in Luzerne County, right near

          11   Wilkes-Barre, you know?

          12   A.     Yes.  And I made the statement in the transcript

          13   here that he would leave late at night from my home

          14   because traffic was light.  And he -- and he would be able

          15   to, in his condition, put on cruise control, drive with

          16   his left foot, and -- and get on -- and we would actually

          17   monitor each other's -- in a conversation through phone

          18   while he's riding in the --

          19   Q.     Understood.  And you -- and you did indicate that

          20   in your statement.  And what you're telling us here in the

          21   statement is Marvin would come to Philadelphia after the

          22   death of his -- of -- excuse me.

          23                  MR. O'DONNELL:  Is that your call?

          24                  MR. CRANE:  No, not yet.  I just want to

          25   keep going.
                                                                     36



           1   BY MR. CRANE:

           2   Q.     You -- you -- you did indicate after the death of

           3   Marvin -- after the death of Omar, Marvin would come to

           4   see you every three months or so?

           5   A.     That's correct.

           6   Q.     And you -- you became friends?

           7   A.     Yes, we did.

           8   Q.     And you would also speak to him over the phone?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     All right.  Now, before this accident that brings

          11   us here today -- are you aware of the date of the accident

          12   that brings us here today?

          13   A.     I -- I can't really call, but I knew it was -- I'm

          14   looking at the month of April.

          15   Q.     Okay.

          16   A.     You know?

          17   Q.     Well -- well, let me just -- let me help you out.

          18   And this is not a test.

          19   A.     Sure.

          20   Q.     Mr. Bassett got injured on February 27, 2018, all

          21   right?  And so really the question I have is:  Before

          22   2/27/18 -- and you've indicated in here you -- Marvin was

          23   very active.  Is that what you want us to know?

          24   A.     That's correct.

          25   Q.     And what -- when you say "very active," what does
                                                                     37



           1   that mean?  What would he do?

           2   A.     Well, he took up after his brother.  His brother

           3   introduced him to me and let him know that we're buddies

           4   and we're also into fitness training, weightlifting,

           5   jogging, things like that.

           6                  So he -- again, looking back, Marvin would

           7   you say, "Wait 'til you meet my younger brother.  He's

           8   just like me," you know?  And we were gym rats, you know?

           9   We just go at it.  We work hard.

          10   Q.     Where -- what gyms -- what gym would you go to?

          11   A.     I would go to the YMCA.

          12   Q.     Which one?

          13   A.     52nd and Sansom.

          14   Q.     Yes.

          15   A.     We also, at that time, me and Marvin, we went

          16   somewhere in South Philly at a gym.

          17   Q.     Do you know the name of that gym?

          18   A.     I can't recall it now.

          19   Q.     And when you and Marvin would go to these gyms --

          20   remember, we're -- we're talking about before the accident

          21   now --

          22   A.     Uh-huh.

          23   Q.     -- what would he do, physically do?

          24   A.     Well, again, I'm talking about his brother.

          25   Q.     Omar.
                                                                     38



           1   A.     Omar.

           2   Q.     So let me stop you for a second.  I -- maybe I

           3   confused -- I confused you.  Did you go to this gym in

           4   South Philadelphia with Marvin?

           5   A.     No.  I went to with Omar.  But I was alleviating

           6   (sic) to that when Marvin comes on the scene, Omar tells

           7   me that his brother also fitness trained.  And so when we

           8   started to get together our friendship, we continued on

           9   with fitness training with Marvin because of his --

          10   Q.     Understood.

          11   A.      -- introduction to me at that time from his

          12   brother.

          13   Q.     Understood.

          14   A.     So...

          15   Q.     And where would you and Marvin do fitness training?

          16   A.     Okay.  The YMCA.

          17   Q.     The YMCA at 52nd and Sansom?

          18   A.     That's correct.

          19   Q.     Any other location?

          20   A.     Most of our stuff was outside training.

          21   Q.     Outside such as -- what would you do --

          22   A.     And we would -- we would go in the park.

          23   Q.     You're talking about in Fairmount Park?

          24   A.     Fairmount Park.  I would take him around the drive.

          25   Me and Omar used to ride the drive.
                                                                     39



           1   Q.     Yes.

           2   A.     I mean work out on the drive.  And we -- it was a

           3   lot of outside training.

           4   Q.     Yeah.  You're talking about running?

           5   A.     Running, jogging.

           6   Q.     Yes.

           7   A.     Where you have pull-up bars out there.

           8   Q.     Yes.  All along at different spots, you stop --

           9   A.     Sure.

          10   Q.     -- and there's a -- there's an exercise spot?

          11   A.     Yeah.  We were doing that type of thing.  Yeah.

          12   Q.     Right.  Okay.  And you would do that with Marvin

          13   before the accident?

          14   A.     Before the accident, that's correct.

          15   Q.     And so before the accident of February 27, 2018,

          16   how often would you say you worked out with Marvin?

          17   A.     Well, when he came to -- when he --

          18   Q.     When he came to Philadelphia?

          19   A.     We would also -- we would do outside activity --

          20   Q.     I understand.

          21   A.     -- running, jogging, biking, stuff like that.

          22   Q.     And what you want us to know:  He would come --

          23   he -- Marvin would come maybe every three months and visit

          24   you in Philadelphia?

          25   A.     That's correct.
                                                                     40



           1   Q.     And when he -- when he would come, how -- for

           2   example, how much distance would you and he run, you and

           3   Marvin run?  Could you give us a range that he was able to

           4   run?

           5   A.     Yeah.  At least two miles.

           6   Q.     The purpose of all these questions, just so you

           7   know, Mr. Rudd, is I -- I want -- we want to find out what

           8   you can tell us about the physical conditioning of Marvin

           9   before the accident.  And then we're gonna ask you about

          10   the physical conditioning of Marvin after the accident

          11   that might have been diminished due to the accident.  This

          12   is the essential reason why you're here as a witness.

          13   A.     I understand.

          14   Q.     So that's -- I'm trying to extract some details

          15   from you relative to the training, and you just gave us

          16   some details relative to running.

          17   A.     Right.

          18   Q.     You -- whenever Marvin would come to visit you in

          19   Philadelphia, you would -- you would run at least two

          20   miles up in Fairmount Park.

          21   A.     Sure.

          22   Q.     And then, you would stop and work out at the

          23   workout spots.

          24   A.     Uh-huh.

          25   Q.     I think you can do sit-ups, right?  You can do
                                                                     41



           1   pull-ups.

           2   A.     You can do everything there.

           3   Q.     Well, you can't lift weights out there.

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     No.  But --

           6   A.     But with -- sometimes, we -- I did have weights in

           7   the car though.

           8   Q.     Understood.  But then, when you would go to the

           9   YMCA, you and Marvin, at the 52nd and Sansom, what would

          10   you do there when he would come?

          11   A.     There, it was more or less, what? light training,

          12   like light weight training.

          13   Q.     Light weight training?

          14   A.     Uh-huh.

          15   Q.     All right.  Would you -- would you happen to be

          16   able to estimate the weight of Marvin before the accident?

          17   A.     His weight?

          18   Q.     His weight, yeah, before the accident.  If you

          19   don't -- if you don't know, that's fine.  And if you're

          20   gonna guess, we really would rather not hear it; but if

          21   you can reasonably estimate, we'd like to hear that.

          22   A.     I would estimate 150 pounds.

          23   Q.     A hundred and fifty pounds.  And then, after the

          24   accident occurred, did you -- did you notice any kind of

          25   weight gain on Marvin?
                                                                     42



           1   A.     Not gained, but lost.

           2   Q.     He lost weight?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     Why -- why do you -- why do you think he lost

           5   weight?

           6   A.     I don't know.

           7   Q.     You don't know?

           8   A.     I couldn't answer that.

           9   Q.     Do you have any information or knowledge that

          10   Marvin might have used some drugs or anything of that

          11   nature?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     Do you have any information at any time that Marvin

          14   had ever been convicted of a crime of dishonesty?

          15   A.     Not to -- to my knowledge.

          16   Q.     Right.

          17   A.     Can I be excused?  I need to go to the bathroom.

          18                  MR. CRANE:  Absolutely.

          19                  (Recess was taken from 10:46 a.m. to 10:51

          20   a.m.)

          21                  MR. CRANE:  What was the -- what was the

          22   last area of inquiry?

          23                  (The court reporter read back the record as

          24   requested.)

          25   BY MR. CRANE:
                                                                     43



           1   Q.     You -- I'm just going down through your statement,

           2   Mr. Rudd.  You've indicated you -- you thought that Marvin

           3   was athletic before the accident?

           4   A.     Of course.

           5   Q.     And you -- and you just gave us some information in

           6   that regard, but let me inquire a little further.  When

           7   you say "athletic," do you have any information or

           8   knowledge that Marvin was -- was involved in any

           9   professional athletics or -- or college or high school?

          10   What do you know about his athletic abilities other than

          11   what you've told us regarding his working -- working out

          12   with you?

          13   A.     No, just from me observing him.

          14   Q.     Okay.  All right.  And you indicated you would park

          15   the car and just begin to walk, I guess, around

          16   Philadelphia.  You would do sightseeing with him?

          17   A.     Uh-huh.

          18   Q.     And before the accident that brings us here today,

          19   did Marvin have any trouble walking?

          20   A.     Oh, definitely so.

          21   Q.     He had trouble walking before -- now, remember,

          22   listen.  Before the accident.

          23   A.     No.  No.  No.  I'm sorry.

          24   Q.     That's all right.  And before the 2/27/18 accident,

          25   what you want us to know is Marvin had no trouble walking,
                                                                     44



           1   correct?

           2   A.     Before that?

           3   Q.     Before the accident.

           4   A.     That's correct.

           5   Q.     And Marvin had no trouble running before the

           6   accident?

           7   A.     Yes.  Yes.

           8   Q.     Now, you were -- you were -- you were able to tell

           9   us your first-hand observations when Marvin would come to

          10   Philadelphia a couple times a year, maybe four or five

          11   times a year.  Do you have any information of what Marvin

          12   would do when he was at his home in Kingston, what his

          13   workout regimen was -- was before the accident?  Do you

          14   have any information in that regard or no?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     What would he tell you?

          17   A.     He would tell me he would run.  He's always stayed

          18   active.  He told me he would ride his bike also.

          19   Q.     Would he ever tell you how far he would ride his

          20   bike?

          21   A.     He would say like sometimes he'd do a mile or five

          22   miles.

          23   Q.     Right.  And how about how far would he run?  Not

          24   when you were watching him, you know, when he came to

          25   Philadelphia, but in Kingston up in Luzerne County, do you
                                                                     45



           1   know?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     But he did tell you he would do running?

           4   A.     Uh-huh.

           5   Q.     Did he lift weights or anything of that nature when

           6   he was up in Kingston, if you know?

           7   A.     I wouldn't -- I wouldn't know.

           8   Q.     You wouldn't know that?  Do you know if he was --

           9   A.     But, I think, in passing, he would say, "I'm just

          10   like my brother.  I lift weights.  I jog."  So it was

          11   believable because when we were together, we did a

          12   continuation of what his brother did.

          13   Q.     Right.

          14   A.     And we also did --

          15   Q.     Well, and that would make perfect sense.  I mean

          16   it -- you know, you're giving us some information:  He

          17   would come down and visit you once every three months or

          18   so.  And -- and that creates the inference that he can --

          19   he works out at his home.

          20   A.     Sure.  He was just --

          21   Q.     And I --

          22   A.     Sure.  He was just like his brother, spitting image

          23   of his brother.  The younger brother -- you know the

          24   younger brother always try to implement the things that

          25   his older brother would do.
                                                                     46



           1   Q.     Understood.  And -- and that's a reasonable

           2   inference.  And I was just trying to extract any details

           3   that you might have in that regard relative to activities

           4   that Marvin would do in his home.  And you've given us

           5   some information.  But you -- what you do want us to know

           6   is you -- you were never -- you never visited Marvin in

           7   his home in Kingston, PA; is that correct?

           8   A.     Yeah.  Because we -- we were going to get to that

           9   point, but, again, the accident caused that --

          10   Q.     All right.

          11   A.     -- aspect of our living --

          12   Q.     Do you know if Marvin was married?

          13   A.     No, he's not married.

          14   Q.     Did he have any kids, do you know?

          15   A.     Not that I know, no.

          16   Q.     Is it your understanding that he lived alone in

          17   Kingston?

          18   A.     That's correct.

          19   Q.     And when you would -- you -- you gave us some

          20   information about when Marvin would come here before the

          21   accident and run at Fairmount Park.  And you said you

          22   would run a couple miles.

          23   A.     Uh-huh.

          24   Q.     When -- when you were walking around town in

          25   Philadelphia, sightseeing and so forth, how far would you
                                                                     47



           1   think you would walk when he would come?

           2   A.     We have outdoors events, like I said.  If he came

           3   down early in the day, we -- we would hit Fairmount Park

           4   and do -- like I said, do the circle --

           5   Q.     Yes.

           6   A.     -- around Lincoln Drive --

           7   Q.     Yes.

           8   A.     -- and exercise like that, run, jog.  And we -- for

           9   our cool-down period, we would get back in the car, go in

          10   town and walk.  We went South Street --

          11   Q.     Yes.

          12   A.     -- Penn's landing --

          13   Q.     Yes.

          14   A.     -- around the art museum --

          15   Q.     Yes.

          16   A.     -- places like that, more outdoorsy stuff, moving,

          17   you know, and doing things.

          18   Q.     Yes.  Okay.  Then there came -- you also pointed

          19   out that Marvin loved cars.

          20   A.     He loves cars.

          21   Q.     And so before the accident, he -- would he work on

          22   cars?  Did -- what did he do?  Did he build engines?  What

          23   is your knowledge in that regard?

          24   A.     He can do everything with a car.

          25   Q.     Did you ever see him do things on a car?
                                                                     48



           1   A.     Sure.

           2   Q.     What did you see?

           3   A.     Well, every time I seen him, he had the hood up.

           4   He would stop and pull over to the side, flip the hood up,

           5   and doing something.  "Oh, I got to fix this and this

           6   here.  This is not acting like" -- everything.

           7                  I don't care what it was.  If the -- if the

           8   tailpipe had a little tinge on it, he would get under

           9   there and fix it right -- "Oh, I can fix this in two

          10   minutes.  Give me two minutes."  Or "I don't like to hear

          11   this on my car," anything with his car.  His brother was

          12   the same way.

          13   Q.     Understood.  Did -- did Marvin own a number of

          14   cars, as far as you know, or not?

          15   A.     I think he had a number of cars.

          16   Q.     When Marvin would drive down to Philadelphia to see

          17   you, do you recall what kind of cars he would drive?  Can

          18   you give us the names or types of cars that he would

          19   drive?

          20   A.     He had a -- a Lincoln, going back.  I don't -- I

          21   seen that maybe one time.

          22   Q.     Was that a big sedan, a four-door sedan?

          23   A.     It might have been a two-door.

          24   Q.     Two-door, right.  Okay.

          25   A.     And then, he had a little -- I think he had a
                                                                     49



           1   Toyota.

           2   Q.     A Toyota?

           3   A.     It was a little, red car.

           4   Q.     Yeah.

           5   A.     And he would fix everything.  It ran smoothly.

           6   Q.     Do you know if he ever fixed cars for other people,

           7   or did he just fix his own car?

           8   A.     He fixed other cars for other people.

           9   Q.     Do -- did he ever do that to make money, earning --

          10   fixing cars, if you know?

          11   A.     Well, not professionally, just helping out and

          12   helping a friend out.  And sometimes he would go around

          13   the mechanics that would need his assistance, and -- and

          14   they work things out together.

          15   Q.     Understood.  And so after this accident, after

          16   2/27/18, do you have any information or knowledge as to

          17   how this accident affected Mr. Marvin, how it affected his

          18   ability to work on vehicles or --

          19   A.     Oh, tremendously.

          20   Q.     What -- what were the details?  What -- what do you

          21   mean by that?

          22   A.     Well, as I said in the statement, he would work on

          23   the car from bumper to bumper.

          24   Q.     Yes.

          25   A.     Now, the -- the things that he would like to do --
                                                                     50



           1   matter fact, I -- I recall one time, I had a '89 Cadillac.

           2   Q.     1989 Cadillac?

           3   A.     Yeah.  And the -- the engine was overheating.  And

           4   with that year, the -- the manifold block had a seal on

           5   it.  And those things would break, you know, bust if you

           6   didn't get the right type of fluid or just mundanely.  It

           7   was just the cars that -- it was actually a defect, as

           8   I'm -- I'm concerned.

           9                  But he would tell me that he could go in

          10   there if I brought the car -- get it towed up there, he

          11   would be able to fix that.

          12   Q.     Right.

          13   A.     I said, "I don't want to put that much money into

          14   an old car like that."  And -- and some mechanics could do

          15   it.  They're worth they weight when they do something like

          16   that --

          17   Q.     Yes.

          18   A.     -- put a seal in from a --

          19   Q.     Yeah.

          20   A.     -- an engine.  So he was willing to do that.

          21   Q.     Well, what you want us to know is that before the

          22   accident, part of Marvin's joy in life was to repair cars?

          23   A.     Still -- still is.

          24   Q.     And so even after the accident, he still repair car

          25   -- he still --
                                                                     51



           1   A.     No, he doesn't do it.  But I'm saying his love

           2   of -- of cars -- he still talk to -- I just talked to him

           3   last night.  He was telling me about fixing a car.  He

           4   can't even get out of bed.

           5   Q.     So what you want us to know:  He still loves cars,

           6   but he's not able to fix those cars anymore as a result of

           7   this accident?  Is that what you're --

           8   A.     That's -- that's his old dream.

           9   Q.     Is -- is -- is, as far as you know, Mr. Marvin's

          10   inability to or -- or incapability to work on cars a

          11   result of this accident?

          12   A.     That's correct.

          13   Q.     All right.  And has Mr. -- has Marvin told you that

          14   he's been unable to work on cars since the accident?

          15   A.     Every time I talk to him.

          16   Q.     All right.  There apparently was a period of time

          17   that Marvin walked with crutches?

          18   A.     Uh-huh.

          19   Q.     Do -- did you ever see him walking with crutches?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     So what you want us to know is when Marvin would

          22   come and visit you, he would have crutches and would be

          23   walking around on crutches; is that right?

          24   A.     Yeah.  The first time I seen Marvin, he told me

          25   about the accident.  That's why I alluded to April --
                                                                     52



           1   Q.     Right.

           2   A.     -- because I think he had some injury.  He said,

           3   "Bob, I've been in an accident."

           4   Q.     Right.

           5   A.     So when I see him in April and he -- I -- I live

           6   three blocks from the corner.  When he turned that corner

           7   with a crutch under his arm, I said, "Oh my god."

           8   Q.     I see what you're saying.

           9   A.     You know?

          10   Q.     What you -- what you've just told us is this

          11   accident happened in February of '18; and then in maybe of

          12   April of '18, he came to visit you in Philadelphia, and

          13   you saw him with crutches?

          14   A.     That's correct.

          15   Q.     And -- and -- and is that -- and that's when you

          16   first learned or you first -- that's the first time you

          17   saw Marvin subsequent to the accident?

          18   A.     Yeah, at that -- yeah.  Sure.

          19   Q.     How many times do you think you've seen him in

          20   total -- since 2/27/18, Mr. Rudd, how many times do you

          21   think you have physically seen Mr. Bassett?  An estimate,

          22   range.

          23   A.     I would say approximately about 20 times.

          24   Q.     Twenty times, okay.  And all of those times are in

          25   Philadelphia, right?
                                                                     53



           1   A.     Yeah.  Matter fact, I went through the whole course

           2   of him with the accident, walking -- you know, going with

           3   him to the doctors --

           4   Q.     Okay.  What --

           5   A.     -- going with him to the supermarket.  I really

           6   lived the life that he wanted to live at that time.

           7   Q.     Well, I'll ask you about that.  I have some

           8   questions, and it might be other questions.

           9   A.     Sure.

          10   Q.     We'll -- we'll ask you about what your knowledge is

          11   of his treatment and so forth.  I just want to just finish

          12   up with this statement.

          13   A.     No problem.

          14   Q.     Okay?  I'm just -- you can see I'm just reading

          15   down through the statement.

          16   A.     Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.

          17   Q.     And I almost got to the part where you first saw

          18   him where -- using crutches and that when Marvin comes to

          19   visit you, you have to help raise his right foot?

          20   A.     That's correct.

          21   Q.     Right.  That's -- you know, that -- you understand

          22   that he broke his right toe in this accident?

          23   A.     Uh-huh.

          24   Q.     Yeah.

          25   A.     I think so.
                                                                     54



           1   Q.     And you were -- you were aware that Mr. -- that he

           2   did have surgery?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     All right.  I think the surgery was on 8/1/18.

           5   A.     Okay.

           6   Q.     And I'll ask you about your knowledge about the

           7   injury and so forth.  There's a statement in here, though,

           8   that you indicate that Marvin fears that he will be

           9   permanently crippled.  Did he tell you that?  What did he

          10   tell you?

          11   A.     Yes.  He -- he -- he told me what the doctor said,

          12   and I was there in the room when the doctor gave him his

          13   prognosis.

          14   Q.     What -- what was the name of that doctor, do you

          15   know?

          16   A.     Dr. Mann.

          17   Q.     Dr. Mann?

          18   A.     Uh-huh, from Philadelphia.

          19   Q.     All right.  And can you tell us what that doctor --

          20   whatever you overheard or -- or what Marvin told you?

          21   A.     Well, we heard it at the same time.

          22   Q.     What did you hear?

          23   A.     He -- he -- Marvin was worried about his -- before

          24   the operation --

          25   Q.     Yes.
                                                                     55



           1   A.     -- on his toe, he searched and found Dr. Mann, a

           2   very gifted doctor.

           3   Q.     Yes.

           4   A.     And he gave him the prognosis of:  "Okay.  Your toe

           5   is broken.  I can repair it," right?

           6   Q.     Yes.

           7   A.     "You're not gonna be as good as new."  So the

           8   doctor said, "Well, since you did your research" -- 'cause

           9   Marvin did the research on -- and he wanted the -- the

          10   titanium screw put in the foot.  And he rejected the

          11   doctor's prognosis in his hometown of --

          12   Q.     Kingston?

          13   A.     Kingston.

          14   Q.     Or up thereabouts.

          15   A.     Yeah.  'Cause using that doctor's operation, he

          16   would be immobile.  And Marvin couldn't -- painstakingly,

          17   he couldn't deal with that.

          18   Q.     He did not want to be immobile?

          19   A.     Yeah.  So...

          20   Q.     So you -- Dr. Mann, is that a male or a female, do

          21   you know?

          22   A.     A male.

          23   Q.     You -- you happen to know that person's first name

          24   or not?  Doesn't really matter.  If you don't, that's

          25   fine.
                                                                     56



           1   A.     No, I don't.

           2   Q.     But anyway, your -- you -- you and Marvin are

           3   talking to Dr. Mann, I guess, in Dr. Mann's office?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     And Dr. Mann is explaining to you before the

           6   surgery that Marvin has a broken toe and ways that he can

           7   repair it?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     And you gave us some information that Marvin wanted

          10   what's called -- you know, he wanted internal fixation, a

          11   titanium screw put in?

          12   A.     That's correct.

          13   Q.     And the reason -- did --

          14   A.     He said that would give him more ability to move

          15   his toe over --

          16   Q.     Dr. Mann said that?

          17   A.     -- over a period of time.  Yeah.

          18   Q.     Yeah.

          19   A.     He would -- he wouldn't gain full recovery of it,

          20   but he would have a -- a chance to be more mobile.  And

          21   the toe would -- after a while, he wouldn't recognize the

          22   disablement, but it would always be there.  So he

          23   didn't -- he didn't exaggerate on it.

          24   Q.     But then -- and we appreciate that information

          25   there.  The sentence that I'm looking at that you wrote:
                                                                     57



           1   "Marvin feared that" -- "feared that he would be

           2   permanently crippled."  I'm -- I'm on page two.  It's

           3   like -- one, two, three, four -- five lines from the

           4   bottom, sir.

           5   A.     Uh-huh.

           6   Q.     And you wrote that Marvin feared that he would be

           7   permanently crippled.

           8   A.     Yeah.

           9   Q.     And what is it that, you know -- what is it that

          10   motivated you to write that?  Did Marvin say that to you?

          11   A.     Yeah.  That was --

          12   Q.     Or did you draw a conclusion?

          13   A.     No.  That's -- that was his fear.  He told me that

          14   straight away.  Most of the time, he talked about that.

          15   And he said, "Bob, I don't want to be a cripple."

          16   Q.     I gotcha.

          17   A.     And -- and he said, "That's why I rejected the

          18   other doctor's prognosis, because he tell me that I would

          19   be immobile.  I can't have that."  And -- and, in my

          20   words, that messed his mind up.

          21   Q.     Understood.  Did you have anything to do with

          22   getting Marvin in to see Dr. Mann, or he do that on his

          23   own?  Or how do you know he got to see Dr. Mann?

          24   A.     Well, he -- he -- he researched and found it on his

          25   own.
                                                                     58



           1   Q.     Right.

           2   A.     And he believed in Dr. Mann's prognosis, and he --

           3   he trusted him.

           4   Q.     Yes.

           5   A.     And...

           6   Q.     Did Dr. Mann do the surgery?

           7   A.     Yes, he did.

           8   Q.     Were you at the hospital when the surgery was being

           9   done?

          10   A.     No.  That particular day, I missed.

          11   Q.     And you did indicate:  "The thought of Marvin being

          12   permanently crippled has messed him up psychologically."

          13   A.     Right.

          14   Q.     When you say that, when -- "messed him up

          15   psychologically," could -- can you give us some details in

          16   that regard.  What is it you meant by that?

          17   A.     Okay.  Depression.

          18   Q.     Gotcha.  Understood.

          19   A.     I would -- I'm not a doctor, but --

          20   Q.     Understood.  But you -- you're his friend.

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     And you're -- we're asking you these questions

          23   'cause we want to hear what you have to say.

          24   A.     Sure.

          25   Q.     Go ahead.
                                                                     59



           1   A.     From a psychological standpoint, his mind wasn't

           2   together.  It -- it -- I wasn't seeing the Marvin that I

           3   seen before.  And I could see on his face the worry, the

           4   depression.  We would -- a lot of times, we would go out

           5   to eat.  It -- it wasn't enthusiastic like before.

           6                  Everybody is crazy about the Philadelphia

           7   steak sandwich.

           8   Q.     Yes.

           9   A.     So when he gets down this way, he's:  "Where can we

          10   get that steak sandwich, Bob?"

          11   Q.     Yes.

          12   A.     "You know all the good restaurants.  Come on," you

          13   know?  Even when we did it, it wasn't the same enthusiasm,

          14   you know?

          15                  'Cause that would bring joy like a little

          16   kid to his -- you know?  And so I tried to do the

          17   fun-filled things that we used to do, and it wasn't

          18   hitting.

          19   Q.     Yes.

          20   A.     So I know good and well that it's depression of --

          21   of -- of his foot being broken -- toe being broken and

          22   other things psychologically that -- that's weighing on

          23   him.

          24   Q.     Did -- after the accident, did Mr. -- did Marvin

          25   limp?
                                                                     60



           1   A.     Oh, definitely so.

           2   Q.     Does he still limp even to this day?

           3   A.     Yes.  Yes.

           4   Q.     How would you describe -- what words would you use

           5   to describe that limp, if you could?  I mean we -- and we

           6   all have an idea of what a limp is.

           7   A.     It's just like what he said.

           8   Q.     Would you say "severe" or "moderate"?  Or what word

           9   would you want to use to describe his limp?

          10   A.     I would say severe, and I would use the same words

          11   that it's alluding to here in the paragraph, "cripple."

          12   Q.     Cripple, okay.  Did -- did Marvin limp before the

          13   accident?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     No, okay.  And you -- you already told us some

          16   information relative to doctors' comments.  You wrote

          17   here:  "Doctors have even told him that he will never be a

          18   hundred percent."  Was that -- you told us what Dr. Mann

          19   told Marvin --

          20   A.     Yeah.

          21   Q.     -- that he would -- he --

          22   A.     Shit.  I was right there in the room with him when

          23   he told him that.

          24   Q.     Understood.

          25   A.     Yeah.
                                                                     61



           1   Q.     I get you.  That he wouldn't be a hundred percent,

           2   but the use of this titanium screw would provide Marvin

           3   with some movement as opposed to what the Kingston doctor

           4   was telling him?

           5   A.     Sure.  "Give you more mobility," that was his exact

           6   words.

           7   Q.     Understood.  And you -- you indicate here:  "I see

           8   and hear Marvin crying, which is something Marvin never

           9   did."  So before the accident, Marvin -- you would --

          10   never saw Marvin cry?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     But after the accident, you did?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Where would he do that, in your home?  Or how's

          15   that -- how's that work?

          16   A.     Home, in the car.

          17   Q.     But why was he crying?

          18   A.     He felt that the accident threw him a curveball --

          19   Q.     Yes.

          20   A.     -- in my words.  And he never thought he would end

          21   up like this or it would be painful as it was.

          22   Q.     Yes.  Is it your belief that Mr. -- that Marvin has

          23   had constant pain since the date of this accident?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     Yes?  Do you have any information or knowledge that
                                                                     62



           1   the surgery that was done on 8/1/18 had any beneficial

           2   effects?  I know you're not a doctor.  I'm just asking

           3   your belief.  Do you have any knowledge or information

           4   that the surgery was helpful or no?

           5   A.     I would say 50/50.

           6   Q.     You think -- what you want us so know is the

           7   surgery was -- improved his -- improved Marvin's condition

           8   50 percent?  See, that was a leading question.  You -- you

           9   can disagree with that.  I'm just trying to extract words

          10   from you, 'cause I see that you're -- you're trying to

          11   answer the question, and we appreciate that.  And it's a

          12   difficult question to ask --

          13   A.     Sure.

          14   Q.     -- and even probably more difficult to answer.

          15   A.     Yeah.

          16   Q.     Well, all right.  All we're trying to find out is:

          17   There's a surgical procedure.  You're his buddy.

          18   A.     Yeah.

          19   Q.     You're concerned for his welfare.  And of course,

          20   you know, everybody knows him, including yourself, are

          21   hoping that -- hoping that the surgery will help him.  And

          22   my -- our question to you is:  Are you able to give us any

          23   information that the surgery was helpful, that is to say

          24   reduced pain, improved mobility? or whatever words you

          25   want to use.
                                                                     63



           1   A.     Again, I would have to say 50/50.

           2   Q.     Fifty-fifty.  And when you say "50/50," what does

           3   that mean, 50/50?  It was only 50 percent -- the surgery

           4   was only 50 percent helpful?

           5   A.     That's all.

           6   Q.     Okay.  Appreciate that.  And you indicate here:

           7   "Marvin is not happy."  So is it your -- your -- your

           8   testimony that you would -- you would tell a jury, if it

           9   goes that far, a fact-finder, that since this accident,

          10   Marvin is not a happy person?

          11   A.     Not at all.

          12   Q.     And you indicate -- now I'm on page -- the top of

          13   page three, Mr. Rudd.

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     You indicate that since the accident, Marvin and

          16   you have begun to have some arguments?  Do you need to --

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Okay.  There you go.

          19   A.     Pardon me.

          20   Q.     That's all right.  I'm looking at the top of page

          21   three.

          22   A.     Uh-huh.

          23   Q.     "Since the accident, Marvin and I have begun to

          24   argue."

          25   A.     Right.
                                                                     64



           1   Q.     Did you and Marvin have any arguments before the

           2   accident?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     And so what is -- now there's an accident.  Now

           5   there's some arguments between you and Marvin.  Can you

           6   give us some details in that regard or no?

           7   A.     Yeah.

           8   Q.     Go ahead.

           9   A.     When I was talking to him, his mind is somewhere

          10   else.  And I'm telling him that he has to be more

          11   cognitive of the things around us, you know

          12   causation-wise.

          13   Q.     Yes.

          14   A.     And his mind drifts off, you know?  And I know it's

          15   geared to the pain that he's feeling --

          16   Q.     Yes.

          17   A.     -- the psychological differences.  But I'm talking

          18   about the reality, and he's somewhere thinking about his

          19   pain and off from reality.  So we argue like that.  I'll

          20   say, "You got to pay attention.  You got to" -- but I

          21   don't know that I'm being short on patience in dealing

          22   with him.

          23                  And then, when we resurrect -- as my words

          24   are, when we resurrect, we see that it's not us.  It's the

          25   feelings that he's going -- his reality versus my reality.
                                                                     65



           1   And then we come to a happy medium and then say, "Well,

           2   Bob, you know it's 'cause of the accident and my mind is

           3   all messed up."  Our words now.

           4   Q.     And you do indicate in this -- in this statement

           5   that you believe that the genesis of the -- some of the

           6   disagreements that you and -- or arguments that you and

           7   Marvin would have is due to the accident and his pain from

           8   the accident.  You indicate that Marvin can't smile,

           9   because the pain is too severe?

          10   A.     At some points.

          11   Q.     Some points.

          12   A.     He was always a happy-go-lucky --

          13   Q.     A happy guy?

          14   A.     -- person.  And you know how people, they could

          15   fill up a room with their smile.  And he was a person like

          16   that.  We were happy to see each other, you know?

          17   Q.     Yes.

          18   A.     And I didn't see the same person, you know?

          19   Q.     Yes.

          20   A.     And I tried to create that by doing the things that

          21   he liked when he came here, fun-filled things.  And still,

          22   the expression was lost in his facial expressions.

          23   Q.     And it's your belief that before the accident,

          24   Mr. -- Mr. -- Marvin's smile would be able to fill up a

          25   room, and after the accident, not so, and that's because
                                                                     66



           1   of the pain from this accident?

           2   A.     That's correct.

           3   Q.     And you indicate here that -- well, you indicate

           4   that you and Marvin "no longer walk around like we used

           5   to."  So do you -- when he comes to visit -- and does

           6   Marvin still come to visit you?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Is it still like once every three months or so or

           9   --

          10   A.     Yeah, as much as he can.

          11   Q.     Understood.  And subsequent to the accident and the

          12   surgery, when Marvin does come to visit you, how far do

          13   you walk or what -- what is your walking regimen now,

          14   subsequent to the accident?

          15   A.     Okay.  Now, it's been -- it's been challenged.

          16   Q.     It's been challenging?

          17   A.     Uh-huh.

          18   Q.     Do you still try to -- do you and he still try to

          19   walk after the accident?

          20   A.     Sure.  Sure.  We -- I think just the past summer,

          21   in June, he came down.

          22   Q.     You're talking about June of 2019?

          23   A.     That's correct.

          24   Q.     Go ahead.

          25   A.     We went down on Penn's Landing, where he likes to
                                                                     67



           1   go, and we watched the ships and stuff like that --

           2   Q.     Yes.

           3   A.     -- and girl watching.

           4   Q.     Understood.

           5   A.     And what had happened now, he -- he pulls out a

           6   cane, you know?  And I said, "Marvin, we got to be

           7   careful."  So once we walk down the landing where the

           8   docks is, we take a pair of steps.

           9   Q.     Yes.

          10   A.     And usually, we would walk all the way to the other

          11   end.  But we -- we approached it, and I'm walking at his

          12   pace on the -- on the crutches -- or on the cane.

          13   Q.     On the cane, right.

          14   A.     And I'm saying, "Well, take your time.  I got all

          15   day."

          16   Q.     Right.

          17   A.     You know?  And I'm just waiting for him, and we're

          18   taking our paces.  And then, we get to another pair of

          19   steps on the other end of the dock, at the -- maybe a half

          20   a mile.

          21   Q.     Yes.

          22   A.     I'd say, "We're not even gonna take these steps,"

          23   'cause I don't want to -- to see him go through the pain

          24   of trying to take steps.  And we just took the rear steps

          25   behind.  It's a half a mile away.  So he wasn't up for the
                                                                     68



           1   task anyway.

           2   Q.     Yes.  And when -- when Marvin would walk with a

           3   cane down at Penn's Landing, would he -- what hand would

           4   he hold the cane in, do you know?

           5   A.     I -- I think he would alternate.

           6   Q.     And Penn's Landing, I guess you would agree that

           7   that's at least -- what is that, like four blocks long,

           8   you think?

           9   A.     Easily.

          10   Q.     Maybe -- maybe more.

          11   A.     Even more.

          12   Q.     Yeah.  And there's -- there is a lot of steps down

          13   there.

          14   A.     Yeah, going down.

          15   Q.     Going down.

          16   A.     Going down is always easier --

          17   Q.     Understood.

          18   A.     -- in my recollection.

          19   Q.     Yeah.

          20   A.     Going up is a painful thing because it causes your

          21   body on an uphill climb.

          22   Q.     Yes.  Would you -- would you drive your vehicle to

          23   Penn's Landing, and then you and him would get out?  Or

          24   how would you get to Penn's Landing?

          25   A.     Well, we went in his car and him driving with his
                                                                     69



           1   left foot.

           2   Q.     Yes.

           3   A.     And I showed him the easy traffic to get around

           4   with.

           5   Q.     Yes.  Do you -- do you drive, Mr. Rudd?

           6   A.     Not at this time.

           7   Q.     Now, do you -- do you not -- why is that?  Do you

           8   not have a driver's license, or is there a reason why you

           9   don't drive?

          10   A.     Yeah, I don't have a driver's license.

          11   Q.     Why do you not have a driver's license?

          12   A.     For tickets.

          13   Q.     How long have you not had a driver's license, sir?

          14   A.     In the last five years, I --

          15   Q.     Five years?

          16   A.     Seven years.  I haven't drove in seven years.

          17   Q.     Seven years, all right.  And how do you get around,

          18   public transit?

          19   A.     Public transit and bike.

          20   Q.     You ride your bike?

          21   A.     Uh-huh.

          22   Q.     And what -- you -- what -- oh, okay.  Yeah.

          23   There's a lot of -- around town these days, over the last

          24   three years, I think, there's been massive construction of

          25   bike lanes.
                                                                     70



           1   A.     Uh-huh.

           2   Q.     Would you agree with that?  All from Philadelphia.

           3   A.     It's a great thing.

           4   Q.     It is.  But it can be dangerous too, don't you

           5   think?  I mean some people just disregard people on bikes.

           6   A.     Well, they -- they -- we have to catch up to:

           7   We're there.

           8   Q.     Understood.  Like for example, do you ride your

           9   bike up around the art museum?

          10   A.     Yeah.  I do it all.  Matter fact, that was half of

          11   my rehabilitation, when I -- I went out dancing, biking.

          12   And I -- I have to be able to pick up my feet --

          13   Q.     Yes.

          14   A.     -- you know, motor skill operation.

          15   Q.     So before this accident, would Marvin ride bikes

          16   with you?

          17   A.     Sure.

          18   Q.     And would you -- would you ride around

          19   Philadelphia?

          20   A.     Yeah.  Most of the time, we took the drive.

          21   Q.     Right.  You would -- when you say "drive," you're

          22   talking about the Lincoln Drive?

          23   A.     Lincoln Drive, yes.

          24   Q.     Or the -- or the Kelly Drive?

          25   A.     Yeah.
                                                                     71



           1   Q.     Along the -- along the Schuylkill River?

           2   A.     There you go.

           3   Q.     As opposed to Penn's Landing, along the Delaware

           4   River.

           5   A.     There you go.

           6   Q.     And there's -- there's a lot of -- there's bike

           7   paths all along the entire length of the Schuylkill River.

           8   A.     That's what we're talking about.

           9   Q.     And specifically for bikes, what would -- do you

          10   have a bike here for him to use, or did he bring one with

          11   him?  Did Marvin bring one with him, or did you have an

          12   extra bike for him to ride?

          13   A.     Yeah, I have an extra bike.

          14   Q.     Yeah.  And so after the accident, was Marvin able

          15   to do any bike riding with you at all?

          16   A.     No.  We canceled that altogether.

          17   Q.     That's all gone?  All right.

          18   A.     For -- on his aspect.  I still ride myself.

          19   Q.     Understood.  But when -- when -- and did Marvin

          20   enjoy going bike riding with you before the accident?

          21   A.     Sure.

          22   Q.     And now that's something he can't do?

          23   A.     That's for -- for sure.  For sure.

          24   Q.     Have you and Marvin gone -- since the accident,

          25   have you and him gone to the YMCA to work out?
                                                                     72



           1   A.     No.  That's out of the --

           2   Q.     So that's another thing that the accident has

           3   prevented Marvin from doing.  He can't work out with you,

           4   his buddy, at the YMCA, correct?

           5   A.     That's correct.

           6   Q.     Since the accident, have you and Marvin gone up to

           7   Fairmount Park, where you -- you and he used to run and --

           8   and work out at the different exercise locations?  Have

           9   you done that?

          10   A.     No.  All we do -- we go by there, and I do a scenic

          11   thing with him, glance at it, remember when and stuff like

          12   that and looking forward in the future of getting back to

          13   it some day after his recovery.

          14   Q.     Has Marvin expressed to you optimism that he may

          15   some day be able to not return to his pre-injury self, but

          16   maybe get back to working out with you in some capacity or

          17   no?

          18   A.     Well, with anybody being sick, Marvin was the same

          19   type of person.  He was saying, "One day when I'll be

          20   better."  That's how you think in the future anyway:  One

          21   day, I'll be better.  Everybody says that.

          22   Q.     Understood.

          23   A.     I'm an old man now.  I want to be a young man, but

          24   it's not gonna happen like that.

          25   Q.     No.  That -- that -- we know that's not gonna
                                                                     73



           1   happen, is it?

           2                  All right.  And you indicated that Marvin

           3   likes the doctors in Philadelphia, and he comes to see

           4   them, right?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Would you be able -- you gave us the -- the name of

           7   Dr. Mann.

           8   A.     Uh-huh.

           9   Q.     Would you be able to give us the names of any other

          10   doctors that Marvin sees in Philadelphia?  And if you

          11   can't give the name of the doctor, like just the name of

          12   the -- the practice.

          13   A.     Well, I went with him to the Rodman Institute.

          14   Q.     Yes.  Rodman -- the Rothman Institute?

          15   A.     Rothman Institute.  Sorry.

          16   Q.     That's all right.  Where else have you gone with

          17   him?

          18   A.     I had so many visits.  I also went with him at

          19   Temple Hospital.

          20   Q.     Temple Hospital?

          21   A.     Uh-huh.

          22   Q.     All right.

          23   A.     And then, Dr. Mann's practice in Philadelphia, at

          24   one of the surgical clinics.

          25   Q.     All right.  Do you have any information at all as
                                                                     74



           1   to whether Marvin ever sustained any right foot injuries

           2   before this accident, do you know?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     He -- he -- that's -- that was a bad question by

           5   me.  The -- the question is:  Do you -- has Marvin -- did

           6   Marvin ever injure his right foot before this accident?

           7   A.     His right foot?

           8   Q.     Yeah.  That's the injury that -- his right foot or

           9   toe, whatever.  Okay.  Well, that's -- that's another good

          10   distinction.  Before this accident, did Marvin ever have

          11   any injuries or conditions to his right toe --

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     -- right big toe?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     No, all right.  How about before this accident, did

          16   Marvin have any right foot injuries or conditions?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Is there any other physicians or medical providers

          19   that you want to tell us about that you have knowledge

          20   about?  Dr. Mann, Rothman Institute, Temple Hospital --

          21   did you visit all those three places with him?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Well, how would you -- would -- how would -- how

          24   would he get there?  He would come to Philadelphia, and

          25   then --
                                                                     75



           1   A.     Yeah.

           2   Q.     -- you and he would go how?

           3   A.     And I would show him how to take the safest

           4   routes --

           5   Q.     I see.

           6   A.     -- at gainful times.

           7   Q.     Would he drive?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     And you would go with him?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     And when he drove, he used his left foot?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     As far as you know, is -- is -- is Marvin a

          14   right-hand dominant person or left-hand dominant person,

          15   or do you know?

          16   A.     I would say right-hand dominant.

          17   Q.     Is it -- do you know him to be right-hand dominant,

          18   or did you just draw a conclusion?

          19   A.     I know that.

          20   Q.     Okay.  He's right-hand dominant, all right.  You

          21   indicate that -- you -- you have a statement here about

          22   halfway down page three:  "Marvin is no longer

          23   independent."

          24   A.     Oh, yeah.

          25   Q.     What do -- what do you mean by that?  What -- can
                                                                     76



           1   you give us some details in that regard.

           2   A.     Back when I was a youth, I worked in a convalescent

           3   center.  And from me seeing patients with severe

           4   injuries --

           5   Q.     Yes.

           6   A.     -- I know that -- when a person has an independent

           7   will or has a dependent will, you know?  With independent

           8   will, you can do everything that you physically are able

           9   to do at certain ages.

          10   Q.     On your own?

          11   A.     On your own.

          12   Q.     Yes.

          13   A.     Right.  Independently.  Dependent, you can't do the

          14   things within age brackets that you could have did, as a

          15   result to psychological damage or physical damage.

          16   Q.     Yes.

          17   A.     So I weighed in on it, and I could see that the --

          18   the physical damage along with the psychological damage,

          19   that he's impaired.

          20   Q.     Understood.  Would you be able to give us some

          21   specific details relative to the loss of independence

          22   sustained by Marvin in this accident?  I mean he is able

          23   to drive his car, but you've told us that he has to -- he

          24   has made accommodation to drive with his left foot?

          25   A.     That's correct.
                                                                     77



           1   Q.     What -- can you give us some other details relative

           2   to the deficit to Marvin's independence as a result of

           3   this accident?

           4   A.     Yeah.

           5   Q.     Go ahead.

           6   A.     Again, his -- his walking is impeded.

           7   Q.     Yes.  I see.  Well, we're not -- we're not gonna go

           8   through everything.  I don't want you to go through

           9   everything again --

          10   A.     Sure.

          11   Q.     -- what you've told us about, you know, the -- the

          12   workouts and the like.  Well, I -- my question was, I

          13   guess, not too good.  Marvin lives alone?

          14   A.     That's correct.

          15   Q.     Is he -- does he still live alone after the

          16   accident?

          17   A.     Yeah.

          18   Q.     So there's -- there's an element of independence

          19   there, right?

          20   A.     Not so much.  In the home, he tells me how he's got

          21   to take the shower, lean on things.  Sometimes, he drop

          22   things and he got to leave it there.  He can't be able

          23   to -- to pick it up.

          24   Q.     Yes.

          25   A.     And remember, it's a course of a year and a half,
                                                                     78



           1   I'm hearing this.  So I'm hearing all of the -- and

           2   sometimes he calls me in the middle of the night, and

           3   we're talking.  And I'll bring up an argument so he can

           4   get past the pain, you understand?

           5                  So we're arguing.  If it gets about the

           6   pain, "Hey, man, just go to sleep."  You know what I mean?

           7   You can't do nothing about that pain that you're

           8   suffering, you know?  I'm just being realistic about

           9   making him feel like a human being, you know?

          10   Q.     Do you have any psychological training at all, sir?

          11   A.     From my training in school.

          12   Q.     Right, from -- from college, you've indicated.

          13   A.     Uh-huh.

          14   Q.     I mean because you're giving some insightful

          15   comments here relative to --

          16   A.     Well, once you've been trained, you never forget

          17   your training.

          18   Q.     Yeah.  All right.  And so relative to Marvin's

          19   capabilities around his house and personal grooming, you

          20   gave us some information that he -- that he has trouble in

          21   the shower at times.

          22   A.     Very much so.

          23   Q.     What's that mean, he can't get in and out?  What's

          24   that mean?  He can't -- can he bathe himself?

          25   A.     Half of the time.  I haven't observed him in the
                                                                     79



           1   home.

           2   Q.     Understood.  But --

           3   A.     What he'll tell me over the phone:  "Bob, I'm in

           4   the tub.  I just sit here until I can get myself together,

           5   drain the water out.  I got to -- he said he's got to

           6   crawl out of the tub, whatever the case may be --

           7   Q.     Yes.

           8   A.     -- to get out of the tub and make his way back to

           9   the bed, you know, holding onto a walker, this and that.

          10   And he's made his -- his apartment conducive to his

          11   injuries.

          12   Q.     He -- he's made some accommodation to his

          13   apartment?

          14   A.     Yeah, for himself.

          15   Q.     He lives in an apartment, not a house; is that what

          16   you're telling us?

          17   A.     That's correct.

          18   Q.     Is that right?  Yeah, Apartment 8F in -- in 230

          19   Wyoming Avenue in Kingston, PA.  What are some of these

          20   accommodations that you're aware of?

          21   A.     Well, he's telling me that he's got his medication

          22   right by his bed, so he props that up.  When he makes his

          23   way to the kitchen to prepare a meal, he -- he's got to

          24   grab on things and -- you know, I guess he has a precise

          25   time that he can do more mobility in the daytime than
                                                                     80



           1   at -- at night.

           2   Q.     So what you want us to know:  When he walks around

           3   the apartment, he leans on things.  He leans on the walls?

           4   A.     Anything he can grab onto.

           5   Q.     Do you happen to know if -- if he had installed any

           6   kind of railing in his hallways or in his rooms that he

           7   can hold onto?

           8   A.     I don't know.  But he'll tell me several times,

           9   he's slipped and fell.

          10   Q.     He's slipped and fallen at home?

          11   A.     Uh-huh.

          12   Q.     Why?  Why -- what's causing the slip and fall?

          13   A.     'Cause his -- the -- he was -- to me, he was trying

          14   to get back some of his mobility.

          15   Q.     Yeah.

          16   A.     But it -- it wasn't ready yet.  He's -- he's not

          17   fully recovered, as you can imagine.

          18   Q.     Understood.  What I'm trying to find out is:  Do

          19   you have any information or knowledge relative to any

          20   physical accommodations that might have been made to

          21   Marvin's apartment as a result of this accident, a chair,

          22   railing, maybe a taller commode, you know, a chairlift

          23   that gets him up and down steps?  What do you know?

          24   A.     Well, I know one day, he was down in Philadelphia,

          25   and we picked up some old chairs that was on the trash.
                                                                     81



           1   Q.     Old chairs?

           2   A.     But they were in good shape.  He said, "Bob, I

           3   could use this in my apartment."  So had him pick it up,

           4   put it in the car.  I said, "Use it.  If it helps you, use

           5   it."

           6                  And he said -- and he told me later, "This

           7   chair works out fine 'cause I can sit up in it sometime,

           8   and I can use it as a" -- "to put things on at" -- "late

           9   at night.  So I have two ends of the bed I can work with."

          10   Q.     Do you have any knowledge as to the size and shape

          11   of Mr. -- of Marvin's apartment?  What's he got, two

          12   bedrooms?  Do you know anything about it?

          13   A.     I -- I couldn't say.  I've never been there.

          14   Q.     Understood.  I know you have never.  You've

          15   indicated that.  But maybe he -- he told you.  Or do

          16   you -- have you ever seen photos of Mr. -- of Marvin's --

          17   A.     Well, he -- he -- he told -- he told me about it.

          18   Q.     Yes.

          19   A.     And then, he sent me a picture with him in -- in

          20   the wheelchair.  This is lately, in the last month or so.

          21   In a wheelchair, he shows me him.  He said, "Bob, I'm

          22   right at the entrance to my kitchen, in my wheelchair."

          23   Q.     So what you want us so know is Marvin has a

          24   wheelchair that he uses in his apartment?

          25   A.     Yeah.
                                                                     82



           1   Q.     When -- when Marvin comes to you house -- your

           2   house, do you have a wheelchair for him to use?

           3   A.     No.  He doesn't have it.  He just got the

           4   wheelchair.

           5   Q.     Understood.  Do you know when he -- when did he

           6   first obtain the wheelchair?  What's your knowledge of

           7   that?

           8   A.     Just about -- about three weeks ago.

           9   Q.     Three weeks ago, all right.  And the next time that

          10   Marvin comes to your house, are you gonna have a

          11   wheelchair available for him?  Do you plan on doing that?

          12   A.     I don't think so.

          13   Q.     No?

          14   A.     He better bring it with him.

          15   Q.     Okay.  He's got to bring it with him?

          16   A.     Yeah.

          17   Q.     Do you know how -- and I know it's only been three

          18   weeks.  Do you know how often Marvin uses the wheelchair?

          19   A.     Oh, he -- he -- right now, in the day, he's

          20   bedridden.

          21   Q.     Right now?  And -- and today is August 14th --

          22   A.     That's correct.

          23   Q.     -- 2019.

          24   A.     I just talked to him last night.  He said, "Bob, I

          25   can't even get out of bed."  And he's got a nurse twice a
                                                                     83



           1   day.

           2   Q.     A nurse comes to the apartment twice a day?  Why

           3   does that nurse come to his apartment?

           4   A.     'Cause he's having trouble with his back and foot.

           5   And everything else that he could do physically, he can't

           6   do anymore.

           7   Q.     And you spoke to -- today -- you spoke to Marvin on

           8   the 13th of August?  That's yesterday.

           9   A.     That's correct.

          10   Q.     And he told you that he can't get out of bed?

          11   A.     Nope.

          12   Q.     And a nurse comes to the apartment two times a

          13   week?

          14   A.     Two times a day.

          15   Q.     Two times a day.  And what is your knowledge of the

          16   reason that nurse comes?  Is that for his back or for his

          17   foot or both?

          18   A.     Both.  His health has taken a turn for the worse.

          19   I was just telling him --

          20   Q.     You think he's taken a turn for the worse?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     When -- when did that -- did you -- you just drew

          23   that conclusion as of last night or --

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     When -- when do you think he started to take a turn
                                                                     84



           1   for the worse?

           2   A.     In -- maybe in the last six months.

           3   Q.     Last six months.

           4   A.     And I think it's been gradually that his -- his

           5   health is deteriorating.

           6   Q.     His health is deteriorating?

           7   A.     Uh-huh.

           8   Q.     Do you happen to -- has -- does Marvin suffer from

           9   any kind of diseases or conditions like diabetes?

          10   A.     No, he doesn't.

          11   Q.     Do you know if has -- he has any heart conditions?

          12   A.     No.

          13   Q.     No?  No heart conditions?

          14   A.     He's got back pain.

          15   Q.     Understood.  And is it your understanding the back

          16   pain is from this accident?

          17   A.     I -- I can't make that decision.

          18   Q.     You don't know?

          19   A.     But I know he's been injured.  I know he's never

          20   complained about it before until after the accident.

          21   Q.     Understood.  You -- but you -- we do know that

          22   his -- his right foot -- right toe injury is from this

          23   accident.

          24   A.     That's correct.

          25   Q.     Right.  And I -- I know you're able to definitively
                                                                     85



           1   say that.  Are you able to definitively say that Marvin's

           2   back pain is also related to the 2/27/18 accident, or you

           3   just don't know?

           4   A.     Well, judging what I've seen and judging from the

           5   complaints that he tells me about -- and I've seen his

           6   back physically.

           7   Q.     Yes.

           8   A.     And I've seen the weight loss.  I've seen his --

           9   his skeleton.  As far as his vertebrae, it's been -- it's

          10   bulging out of the -- of -- of his back.  And I've -- I've

          11   actually myself put the pain patches on his back myself.

          12   I've did that several times.

          13   Q.     What -- at your house?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     How much do you think -- go ahead.  You were gonna

          16   say something.

          17   A.     For -- for the purpose of I'm taking care of him.

          18   Q.     Right.

          19   A.     And like I was telling Mr. O'Donnell that

          20   painstakingly, I've been -- I'm kind of going through it.

          21   And it's now just starting to convalesce me.  Because I

          22   can't do the steps that he does.  You know, I can't walk

          23   along and -- and take care of a sick person.  That'll make

          24   me sick, you know?

          25                  I'm fighting for my health as well.  You
                                                                     86



           1   know, I have an enlarged heart, so I have to do robust

           2   things, do athletic things, walk, jog to keep my heart in

           3   pace.  And so now, working with a friend that been

           4   impaired physically, I can't no longer do it, because it's

           5   impeding on my health.

           6   Q.     Did you ever have any intention of moving up to

           7   Marvin's house for a while and staying with him to help

           8   him or no?

           9   A.     I thought about it.

          10   Q.     Right.  But that's all?  That's -- you have -- you

          11   don't have any plans to do that, do you?

          12   A.     Well, we planned for him getting better.  And then,

          13   we're -- we're -- our friendship in the athletic aspect

          14   and caring for each other would also extend from that

          15   point.

          16   Q.     Right.

          17   A.     And I'm hopeful that he would get well also.

          18   Q.     You're hopeful that he'll get better?

          19   A.     I'm hoping so.

          20   Q.     Do you know how old he is?

          21   A.     64 years old.

          22   Q.     He's 64?

          23   A.     Uh-huh.

          24   Q.     All right.  You have some information that when

          25   Marvin drives a vehicle, he has -- he uses his left foot
                                                                     87



           1   and cruise control due to his right foot injury, right?

           2   A.     Uh-huh.

           3                  MR. O'DONNELL:  Was that a "yes"?  You have

           4   to say "yes."

           5                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           6                  MR. O'DONNELL:  Thank you.

           7   BY MR. CRANE:

           8   Q.     And you -- you know that because you've -- you've

           9   actually been in -- in a car with Marvin when he drove

          10   that way.  And of course, he tells you that too; is that

          11   correct?

          12   A.     Uh-huh.

          13   Q.     All right.  And what you -- you also want us to

          14   know is Marvin has made some driving accommodations in

          15   that he tries not to drive during busy rush hour or heavy

          16   traffic.  Why is that?

          17   A.     Well, because traffic causes a problem to him as a

          18   left foot driver not used to using left foot.  So you have

          19   to have a mind-set that:  I'm driving unorthodox.

          20   Q.     Yes.

          21   A.     So at the same time, it's better for a person to be

          22   careful as they can, and low rate of traffic would

          23   actually benefit.

          24   Q.     Right.  And so Marvin knows that he has a deficit

          25   driving a car, and to try to help that deficit, he drives
                                                                     88



           1   at -- at hours where the traffic is lighter, such as at

           2   1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m., he leaves your house.  That's what

           3   you're telling us, right?

           4   A.     That's correct.

           5   Q.     All right.  And prior to the accident -- prior to

           6   the accident that brings us here today, did Marvin have

           7   any problems in driving in heavy traffic?

           8   A.     Prior to the accident?

           9   Q.     Yeah, prior to --

          10   A.     No.  No, he didn't.

          11   Q.     Prior to the 2/27/18 accident, Marvin had no

          12   problems driving in heavy traffic conditions.  That's what

          13   you want us to know, right?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     You've indicated -- and I think you've already

          16   alluded to this -- "Marvin thought" -- I'm now at the top

          17   of page four:

          18                  "Marvin thought that he would have a

          19   complete recovery.  Unfortunately, this is not the case to

          20   this day.  Frequently, I would see Marvin fighting through

          21   pain and frustration.  It was difficult for Marvin to

          22   accept his new limitations, because he was so active

          23   before the accident but no longer is.

          24                  After the accident and surgery, Marvin has

          25   limited physical activity.  He no longer goes to the
                                                                     89



           1   park," like you were telling us.  "Marvin doesn't eat

           2   because of his depression."  What do you know about that?

           3   A.     Okay.  Like I alluded to at first, that he was

           4   crazy about the steak sandwiches in Philadelphia --

           5   Q.     Yes.

           6   A.     -- and the hoagies and things like that.

           7   Q.     Right.

           8   A.     And I seen prior to that, maybe a year back, we

           9   could sit down and he would eat a whole hoagie.  But now,

          10   gradually, he would only eat half of it, you know?  And I

          11   noticed eating half is what he could, you know?

          12   Q.     What -- was Marvin raised in Philadelphia?  Did he

          13   grow up in Philadelphia, do you know?

          14   A.     No, he didn't.

          15   Q.     Do you know where he grew up?

          16   A.     He grew up in Virginia and later moved down here.

          17   He had a --

          18   Q.     When you say "down here," where's down here?

          19   A.     Well, in Kingston.

          20   Q.     Right.  Okay.  Well, that's -- that's closer than

          21   Virginia.

          22   A.     Sure.  Sure.

          23   Q.     But I mean I think that Kingston might be 120 miles

          24   from here.

          25   A.     Yeah.
                                                                     90



           1   Q.     From Philadelphia.

           2   A.     Sure.

           3   Q.     This -- this is King of Prussia.

           4   A.     I understand.  And he said he lived in Baltimore at

           5   one time.

           6   Q.     Okay.  I mean I understand when -- when you're

           7   talking about Marvin's liking for hoagies and -- and

           8   steak -- cheese steaks and stuff.  I mean I've -- I went

           9   to school in Ohio and people would talk about it, you

          10   know?

          11   A.     That's right.

          12   Q.     And it's not the same.  You can't --

          13   A.     No.

          14   Q.     A cheese steak in Columbus, Ohio is not -- is not a

          15   cheese steak -- a Jim cheese steak in Philly.

          16   A.     You already know it.

          17   Q.     Not even close.

          18   A.     Not even close.

          19   Q.     And they don't even call them hoagies.  They call

          20   them subs or some ridiculous --

          21   A.     Subs, yeah.  There you go.

          22   Q.     They look at you like:  What's a hoagie?

          23   A.     I know that's right.

          24   Q.     And I -- I don't know though.  Kingston, they

          25   probably know what hoagies and cheese steaks are, right?
                                                                     91



           1   That's not that far from here.

           2   A.     No.  But you still want the taste of that

           3   Philadelphia --

           4   Q.     Yeah.  That's true.  It's all about the roll,

           5   right?

           6   A.     Yeah, it's all about the rolls.

           7   Q.     Yeah.  But I mean I've -- I've been up to Kingston

           8   and Wilkes-Barre many times.  There's -- there's a decent

           9   Philadelphia connection there.  People go -- from there

          10   come down here.  They go to school -- Temple, Saint

          11   Joseph, South Penn, Drexel, Villanova, you know?

          12   A.     All you hear about the steak sandwich.

          13   Q.     Yeah.

          14   A.     And he was -- like he would always say, "Bob,

          15   where's South Street at?  I heard they got some good steak

          16   sandwich."

          17                  "Let me take you to South Street."

          18   Q.     Yeah.

          19   A.     That's what it was about.

          20   Q.     All right.  Now, you -- we're on page -- I'm on

          21   page four.  "Shopping, for Marvin, is a huge struggle."

          22   Can you -- what does that mean?

          23   A.     Well, I had to first get him to understand his

          24   limitation.  Now, we would be walking in the market, and

          25   you can walk a quarter mile around the market, you know?
                                                                     92



           1   up and down the aisle.

           2   Q.     Yeah.

           3   A.     So I would suggest to him, "Get a motor chair.

           4   That way, we could save some time.  And plus, you wont

           5   be -- you know, it won't be that much pain to you.'.

           6                  Cause we had a routine.  As we go through

           7   the day, get him some food and stuff like that, go to the

           8   supermarket or -- or a steak shop.  And then, I'd go home,

           9   let him get a little respite, maybe give him aid as far as

          10   getting him an ice pack for his foot --

          11   Q.     Yes.

          12   A.     -- prop him up in the chair, elevate his feet, put

          13   a pillow behind his back, do all these things before he

          14   would set out on his night task to go back home.  So it

          15   was a routine that we had.

          16   Q.     Understood.  And so you have information or

          17   knowledge:  When you would -- you would take him shopping

          18   when he would come here, he would actually use one of

          19   those mechanized carts?

          20   A.     That's correct.

          21   Q.     All right.  And how did that make him feel, do you

          22   know?

          23   A.     Psychologically, he -- he couldn't come to grips

          24   with it.  Because he's saying, "This is not my life.

          25   I'm -- I can't fill it."
                                                                     93



           1                  I said, But in the process of getting well,

           2   this is a part of it.  'Cause you can't get well using

           3   the -- the things that you're using.  The cane won't do

           4   it.  That will 'cause more agitation to the physical

           5   limitation, you know?

           6                  I said, "A lot of people use chairs."  I

           7   had to -- I had to tell him I had to use a cane for maybe

           8   a year in my life, off -- off and on.  But I would do it

           9   when I felt my anatomy weakening.  That's the third leg.

          10   Q.     Right.

          11   A.     You know?  And it becomes your friend after a

          12   while.

          13   Q.     You indicate here that Marvin never goes out.  I

          14   mean when -- when he comes and visits you, that's going

          15   out.  But when you say, "Marvin never goes out," what does

          16   that mean?

          17   A.     Okay.  When he's at home.

          18   Q.     At his home in Kingston?

          19   A.     Sure.  He -- he tells me on several occasions --

          20   Q.     Yes.

          21   A.     -- "Bob, I ain't been nowhere.  I've just been

          22   stuck in the house all the time."  'Cause he calls me any

          23   time that he feels like it during the day.  I may not have

          24   time to talk with him.  And I, way late -- and I said,

          25   "Well, call me late tonight.  Your time, any time, just
                                                                     94



           1   call me."

           2   Q.     Right.

           3   A.     And he would do that.

           4   Q.     When -- when Marvin is in his apartment, what's he

           5   doing?  Does he use a computer?  Is he watching TV?  Is he

           6   reading?  Do you know?

           7   A.     He's talking about pain all the time.  All -- from

           8   the beginning of our conversation to the end, he's talking

           9   about his pain and his limitations.

          10   Q.     Yeah.

          11   A.     That -- that -- that's the truss of the

          12   conversation.

          13   Q.     All right.  What I'm asking you now though is:  Do

          14   you have any knowledge or information as to what Marvin

          15   does in his apartment?  You said, "He's not going out.

          16   He's stuck in there."  Does -- for example, does he use a

          17   computer?

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     No?

          20   A.     Uh-uh.  He -- most of the time, he -- "Bob, I'm

          21   laying up here.  I got my foot elevated.  You want me to

          22   show you the picture?"  I couldn't believe it.  I don't --

          23   you know, I -- I know what you do what -- when you're

          24   here, you know?

          25   Q.     Yes.
                                                                     95



           1   A.     So I changed the conversation.

           2   Q.     Is he watching TV?  What's he doing, do you know?

           3   As far as you know.

           4   A.     Of course, he's watching TV sometimes.

           5   Q.     Yeah.

           6   A.     But again, I'd like the say that the pain,

           7   psychologically and depression-wise, he can't get around

           8   it, just being --

           9   Q.     Do you know if he has friends or relatives up in

          10   where -- near where he lives?  Do you know about that?

          11   A.     Well, he's got a girlfriend up there, and he

          12   alleviates that he -- he -- they're broken off, and she

          13   doesn't come to see him as used to.  Their relationship

          14   has went downhill.

          15   Q.     Why -- and why did that relationship go downhill?

          16   A.     Well --

          17   Q.     Because of this accident?

          18   A.     Because of the accident, yes.

          19   Q.     All right.  And you were -- I interrupted you

          20   because I wanted to hear you say that first.  Now, you

          21   were gonna give us some details.  How did -- how did --

          22   what -- what became of this relationship due to this

          23   accident?

          24   A.     Well, as friends, we would talk about male and

          25   female relationships.
                                                                     96



           1   Q.     Yes.

           2   A.     So he said, "Bob, we" -- "we don't have the fun

           3   that we used to have.  She hasn't came to see me in a" --

           4   "in a coon's age," if you can understand that.

           5   Q.     Yes.

           6   A.     And I would try to give him the understanding that

           7   people really can't care for sick people.  She cares about

           8   you --

           9   Q.     Yes.

          10   A.     -- but the limitations that you have, you have to

          11   have a person that deal with sickness.  Not everybody can

          12   deal with sickness.

          13                  And he had told me that she was a woman

          14   that lost her son and lost her -- her husband.  This was

          15   maybe a year ago.  So I'm trying to build confidence in

          16   him and tell him that she's not prepared to deal with

          17   another sickness right now.  And this has just been three

          18   or four years down the road.

          19   Q.     Understood.  You indicate that Marvin no longer

          20   works.  At the time of this accident, was Marvin employed?

          21   A.     Yes, he was.

          22   Q.     Who was he employed by, do you know?

          23   A.     He worked at a -- I believe that he worked at a

          24   geriatrics home or center.

          25   Q.     Doing what?  What did he do there?
                                                                     97



           1   A.     He worked in food service.

           2   Q.     All right.  Was he a full-time worker?

           3   A.     I think he had a part-time position.

           4   Q.     Did he have any other jobs?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Does -- did Marvin have any military experience?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     And then, I guess that job at the -- at the

           9   geriatric center, he had to do that on his feet?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     All right.  Did, as far as you know, Marvin ever

          12   return to work after this accident?

          13   A.     No, he hasn't returned.

          14   Q.     No.  And why doesn't he work, as far as you know?

          15   A.     The physical -- the physical limitations and

          16   psychological.

          17   Q.     Right.

          18   A.     He's not prepared to.

          19   Q.     From this accident?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     Do you know if -- if Marvin has attempted to find

          22   employment elsewhere where maybe he doesn't have to stand

          23   up or it's so physical?

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     He -- he has not tried to find employment?
                                                                     98



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     No, okay.  I'm almost finished with my questioning.

           3   The other attorneys might have a few questions for you,

           4   Mr. Rudd.

           5                  Well, you indicate that he did enjoy his

           6   part-time job.  That was another part of the -- life's

           7   enjoyment for Marvin.  He liked to go to work.  Why is

           8   that, 'cause he liked to interact with the people?

           9   A.     Yeah.

          10   Q.     Was that part of a social outlet for him?

          11   A.     It was a social outlet.

          12   Q.     Yeah.  Do you know if Marvin is a member at a

          13   church?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     He is?

          16   A.     Yes, he is.

          17   Q.     And has this accident interfered with his

          18   churchgoing efforts, if you know?

          19   A.     Yes, it has.

          20   Q.     Do you know the name of the church that he was a

          21   member at or --

          22   A.     No, I don't.

          23   Q.     Does he -- do you know if Marvin still goes -- goes

          24   to church at all or he's reduced to -- what do you -- what

          25   can you tell us in --
                                                                     99



           1   A.     I think it's reduced.  I think he calls some of the

           2   members that he had a good relationship with.  Also, his

           3   pastor, he calls him and talks to him --

           4   Q.     Yes.

           5   A.     -- and the more people that was familiar with him

           6   and familiar with his being in an accident and his

           7   wellbeing.

           8   Q.     Yes.

           9   A.     And so they miss him, of course.  And he missed

          10   doing the evangelistic work he used to do.

          11   Q.     Yeah.  What -- what was that work?  What did he do?

          12   You said he did evangelistic work, so you're saying that

          13   he would maybe knock on doors or --

          14   A.     Well --

          15   Q.     -- go to a location -- I'm sorry.  What --

          16   A.     Well, he would -- he was active with the church, so

          17   whatever his church did --

          18   Q.     Yes.

          19   A.     -- and they did, he did likewise and attended bible

          20   studies and things like that.

          21   Q.     Yes.  And -- and it's your understanding that --

          22   that Marvin no longer attends bible studies or engages in

          23   evangelical endeavors because of this accident?  Is that

          24   --

          25   A.     That is correct.
                                                                    100



           1   Q.     All right.  Do you know if any of the church

           2   members come to visit him at his apartment?

           3   A.     I think that he talks to most of them on the phone.

           4   Q.     Right.

           5   A.     And I think I recall the -- maybe five times that

           6   he said that he -- this was before the accident --

           7   Q.     Yes.

           8   A.     -- and I think maybe one other time after the

           9   accident -- that he went and seen the pastor of the

          10   church.

          11   Q.     Right.

          12   A.     I think that -- and the pastor gave him, more or

          13   less, a spiritual insight to help with his wellbeing --

          14   Q.     Understood.

          15   A.     Yeah.  Things like that.

          16   Q.     Understood.  Do you know if any people visit Marvin

          17   at his apartment?

          18   A.     No.  I think mostly phone calls.

          19   Q.     Phone calls.  Are his mother and father still alive

          20   or --

          21   A.     His mother is.

          22   Q.     Where?  Does she live in Virginia?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     Does she ever go up and visit him, do you know?

          25   A.     They just finished visiting just last week.
                                                                    101



           1   Q.     Who's "they"?

           2   A.     His sister and his niece came here last -- he had

           3   a -- a postate operation just last week.

           4   Q.     Who had the operation?

           5   A.     Marvin.

           6   Q.     And what kind of operation was that?

           7   A.     A postate.

           8   Q.     Oh, a prostate --

           9   A.     Prostate.

          10   Q.     Yeah, prostate.  Yeah.

          11   A.     Uh-huh.

          12   Q.     Does he have -- does he have prostate cancer?

          13   A.     I don't think he's been diagnosed with cancer.

          14   Q.     He just had prostate operation.  And that -- when

          15   was that?

          16   A.     Just -- just last week.

          17   Q.     You're talking about the -- like in August of 2019?

          18   A.     Uh-huh.

          19   Q.     Where was that done?  Was that in Philly or was

          20   that up in Kingston?

          21   A.     Philadelphia.

          22   Q.     You know what hospital?

          23   A.     Yeah, University of Pennsylvania.

          24   Q.     Yeah.

          25   A.     Did I say "University of Pennsylvania"?
                                                                    102



           1   Q.     You did.

           2   A.     Presbyterian.

           3   Q.     Presbyterian, okay.  And where would his mother and

           4   sister -- did they -- did they get a hotel room, or did

           5   you put them up in your place?

           6   A.     No.  They got a hotel room.

           7   Q.     Yeah.  Did you go to visit Marvin in the hospital?

           8   A.     No, I didn't.

           9   Q.     Do you know the nature of Marvin's prostate

          10   problem?

          11   A.     I don't know the nature, but I know he had a

          12   prostate problem.

          13   Q.     That's -- I understand.  I mean that's why I asked

          14   you maybe if you -- if you had any knowledge of whether he

          15   was diagnosed with cancer.

          16   A.     No, he hasn't been diagnosed with cancer at all.

          17   Q.     Was Marvin -- has he been released from the

          18   hospital, or is he still in Philadelphia?

          19   A.     No, he's been released.

          20   Q.     How did he get home?  Did you -- did someone drive

          21   him to --

          22   A.     His sister drove him.

          23   Q.     His sister and mother drove him back to Kingston?

          24   A.     That's correct.

          25   Q.     Do you know of any other surgical procedure that
                                                                    103



           1   Marvin may -- may have had in his life other than his

           2   right foot and his prostate?

           3   A.     That I know of?

           4   Q.     Yeah, that you know of.  We only -- we only want --

           5   can only ask you what you know of from whatever source,

           6   okay?  You have no information regarding any of the other

           7   surgeries that Marvin may have had?

           8   A.     Surgeries, no, I don't.

           9   Q.     You told us that -- in the statement that Marvin

          10   had a long relationship with a woman prior to the

          11   accident.  Is that the woman that you were already telling

          12   us about?

          13   A.     That's correct.

          14   Q.     And you indicate in the statement that Marvin felt

          15   like this woman friend looked at him as a cripple.

          16   A.     Yeah.

          17   Q.     Did he tell you that?

          18   A.     Yeah.  Again, in the statement, he tells me about a

          19   time that they were walking together.

          20   Q.     Yes.

          21   A.     And she's taking the lead, and she's kind of

          22   shameful of his impairment.  So she's looking back on him,

          23   hoping that he can adjust himself.  But I know she

          24   blatantly calls him a cripple, and so I know that kind of

          25   depressed him.
                                                                    104



           1   Q.     She called him a cripple?

           2   A.     Yeah.

           3   Q.     And Marvin told you that?

           4   A.     Yeah.  "You a cripple."

           5   Q.     Did you ever meet this woman?

           6   A.     No, I never met her.

           7   Q.     And you indicate in the statement, "Marvin believes

           8   he has lost some sexual powers as a result of this" -- "of

           9   the accident," right?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Did he tell you that?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     And he -- Marvin also fears that he might not be

          14   able to find another woman because of physical limitations

          15   due to this accident?

          16   A.     That's correct.

          17   Q.     He told you that?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     All right.  And then, you -- we're almost finished

          20   here with this statement.  You just alluded to the

          21   situation where the woman friend was -- wouldn't walk

          22   beside him, but walked in front of him, shameful 'cause

          23   she was ashamed of being seen with him, I guess.  That's

          24   what you want us to know?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                    105



           1   Q.     And Mr. -- and Marvin could feel -- feel that

           2   shame; is that it?

           3   A.     Sure.  Sure.

           4   Q.     Just a few more questions, Mr. Rudd.

           5                  THE WITNESS:  I got to go to the bathroom

           6   again.

           7                  MR. CRANE:  All right.

           8                  (Recess taken from 11:57 a.m. to 12:01

           9   p.m.)

          10   BY MR. CRANE:

          11   Q.     Just a few more questions unrelated to the --

          12   the -- your statement, Mr. Rudd.  What is your knowledge

          13   or information regarding the facts of the accident that

          14   brings us here today?  What do you know about that

          15   accident?  I mean I know you didn't witness it, but, you

          16   know, maybe Marvin told you some things or maybe you saw

          17   the police report.  I don't know.

          18   A.     Well, from what he told me, he was in the

          19   right-hand lane on the -- a fast moving lane.  And --

          20   Q.     Yes.

          21   A.     -- a guy crossed the median strip, making an

          22   illegal left turn, and collided into his car.

          23   Q.     And do you have any information or knowledge that

          24   Marvin had immediate pain in his foot?  Did he tell you

          25   that?
                                                                    106



           1   A.     Yeah.

           2   Q.     What did he tell you?

           3   A.     Well, the time that he told me about the accident

           4   through a phone call --

           5   Q.     Yes.

           6   A.      -- he said, "Bob, I've broken my toe due to the

           7   accident."  And he don't know what else -- he said, "I

           8   don't know what else is" -- "but right now, they have

           9   x-rayed it and found out I got a broken toe."

          10   Q.     Now, you gave us some information relative to the

          11   medical treatment that Mr. -- that Marvin had relative to

          12   this accident.  You -- you've taken -- you took him to a

          13   couple of visits?

          14   A.     Oh, yeah.  I was with him every time he came down

          15   to Philadelphia except for one time when he went for the

          16   actual surgery.  That's the only time.  Maybe -- maybe one

          17   other time, I wasn't with him.  But everything then, that

          18   time -- it's been like a year -- year and eight -- eight

          19   months, I've been with him.

          20   Q.     And other than -- other than the idea that Mr. --

          21   that Marvin did break a toe, have you -- do you have any

          22   knowledge or information regarding the specific type of

          23   injury that Mr. -- that Marvin sustained in this accident?

          24   I mean we know he broke his toe, but there's some, you

          25   know, medical jargon relative to that.  Do you have any
                                                                    107



           1   information in that regard?

           2   A.     Well, I know that his -- his back is causing him a

           3   lot of problems.

           4   Q.     His back.  Has he had any back surgery from this

           5   accident?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     No?

           8   A.     Not of yet.

           9   Q.     Has any surgery been recommended to him, as far as

          10   you know, for his back?

          11   A.     Yes, it's been recommended by a doctor.

          12   Q.     Do you know who did that?

          13   A.     Well, I don't know the particular doctor's name.

          14   But the last told from him, told to me --

          15   Q.     Yes.

          16   A.     -- that the doctor has said that the last vertebrae

          17   in his back is in the shape of a V.  And he says that that

          18   bone has been shifted out, and the bone that sits down

          19   into that V-like shape has been fractured.

          20   Q.     And so what you're telling us is Marvin has told

          21   you that a physician has told him that he should have back

          22   surgery.  Correct statement?

          23   A.     Yes.  And he told him if he doesn't have it -- back

          24   surgery --

          25   Q.     If he does not have the back surgery --
                                                                    108



           1   A.     -- he will be paralyzed.

           2   Q.     He will be paralyzed --

           3   A.     Yeah.

           4   Q.     -- eventually?

           5   A.     Uh-huh.

           6   Q.     So --

           7   A.     And if he does have it, he'd only give him a 50/50

           8   chance that he won't be paralyzed from the waist down.

           9   Q.     When did you hear -- when did Marvin tell you that?

          10   A.     He's been telling me that for -- now --

          11   Q.     Oh, I see.

          12   A.     -- for about a month and a half.

          13   Q.     Month and a half?

          14   A.     Uh-huh.

          15   Q.     So has Marvin told you or given you any information

          16   that he's trying to schedule this surgery or no?

          17   A.     He's still in the aspect of getting a second

          18   opinion.

          19   Q.     Second opinion.  And do you know the names of any

          20   of the doctors that treated him relative to his back?

          21   A.     No.  He -- he gave me names, but if I didn't write

          22   it down, I couldn't --

          23   Q.     Understood.  And -- and, you know, there's medical

          24   records, you know?

          25   A.     Sure.
                                                                    109



           1   Q.     And you're not -- we know that you're not a doctor.

           2   Once again, this purpose here is just to inquire any

           3   knowledge that you might have.  And if you don't know, you

           4   don't know.

           5   A.     Yeah.

           6   Q.     Yeah.  All right.

           7   A.     And I've seen his back.  I've seen that, from my

           8   observation --

           9   Q.     Yes.

          10   A.     -- that he has something bulging out of his back.

          11   I know it's not right.

          12   Q.     Something bulging out of his lower back?

          13   A.     Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I see it, and he points to the --

          14   and like I said before, I put on the pain medication

          15   packs -- patches.

          16   Q.     Yes.

          17   A.     And I can see it, you know?  And I get -- he would

          18   take his hand and point to it.  "Bob, this is where the

          19   pain at.  I want you to put the" -- "the patch right on

          20   there."

          21   Q.     All right.  Are -- are you aware that, in the

          22   surgery that -- that Marvin had to his toe, he -- like --

          23   like we talked about, it was called "a hemiarthroplasty of

          24   the right first MPJ with implant"?  That's -- that's the

          25   surgery he had.
                                                                    110



           1   A.     Uh-huh.

           2   Q.     There -- there was a piece of hardware, titanium,

           3   as you indicated, put into his foot.  Are you aware of

           4   that?

           5   A.     Yes.  And he -- he -- he sent me a picture over the

           6   phone.

           7   Q.     Yeah.  And he has a scar on his foot, right?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Could you describe the scar?  What's it look like?

          10   A.     Well, it's a scar going down the center of his big

          11   toe, up past the -- where, I'd say, the joint.

          12   Q.     Yes.

          13   A.     I would say it's maybe a four-inch scar.

          14   Q.     Four-inch, all right.  Just a few more questions,

          15   sir.  Have you actually ever reviewed any of the medical

          16   records?  I mean there -- there's no obligation for you to

          17   do that.

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     No?  All right.  And you -- you gave us some

          20   information that you -- at one time, you were present when

          21   Dr. Mann spoke with Mr. -- with Marvin.  Did you -- did

          22   you, yourself, speak with Dr. Mann too or no?  Did you

          23   just listen?

          24   A.     I just listened.

          25   Q.     And so have -- have you ever spoken to any of his
                                                                    111



           1   doctors, you, yourself?

           2   A.     No.  I was just observing.

           3   Q.     I -- I wouldn't really be -- I don't know if it

           4   would be appropriate or not.  I mean you -- you guys are

           5   buddies.  It's just an area of inquiry, just a "T" you

           6   cross, an "I" to dot, you know?  Maybe you -- at some

           7   point, maybe you had spoken to a doctor, and we would want

           8   to find that out.  But I wouldn't really expect that you

           9   would speak to his doctors, but I have to inquire about

          10   that.  You know what I'm saying?

          11   A.     I understand.

          12   Q.     Yeah.  Okay.  When -- when you -- you've looked at

          13   Mr. -- you've looked at Marvin's right foot, and you told

          14   us you've seen the scar.  Have -- have you -- is it

          15   malformed in any other way?  What do you see when you look

          16   at his right foot?

          17   A.     Yeah.  It's a -- it's a little bit malformed, from

          18   my observation.

          19   Q.     Understood.  Like, for example, is his -- his right

          20   toe crooked in any manner?

          21   A.     Yeah.  It -- it veers off to the right, you know?

          22   As paired to the other foot, it's straight.

          23   Q.     Yes.

          24   A.     So, you know, due to the surgery and the stitches

          25   and --
                                                                    112



           1   Q.     Understood.

           2   A.     -- the titanium screw, it -- it kind of --

           3   Q.     Yes.

           4   A.     -- veers off just a -- a --

           5   Q.     Understood.

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Has -- does -- does Marvin wear any specific or --

           8   specific shoes as a result of this accident?  Has he had

           9   to wear orthotic shoes or change his shoe-wearing habits?

          10   A.     He -- he has a lot of shoes that he's changed.

          11   He's got some comfortable shoes --

          12   Q.     Yes.

          13   A.     -- with soft, sponge-like -- maybe a Skechers-type

          14   of shoe, sneaker.

          15   Q.     Yes.

          16   A.     So it's like that.  And even at times, he's got to

          17   take that off, you know, give his foot a little bit

          18   more of a -- a respite.

          19   Q.     Yes.

          20                  MR. CRANE:  All right.  Sir, I'm sorry for

          21   such exhausting questions.  That's all I have.  Neil might

          22   have some questions or Mr. Sheridan.

          23                  Who's next?

          24                  MR. SHERIDAN:  I do.  Neil, you want me to

          25   go first?
                                                                    113



           1                  MR. O'DONNELL:  Yeah, please.

           2   BY MR. SHERIDAN:

           3   Q.     Mr. Rudd, can you hear me?

           4   A.     Yes, I can, sir.

           5   Q.     All right.  Very good.  So I'm the attorney for a

           6   fellow by the last name Agami, and he was the driver of

           7   the other car, all right?

           8   A.     Understood.

           9   Q.     And I'm calling you from Scranton.  Just so you

          10   know, that's where I am.

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     So let me just back up a little bit.  What year did

          13   you first meet Mr. Bassett?

          14   A.     Year, per se -- but I would say approximately about

          15   14 years ago.

          16   Q.     All right.  And so for 14 years, has he been coming

          17   down to Philadelphia to visit you?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     And has he done that pretty consistently over that

          20   full period of time?

          21   A.     Yes, especially after the death of his older

          22   brother, Marvin.

          23   Q.     His older brother --

          24                  MR. O'DONNELL:  You mean Omar, right?

          25                  THE WITNESS:  Omar.  I'm -- correction:
                                                                    114



           1   Omar.

           2   BY MR. SHERIDAN:

           3   Q.     Okay.  And when did that happen?

           4   A.     The death of his brother?

           5   Q.     Yeah, roughly.

           6   A.     I would think that -- we were last talking about

           7   it, and we -- we were saying that it's been more than five

           8   years.  I think it was back in 2013, as I can recall.

           9   Q.     All right.  So from that point forward, he --

          10   Mr. Bassett would come down and see you more often?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     And if I understand correctly, you think that he

          13   came down about once every three or -- three or four

          14   months?

          15   A.     Yes, definitely so.

          16   Q.     And he would always come down just for one day?

          17   A.     Most of -- most of the time, yes.  It was no more

          18   than that.

          19   Q.     Did he ever -- yeah.  Did he ever spend the night

          20   with you?

          21   A.     No, sir.

          22   Q.     And what time would he normally get there?

          23   A.     Most of the time, it was morning time.  I would say

          24   that -- 10:00 or shortly thereafter.

          25   Q.     All right.  And you're home all day yourself?
                                                                    115



           1   A.     No.  We -- we --

           2   Q.     I mean back then, were you working when he would

           3   come down and --

           4   A.     We would make appointments.  We would make

           5   appointment.  And he knew places where I would go, and he

           6   would inquire about me through friends and everything like

           7   that.  So if -- if he was to -- he would return upon me,

           8   getting the information from my friends and -- and him, if

           9   he didn't reach me by phone.

          10   Q.     But when he would come down to see you, you know,

          11   after 2013, 2014, were you always living at the same

          12   address?

          13   A.     No.  No, I wasn't.  I was living at 4145 --

          14   Q.     That's okay.  I don't need the -- I don't need the

          15   address.  That's okay.

          16   A.     Yeah.  No.

          17   Q.     I'm just trying to get a sense of -- but so anyway,

          18   he would come down in the morning sometime and stay all

          19   day and then leave late that night or early the next

          20   morning; is that correct?

          21   A.     Never in the early the next -- late morning, yes.

          22   We're talking about maybe 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock in the

          23   morning.

          24   Q.     All right.  And is it your testimony that in --

          25   even after 2013 and 2014, the two of you would actually
                                                                    116



           1   jog together or run together?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And so are you still a runner yourself?

           4   A.     Yes, I am.

           5   Q.     All right.  And how often do you run?

           6   A.     I would say, in the last six months, at least

           7   once -- once a week.

           8   Q.     All right.  And are -- are you saying also that you

           9   and Mr. Bassett used to ride bikes together or no?

          10   A.     That's correct.

          11   Q.     So you have a bike there at your place?

          12   A.     Yes, I do.  And I have a stand-up bike in the house

          13   also.

          14   Q.     And so since the accident has happened, I think you

          15   testified that Mr. Bassett has -- that you have seen him

          16   something like 20 times since the accident happened.  Is

          17   that -- did I hear that accurately?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     And is this the same kind of thing, he would come

          20   down in the morning and stay all day and then leave in the

          21   early morning hours of the next day?

          22   A.     Yeah.  We worked out a routine.

          23   Q.     So how often after the accident was he coming to

          24   see you?

          25   A.     Again, maybe every two months.  'Cause now, the --
                                                                    117



           1   the -- the surgery is coming about, and we -- he was

           2   shopping for doctors, so to speak.  So he had to find a

           3   doctor that he wanted to perform the surgery.

           4   Q.     And so why -- why did he have to do that in

           5   Philadelphia, at your house versus in Kingston?

           6   A.     Why did he -- explain yourself again, sir.  Ask the

           7   question a different way.

           8   Q.     Well, I was asking you how often he came down, and

           9   you started talking about he was shopping for doctors, so

          10   I didn't really understand.  Was he researching doctors

          11   while he was with you?

          12   A.     Yes.  When we set out for the -- half of it, he did

          13   by phone and by conversations with other people to find a

          14   doctor that could repair his -- his -- his toe with a

          15   minimum amount of surgery and -- and disadvantage to

          16   himself physically.

          17   Q.     Well, when he would come to see you, are -- are the

          18   two of you going to doctors' offices to interview doctors?

          19   A.     Yes.  Yes.

          20   Q.     So you actually go to -- with him to doctors'

          21   appointments for the purposes of interviewing doctors to

          22   figuring out who the best surgeon would be for him?  Is

          23   that what you're telling me?

          24   A.     Yes.  As I recollect, he started at -- what do you

          25   call it? the Rothman Institute and gaining information
                                                                    118



           1   there, particular types of surgery and one of the better

           2   clinics or -- or hospitals with better quality of doctors

           3   that he couldn't find in the hometown --

           4   Q.     All right.  Let me ask you --

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     That's fine.  I don't mean to cut you off, but I'm

           7   just curious:  So how many different doctors did you go to

           8   with Mr. Bassett to interview them to figure out who the

           9   best doctor would be?  How many times did you actually do

          10   that?  How many different doctors did you go see with him

          11   in terms of shopping or searching for a doctor to perform

          12   his surgery?

          13   A.     Well, for his foot, I could remember twice visiting

          14   the Rothman Institute.  And then, after he found some

          15   information on Dr. Mann that he was -- I made maybe two or

          16   three visits before the actual operation.  He -- he liked

          17   the prognosis that Dr. Mann has given him.

          18   Q.     But in any event, so Mr. Bassett has been coming to

          19   see you about every other month since the accident,

          20   correct?

          21   A.     That's correct.

          22   Q.     And has that been primarily for the purposes of

          23   socializing with you?

          24   A.     No.  That -- for the past year and a half, it's

          25   been a wellness aspect for me and him.
                                                                    119



           1   Q.     Right.  And what does that mean?

           2   A.     It means that, to physically put yourself back

           3   together, you're gonna have to do something physical.  To

           4   psychologically put yourself back together, you're gonna

           5   have to do something psychological.  And we did both.

           6   Q.     All right.  So why is -- why -- what were you doing

           7   with him to assist him physically and psychologically?

           8   A.     Okay.  Psychologically, I was being his friend.

           9   Physically, I was helping him with his handicap, I would

          10   say.

          11   Q.     And how are you helping him with that?

          12   A.     Well, again, as a friend, I told him the -- the

          13   psychological impairments that he would go through.  Me

          14   having a stroke I alluded to -- to earlier, that I went

          15   through all the pains and ills physically and mentally,

          16   you know, and spiritually, if we can say that, being let

          17   down, being depressed.  I told him some of the -- the

          18   psychological dissidence he would have in going through

          19   trying to get well and stay in a permanent aspect in the

          20   reality of life.

          21   Q.     All right.  So -- and that was all -- all that

          22   assistance that you were giving to him was done by you in

          23   person with him, correct?

          24   A.     That's correct.

          25   Q.     And you think -- and that was the -- the principal
                                                                    120



           1   reason he was coming to see you every other month after

           2   the accident?

           3   A.     Yes.  He seen me -- I told him about a stroke that

           4   I had ten years ago, and I had did my --

           5   Q.     I understand all that.

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     All right.  And then, also, so when he would come

           8   down there, you guys would go out, and you'd go to lunch,

           9   and you would do other things, I take it, other than -- or

          10   would you primarily just, you know, sit in your -- your

          11   apartment or your house?

          12   A.     No.  We tried to do the things that he was somewhat

          13   able to do with limitations.  And by me being an old

          14   geriatric worker, I knew what his physical limitations

          15   were and how he could get through it.

          16   Q.     And -- and -- and how often do you talk with him on

          17   the phone?

          18   A.     Now, at least three to four times a week.

          19   Q.     And is he still coming down to see you?

          20   A.     The last he was here was just about two weeks ago.

          21   Q.     And what did you guys do during that visit?

          22   A.     I went with him to a -- I -- I think that that

          23   particular time, he was telling me that he was getting

          24   ready for a procedure with his postate.

          25   Q.     All right.  And did the -- did Mr. Bassett ever
                                                                    121



           1   tell you that he had injured that foot before?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     Did he ever tell you that -- that this injury

           4   caused a -- a prior injury to get worse?

           5   A.     He was telling me that his -- his gait was off.  He

           6   didn't walk as good as he used to walk.

           7   Q.     Yeah.  I'm talking about before the accident,

           8   did -- did -- did he ever have any kind of a limp, that

           9   you remember?

          10   A.     Yeah.  He -- he did have a small limp.  He told me

          11   about it in -- in passing.  Now that I recall, Marvin, at

          12   three years old, was shot accidentally with a shotgun

          13   and -- when he was an infant.

          14   Q.     Okay.

          15   A.     It was either an infant or --

          16   Q.     So prior to this accident, you remember him walking

          17   with a -- I think we can call it a small limp; is that

          18   correct?

          19   A.     That's correct.

          20   Q.     And did he ever talk with you about having -- and

          21   this is before the accident, sir -- did he ever talk with

          22   you about having pain in his foot?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     Did he ever talk to you about having gout in his

          25   foot?
                                                                    122



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     Did he ever talk to you about having gout?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     And -- okay.  Let me take a look here.  Has

           5   Mr. Bassett talked with you about whether or not he might

           6   have another surgery to his foot that would actually

           7   fuse -- fuse his big toe?

           8   A.     No, he didn't talk about another surgery.

           9   Q.     He hasn't talked with you about other things that

          10   he could have done for his foot?

          11   A.     No.  He's in the process of -- of seeing that this

          12   surgery that he just had, what type of ability he would

          13   have after the surgery.  He's based on getting well.

          14   Q.     And has he indicated to you that he feels like

          15   overall, he's been improving since the surgery was done?

          16   A.     No, he's not improving.

          17                  MR. SHERIDAN:  All right.  I think that's

          18   all I have.  Thank you.

          19                  MR. O'DONNELL:  I have no questions.  Thank

          20   you very much.

          21                  MR. CRANE:  That -- that's it.

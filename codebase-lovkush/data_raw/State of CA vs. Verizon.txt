          1                     Sacramento, California

          2               Friday, August 23, 2019 1:30 p.m.

          3                          ---o0o---

          4              THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm going to call the

          5    matter of State of California, ex rel., OntheGo Wireless

          6    versus Cellco Partnership, Case Number 2012127517.

          7              I think we'll start out by getting appearances

          8    on the plaintiffs' side.

          9              Sir.

         10              MR. GENSHLEA:  Joe Genshlea for the

         11    plaintiffs, Your Honor.

         12              MR. LAMPREY:  Wayne Lamprey with

         13    Constantine Cannon for the plaintiffs.

         14              MS. BONN:  Amanda Bonn with Susman Godfrey for

         15    Plaintiffs, Your Honor.

         16              And also with me in the back.

         17              MR. SPEAR:  Nick Spear, Susman Godfrey.

         18              THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

         19              MR. RICHTER:  John Richter, King & Spalding,

         20    for AT&T, Defendant.

         21              MS. VOIGTS:  Good afternoon, Your Honor.

         22    Anne Voigts from King & Spalding for AT&T.

         23              MR. COOCH:  Good afternoon, Your Honor.

         24    Peter Cooch from King & Spalding for AT&T.

         25              MR. CAMERON:  Scott Cameron of King & Spalding


                                                                      4





          1    for AT&T.

          2              MR. CHEIT:  Good afternoon, Your Honor.

          3    David Cheit with Greenberg Traurig for Verizon.

          4              THE COURT:  Okay.  Do we have somebody on the

          5    phone?  Okay.  Who's on the phone?  Hello?

          6              Ms. TSIOTSIAS:  I'm sorry, this is really bad

          7    feedback.  I can't hear anything that's going on.

          8              THE COURT:  Is that any better?

          9              MS. TSIOTSIAS:  Yes.  Thank you, Your Honor.

         10    Sorry, there was terrible feedback, and I couldn't hear

         11    anything that was going on.

         12              THE COURT:  Can you hear better now?

         13              MS. TSIOTSIAS:  Slightly.  But when I'm not

         14    speaking, there's static, and I can't hear anyone else.

         15              THE COURT:  Okay.  I don't think -- static is

         16    not coming from inside the courtroom, not yet anyway.  I

         17    don't know quite what to do about the phone.  Do you

         18    want to try calling back, hanging up and calling back

         19    and seeing if there's a better connection?

         20              MS. TSIOTSIAS:  Sure, I'll do that.

         21              THE CLERK:  I'll have to call you back, Ann.

         22              MS. TSIOTSIAS:  Okay.  Sounds good.  Thank

         23    you.

         24              (Off the record.)

         25              THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  The Court


                                                                      5





          1    posted its tentative ruling on the Report and

          2    Recommendation Number 17.  I assume everybody has seen

          3    it?  Fair?

          4              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.

          5              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes, Your Honor.

          6              THE COURT:  So I guess there's a little bit

          7    for everybody who wants to talk to me about.  I can

          8    start with Plaintiffs since you filed the motion.

          9              What would you like to discuss with the Court?

         10              MS. BONN:  Not much, Your Honor.  We had just

         11    a couple of questions.  Question number one is how Your

         12    Honor would prefer that we proceed in terms of a motion

         13    for attorneys fees and reasonable expenses.  Should we

         14    file that in the first instance before Justice Morrison

         15    or before Your Honor?

         16              THE COURT:  No.  You file it here.

         17              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.

         18              THE COURT:  That's a question of law and fact,

         19    and you file it here.

         20              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.

         21              And the only remaining question is, you know,

         22    I think that there remains some uncertainty about when

         23    we will receive the data and what impact, whatever date

         24    that is, might have on things, and so to the extent

         25    there are other collateral consequences that arise down


                                                                      6





          1    the road, we just wanted to make sure that the door is

          2    open for us to file an appropriate motion at that time.

          3              I understand that there's certain issues that

          4    Your Honor declined to reach at this time on this

          5    record.  We understand that.  We think that it makes

          6    sense.  But we just wanted to make sure that if there

          7    are other consequences that we don't currently

          8    anticipate based on the timing, that we can come back.

          9              THE COURT:  Are you talking about trial dates

         10    and failure to produce or something along the lines?

         11              MS. BONN:  Potentially, Your Honor, yes.

         12              THE COURT:  The door is always open for that.

         13    We will talk a little about timing once we get to the

         14    end of this hearing this morning.

         15              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.

         16              THE COURT:  Or this afternoon.

         17              MS. BONN:  That's it for Plaintiffs for now,

         18    Your Honor.

         19              THE COURT:  Thank you.

         20              So from AT&T's perspective.

         21              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Both I and

         22    Mr. Cooch will be addressing the -- what we'd like to --

         23    I'll pull this a little closer.

         24              The topic we would like to address is finding

         25    that AT&T abused or misused discovery.  And I'd like to


                                                                      7





          1    make two points.

          2              First, AT&T was not evasive in its responses.

          3    And second, it did not know that it would need to resort

          4    to invoices in order to complete the remainder of the

          5    production until Fall of 2018.

          6              Beginning with the first, or AT&T not being

          7    evasive.  Plaintiffs haven't taken issue with

          8    Justice Morrison's findings that the requests were

          9    complex and that there were changes.  The parties were

         10    engaging in an effort to meet and confer about ways to

         11    find the data within -- what existed with structured

         12    data.  Those requests were complex.  AT&T's databases

         13    are complex and multiple.  And that's what led to an

         14    extended discussion in good faith about what would

         15    actually satisfy Plaintiffs' needs.

         16              But granular voice usage data doesn't have a

         17    fixed meaning.  It wasn't clear to us what Plaintiffs

         18    wanted and what would satisfy their needs.  Clearly,

         19    they didn't need everything, so the question was, what

         20    did they need?

         21              And that leads us to the question of what AT&T

         22    did or did not know.  And to the extent that it was not

         23    clear from us arguing that it was unfair for

         24    Justice Morrison to conclude that we should have known,

         25    AT&T did not know that they would need to resort to the


                                                                      8





          1    invoices until Fall of 2018.

          2              That is also when AT&T began to understand

          3    exactly what it would take to reconstitute all of these

          4    invoices.  Because this is the first time that AT&T has

          5    ever undertaken a task this large and this significant.

          6    What we're talking about is reconstituting invoices

          7    that, unlike an individual invoice, can run to the

          8    hundreds or thousands of pages for 185,000 subscribers

          9    for more than ten years.

         10              We objected, as it turns out, completely with

         11    justification initially that -- that objection on burden

         12    was based on the fact that we had provided that data to

         13    Plaintiffs, both in structured and in invoice form.  And

         14    so we wanted some discussion about what is still needed

         15    to produce from that.  But ultimately, the parties chose

         16    to use structured data, because that's what was easiest

         17    for all the parties to work with, and we believed that

         18    that's what would satisfy.

         19              So with respect to what we needed to do, we

         20    were in discussion.  After the deposition of

         21    Ryan Brackeen, Plaintiffs sent us a letter asking for

         22    questions.  Those questions were related to structured

         23    data.  They're asking about tables and fields, which is

         24    language that applies to structured data, like the

         25    intelligence structured data.  We answered that as best


                                                                      9





          1    we could, but said we're continuing to look.

          2              THE COURT:  Slow down.

          3              MS. VOIGTS:  We answered that, as best we

          4    could, but we said we are continuing to look.  But then

          5    Plaintiffs shifted to say, no, please produce the RDOs,

          6    the raw data outputs from Premier.  And we said, great,

          7    we'll do that.  That is limited in time.  So what we

          8    would like do is have you tell us which fields in

          9    Premier would satisfy your needs so that we can figure

         10    out where else that might be in structured data and if

         11    we can satisfy that.

         12              Plaintiffs then chose to bring a motion to

         13    compel us to produce all usage data, all the structured

         14    data from our databases for one entity so that they

         15    could look at it and decide what they needed.  That was

         16    consistent with their representations in the Fall of

         17    2017 when they said give us a sample, we'll look at, and

         18    we'll decide if that meets our needs.  We gave them

         19    samples of Intelligence in the Fall of 2017.  We gave

         20    them the sample from Premier.  And we then proceeded to

         21    give them yet more samples.  Ultimately, we produced

         22    millions of lines of data from multiple databases.  All

         23    of this --

         24              THE COURT:  Wait.  In the Fall of 2017 when

         25    you gave them a sample of data from Intelligence, did


                                                                     10





          1    you give them invoices or just structured data?

          2              MS. VOIGTS:  No, Your Honor, just structured

          3    data, because that's what we understood that everyone

          4    wants.

          5              Take, for example, the parallel proceedings

          6    that were happening at the same time.  Sprint has

          7    produced -- later in 2018, Sprint had produced their

          8    invoices.  So then a motion to compel was brought by

          9    Plaintiffs because they didn't want the invoices.  They

         10    wanted the structured data.  That was their first

         11    resort.

         12              THE COURT:  As to Sprint?

         13              MS. VOIGTS:  As to Sprint.

         14              THE COURT:  Okay.  Let's not worry about

         15    Sprint.

         16              MS. VOIGTS:  But I think that undermines the

         17    fact that both sides were focused on seeing if

         18    structured data could provide a solution.  And this was

         19    a complicated issue.

         20              THE COURT:  Can we just focus on the

         21    communications for AT&T and Plaintiffs, please.

         22              MS. VOIGTS:  Sure.  So if I could address

         23    first, the communications that go into the voice usage

         24    data.  So going into the Brackeen depositions.  The

         25    Court acknowledged that these categories weren't spelled


                                                                     11





          1    out.  He was trying to answer, but he was answering in

          2    the context of structured data.

          3              Then the plaintiffs sent us a letter asking

          4    where certain fields are.  Fields is a term for specific

          5    structured data.  We answered that, and tried to make it

          6    clear that those fields don't exist exactly in

          7    Premier -- sorry, Intelligence -- but that we would look

          8    to others to see what we could come up with.

          9              At that point, Plaintiffs then shifted.  They

         10    dropped usage categories.  Usage categories don't come

         11    up again until the Fall of 2018.  We don't even hear

         12    about them until 2018.  And the categories that the

         13    plaintiffs are talking to us about in Fall of 2017 are

         14    different from the ones that ultimately they're talking

         15    about in Fall of 2018.

         16              So the question then is, we explained that

         17    with the RDOs there was a limit amount of time that data

         18    is held in Premier, so we asked them which fields would

         19    help them.  We asked several times, without response,

         20    which fields so that we can go and see where else we

         21    might have them.  And we don't get an answer.  Instead

         22    we get a motion, and we agreed to produce all these

         23    other samples that they then agreed to review, to look

         24    at and to decide if it meets their needs.

         25              And then in June of 2018, we get a memo from


                                                                     12





          1    Mr. Spear, an e-mail, in which he says, "Please confirm

          2    that you will produce all billing usage data

          3    intelligence" --

          4              THE COURT:  You need to slow down for the

          5    court reporter.

          6              MS. VOIGTS:  -- "from October 10th, 2006, to

          7    present for all Government Plaintiffs by

          8    June 30th, 2018.  This includes all fields related to

          9    billing and usage and the following intelligence

         10    tables", and it lists the tables.

         11              And I will spare the court reporter reading

         12    them because it is in the record.

         13              And says, "we believe these tables should be

         14    produced unfiltered, but at a minimum should contain all

         15    fields included in the following extracts."  The extract

         16    that AT&T has previously produced.  This was our

         17    agreement, to produce a comprehensive production that

         18    was exactly like the samples that we had previously

         19    done.

         20              In asking for that, Plaintiffs said in an

         21    effort to minimize AT&T's data production burden,

         22    Plaintiffs will not demand billing and usage data from

         23    other sources at this time.  And while they reserve

         24    their right to seek additional information if they

         25    needed to, if it's determined at a later date that more


                                                                     13





          1    billing and usage data is needed.  But at this point,

          2    they've already said we will look at the samples you

          3    give us, we will not ask for a comprehensive production

          4    if it won't satisfy our needs.  And they ask us to go

          5    ahead and run a comprehensive --

          6              THE COURT:  I'm sorry, repeat what you just

          7    said.

          8              MS. VOIGTS:  Sure.  So initially when we were

          9    talking about producing structured data.

         10              THE COURT:  And this one being what?

         11              MS. VOIGTS:  I'm sorry?

         12              THE COURT:  In which exchange?

         13              MS. VOIGTS:  So this began in Fall of 2017.

         14    When we were talking about producing structured data,

         15    the plaintiffs initially said -- and this is Exhibit --

         16    I'm sorry, this is in February of 2018.  Ms. Bonn

         17    said -- and the idea is here that if you actually were

         18    to produce all of the data for the entire 10-plus-year

         19    timeframe for these 30-something entities of hundreds of

         20    thousands of lines, it's a massive amount of data and a

         21    significant undertaking.

         22              And so what we don't want to have happen is

         23    have that whole production made, then find out something

         24    is missing or something is wrong with the format and

         25    have to do the whole thing over again.  And so instead


                                                                     14





          1    we've been working with Defendants to ask them to make

          2    sample productions for a single intervener, then having

          3    our experts look at that date --

          4              THE COURT:  I'm going to tell you again, you

          5    need to slow down.

          6              MS. VOIGTS:  My apologies, Your Honor.

          7              And then having our experts look at that data

          8    sample, ask the questions they have, and ask for

          9    supplementation.  We did that.  We provided samples from

         10    a range of databases.

         11              Had we understood from the beginning that what

         12    their final needs would end up being, it would have been

         13    easier and significantly less expensive for AT&T to

         14    conclude that the only way to get all of it was from the

         15    invoices.  But based on what we knew and what was

         16    communicated to us, we believe this comprehensive

         17    production of Intelligence --

         18              THE COURT:  Can I ask you a question?

         19              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes, Your Honor.

         20              THE COURT:  When was the first time that AT&T

         21    informed Plaintiffs that this data was available in this

         22    primary form in backup as invoices which could be

         23    produced as PDFs but it was in this backup thing that

         24    would take a lot of time to produce?

         25              MS. VOIGTS:  So when we discovered in Fall of


                                                                     15





          1    2018 that it would take -- that was when AT&T started

          2    figuring out what it would take to produce the invoices.

          3              THE COURT:  That's -- that's not really my

          4    question.  So if -- if -- and perhaps I didn't make it

          5    totally clear in my tentative ruling.

          6              It appeared to the Court that very early on,

          7    Plaintiffs were asking for invoices.  In fact, language

          8    to that effect appears.  And there was a variety of meet

          9    and confer letters that took place and meetings, but

         10    there was absolutely no, from what I could tell,

         11    affirmative representation from AT&T that it knew that

         12    it had this data, although it was in this backup format

         13    binary, find it difficult to obtain and perhaps

         14    expensive to obtain.

         15              In a perfect world, in response to these

         16    requests to produce, AT&T would have consulted with its

         17    client and whomever their experts were, and their

         18    clients would have said to them, hey, we do have these

         19    invoices, but they're not in an easily accessible

         20    format.  They're in this backup something or another.

         21    It might cost X number of dollars to produce.  Let's

         22    just go out there and tell them that.  And the Code says

         23    they have to pay for it anyway.  Let's move for a

         24    protective order, and have the Court tell them they have

         25    to pay for it.


                                                                     16





          1              Instead, what I read through all the

          2    documentation, which is over here, and, you know, pages

          3    and pages and inches and inches and stacks and stacks,

          4    is either AT&T didn't tell its lawyers, or AT&T's

          5    lawyers, for whatever reason, decided not to disclose

          6    it.  And it took us months and months and months to get

          7    to this point.  It might have been -- hindsight is

          8    20/20 -- that when you disclosed that, they would have

          9    said forget all this other stuff, just give me that, and

         10    we'll work out something to pay for it.

         11              So I do understand that there was a lot of

         12    back and forth on the forms of data that were produced.

         13    I do understand that perhaps Plaintiffs had most of the

         14    data that they might otherwise need from whatever these

         15    other prior productions have been, and that maybe they

         16    only need a limited amount of additional data from these

         17    invoices.  What I don't understand was why AT&T did what

         18    it did, and I got no real answer.  Neither did

         19    Justice Morrison get an answer to that, nor did the

         20    Court.

         21              Now, I'm cognizant of the fact, because I

         22    thought about this -- but, you know, I will not ask you

         23    when did you know and why didn't you disclose it,

         24    because I think that would invade the attorney-client

         25    privilege otherwise.  I'm not going do that.


                                                                     17





          1              But I can tell from the series of

          2    communications back and forth, it appears to the Court

          3    that AT&T was very evasive.  That was the ultimate

          4    conclusion that Justice Morrison reached.  That is the

          5    conclusion I independently reached on review of all of

          6    the documentation.

          7              And you know from reviewing the law in the

          8    area, that it doesn't have to be initial evasiveness.

          9    So ultimately, it doesn't really matter to me did AT&T

         10    know and not tell its lawyers?  Did the lawyers know and

         11    not tell the plaintiffs?  The only -- the only impact of

         12    that kind of information to the Court would be cases

         13    allow me to award fees and sanctions against the lawyers

         14    or against the client.  And I -- I ultimately concluded

         15    that I'm just going with the discovery sanctions, and

         16    I'm going to let you guys work that out with your

         17    client.

         18              But you have not shown me why AT&T didn't

         19    disclose this backup system Intelligence.

         20              I do understand from having reviewed all the

         21    information that AT&T gets millions and millions of

         22    lines of data all the time and they have to put it

         23    somewhere, so they put it there, and that may be an

         24    ordinary course of business type of thing.  I didn't

         25    find that to be -- an intentional placement of data


                                                                     18





          1    somewhere in order to avoid the presentation.

          2              I just think you guys were evasive and hid the

          3    ball, and whether or not it's you or your client, I

          4    don't know.

          5              So why don't we just focus on that.  I know

          6    you have all these communications.  I know you talked

          7    back and forth about structured data and do you want

          8    this and do you want that.  I don't see a response

          9    anywhere that indicates there is no invoices available

         10    in any system.  I don't see an affirmative statement to

         11    the fact that, you know, we have this stuff, but we

         12    can't give it to you right now in this format.

         13              And so when the Court looked at this, it

         14    decided that AT&T had been evasive.  It was not willing

         15    to say it was intentional.  It sounds like perhaps it

         16    got, you know, with all these discussions that went back

         17    and forth about let me test this, give me that, yada,

         18    yada, so I'm not finding it intentional, but I am

         19    finding it highly evasive.  So if you can just focus on

         20    that, because that's really the only thing that might

         21    even change my mind.

         22              MS. VOIGTS:  Okay.  So if I could start with

         23    the first point.

         24              THE COURT:  Okay.

         25              MS. VOIGTS:  Which I understand is, was it

          1    evasive for AT&T -- or what did AT&T say about the

          2    invoices or not say.

          3              THE COURT:  Right.  And where -- where in here

          4    is an answer in response to document production where

          5    you come out and say we have invoices stored in a binary

          6    mode, backup intelligence, that's not easily accessible

          7    from the very beginning.  And I run through the dates of

          8    the things that I was looking at.  So -- and I said it

          9    was a nonexclusive list, because there was a lot going

         10    on here.  So can you show me something, point me to an

         11    exhibit and let me look at it?

         12              Mr. COOCH:  Your Honor, Peter Cooch.  I just

         13    want to make something clear.  AT&T disclosed that it

         14    had the invoices.

         15              THE COURT:  When?

         16              MR. COOCH:  In April of 2017, and then again

         17    in the Summer of 2017.

         18              THE COURT:  Can you show me where --

         19              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.

         20              THE COURT:  -- in the --

         21              MR. COOCH:  Yes.  In Exhibit 1 to my

         22    declaration.  That is AT&T's response to Plaintiffs'

         23    request for production.

         24              THE COURT:  Okay.  Hold on.  Because your

         25    declaration is nine inches, and I don't have -- the one


                                                                     20





          1    that I have is not tabbed.  So this is your Exhibit 1,

          2    you said?

          3              MS. VOIGTS:  It's Exhibit 2, Your Honor.

          4    Defendant Cellco Wireless's Responses to Second Set of

          5    Request For Production.

          6              THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me --

          7              MS. VOIGTS:  If you give me a moment, Your

          8    Honor, I can produce the page.

          9              MR. COOCH:  Your Honor, Plaintiffs asked for

         10    the invoices at the outset of discovery, and AT&T

         11    responded to that specific request by objecting to the

         12    production.  And it explained that producing that --

         13              THE COURT:  What page -- can you just point

         14    me --

         15              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.

         16              THE COURT:  -- where you disclosed that you

         17    had those documents or the ability to produce those

         18    documents in a backup system?  Where?

         19              MR. COOCH:  Your Honor, we disclosed that we

         20    had the invoices.  What we did not disclose until the

         21    Fall of 2018 was the nature in which those --

         22              THE COURT:  Could you show me where you

         23    disclose that you had the invoices?

         24              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.  Page 52 of

         25    Exhibit Number 2.


                                                                     21





          1              THE COURT:  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  Can you

          2    find where that is?

          3              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.  Would you like

          4    to give you my copy?

          5              THE COURT:  I want you to find it in my copy,

          6    and you can tab it.

          7              MS. VOIGTS:  Your Honor, while Mr. Cooch is

          8    looking for it, can I add additional --

          9              THE COURT:  Yeah.  I just want to make sure

         10    that I have -- just so I have in my place keeper here.

         11              Mr. Cooch, you're looking at Exhibit 2 to your

         12    declaration, and you believe that AT&T disclosed the

         13    invoices on what date?

         14              MR. COOCH:  It was April -- sorry, Your Honor,

         15    this is the -- this is the wrong declaration.  So this

         16    is the declaration accompanying the objections to the

         17    report and recommendation, which incorporates my

         18    original declaration from the order to show cause

         19    motion.

         20              THE COURT:  Can I have that?  Give you a

         21    different file.  Why don't you give me what you have

         22    since it's going to take me a while to get through this.

         23              Okay.  So we're clear on the record, this is

         24    Exhibit 2 to what?

         25              MR. COOCH:  The declaration of Peter Cooch in


                                                                     22





          1    support of AT&T's opposition for the order to show

          2    cause.

          3              THE COURT:  Okay.  What did you highlight for

          4    me here?

          5              MR. COOCH:  AT&T's objection to producing

          6    invoices in response to Plaintiffs' request for

          7    invoices.

          8              THE COURT:  What was the dates of the request

          9    from Plaintiffs?

         10              MR. COOCH:  I have in my notes January --

         11    excuse me, yes, January 11th, 2017.  And AT&T responded

         12    on April 21st, 2017.

         13              THE COURT:  Okay.  And where in here does it

         14    talk about invoices?

         15              MR. COOCH:  The text should be highlighted,

         16    Your Honor.  If I may approach?

         17              The request is on an earlier page, and it's

         18    highlighted.  It's AT&T's objection.

         19              THE COURT:  Where does it actually say that

         20    you have the invoices?

         21              MR. COOCH:  So we're objecting to producing

         22    them, or acknowledging that we have them.

         23              THE COURT:  So this is how it reads:  AT&T

         24    objects to this request -- that's what they're doing --

         25    on the grounds that it's overbroad and unduly


                                                                     23





          1    burdensome, and that it requires AT&T to produce every

          2    invoice.  It sent over 300 different entities over a

          3    period spanning more than a decade.  While AT&T sent

          4    each and every invoice to each entity in the ordinary

          5    course of business.  Therefore, the request seeks to

          6    require AT&T to produce thousands of documents it has

          7    already produced to Plaintiffs.

          8              It doesn't say that it has it in a backup

          9    system.  It's objecting based on the fact that on the

         10    day-to-day basis of what went on between the parties,

         11    the plaintiffs got the invoices.  It said it would be

         12    unfair for AT&T to go through the expense and burden of

         13    producing these invoices again when they are already in

         14    the possession of the requesting party.

         15              Where does it affirmatively state that AT&T

         16    has these invoices in a backup system?  Where have you

         17    moved for a protective order for it other than objecting

         18    on the grounds that they got it?

         19              MR. COOCH:  So, Your Honor, we, again,

         20    disclose that we have the invoices.

         21              THE COURT:  Where?

         22              MR. COOCH:  On June 12th, 2017, when we filed

         23    our opposition brief to set document discovery deadlines

         24    and to compel responses to discovery.  And this is

         25    Exhibit 7.


                                                                     24





          1              THE COURT:  Okay.  I went over that.  I -- I

          2    did not include that in my ruling, addressing those

          3    specifically.

          4              MR. COOCH:  I don't recall you addressing them

          5    in the tentative, Your Honor.

          6              THE COURT:  Well, I talked about them.  Is

          7    this the PMK deposition?

          8              MR. COOCH:  It's not the PMK.  It's the

          9    motions practice relating to it.

         10              THE COURT:  Before whom?

         11              MR. COOCH:  Before Justice Morrison.

         12              THE COURT:  Okay.  Show me what you said.

         13              MR. COOCH:  We said --

         14              THE COURT:  Show me what you said.

         15              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.

         16              THE COURT:  Okay.  This is Exhibit 7 to what?

         17              MR. COOCH:  To the same declaration, my

         18    declaration in support of AT&T's opposition to the

         19    motion for an order to show cause.

         20              THE COURT:  So do you understand that part of

         21    the requirement under the Code of Civil Procedure is for

         22    you to state that you actually have something, that you

         23    are declining to produce it?  For whatever reason,

         24    you're declining to produce it?  In other words, an

         25    affirmative statement that we got this stuff?


                                                                     25





          1              MR. COOCH:  Your Honor, I think that's what we

          2    did.

          3              THE COURT:  The request is overbroad and

          4    unduly burdensome.  You're objecting to it, again.  And

          5    because it would require AT&T to produce every invoice

          6    spanning more than a decade, documents already sent to

          7    Plaintiffs in the ordinary course of business.

          8              MR. COOCH:  We're saying, Your Honor, that it

          9    would require us to produce every invoice.

         10              THE COURT:  So I think in my tentative ruling

         11    what I have said to you -- if there's more, I will look

         12    at it.

         13              What I said to you is the Code of Civil

         14    Procedure actually requires you to state we will produce

         15    on whatever basis.  We won't produce, even though we

         16    have it in this particular circumstances on electronic

         17    discovery, because we're going to move for a protective

         18    order because it's too costly or burdensome or

         19    otherwise, or we want Plaintiffs to pay 100 percent of

         20    the cost today, because that's what the Code requires.

         21              This doesn't make sense to me, because nowhere

         22    do you actually come out and say that you got it, it's

         23    backed up intelligence, or in this archive system that

         24    is there, until much later on down the line.

         25              I'm looking at your January 3rd, 2018,


                                                                     26





          1    response to your meet and confer letter.

          2              I'm also looking to your January 3rd, 2018,

          3    letter where you say, "After reasonable investigation,

          4    AT&T has determined that such granular usage data does

          5    not exist in the realm of AT&T's system of record.

          6    Plaintiffs should have their information in the file."

          7              How hard would have it have been, Mr. Cooch,

          8    to have basically said we've got this data, it's backed

          9    up in many some old binary archive, it's going to take

         10    us five or six months to produce it and hundreds of

         11    thousands of dollars to do it, we're objecting on the

         12    basis of burden, and because it's electronic data we

         13    want the plaintiffs to pay 100 percent?  Wouldn't that

         14    have been really clear?

         15              MS. VOIGTS:  Had we known that, Your Honor,

         16    had we understood that it could only be satisfied by the

         17    invoices with --

         18              THE COURT:  Oh, no, no, no, that's not the

         19    issue.  They ask for invoices.  They ask for invoices.

         20              MS. VOIGTS:  They ask for invoices.  We

         21    objected on the grounds of burden.  On meet and confer

         22    calls that we told them we could only produce invoices.

         23    It would be difficult to produce them, but there's no

         24    dispute.  And Plaintiffs haven't argued that they didn't

         25    know that we had the invoices.


                                                                     27





          1              The question is, who knew what when about the

          2    details of what it would take to produce them?  That's

          3    something AT&T didn't know, because it had never

          4    undertaken such a large -- never before.  It had to go

          5    and hire someone to evaluate how you can do it, to write

          6    code, which is what they're doing, to be able to

          7    generate this information from the underlying invoice

          8    archive.

          9              THE COURT:  Yeah.  And I am here to decide --

         10    I'm assuming you're going to file a motion for

         11    protective order, and I'm assuming you're going to do

         12    what you should have done months ago, which is ask the

         13    Court to consider ordering them to pay reasonable costs

         14    of the data production, which you should have done

         15    months ago if, in fact, you clearly and expressly in a

         16    non-evasive manner stated that this data was available.

         17              MS. VOIGTS:  I think, Your Honor, we did.

         18              THE COURT:  Well, that's where we disagree.

         19    That's where not only my perception is different than

         20    yours, but Justice Morrison's perception.  Again, I want

         21    to make it very clear that I reached mine independently

         22    of his, and I changed the remedy, so to speak, of what I

         23    think I found.

         24              MS. VOIGTS:  If I could address the chronology

         25    for one moment?


                                                                     28





          1              THE COURT:  Go ahead.

          2              MS. VOIGTS:  Because Your Honor is focusing on

          3    our responses to the RFPs in early 2017.  We objected on

          4    burden.  Said we weren't going to produce based on

          5    burden.  And then what ultimately ended up becoming the

          6    focus of the parties' efforts was the structured data.

          7    And the question was -- this is like any other civil

          8    litigation where you're trying to figure out a

          9    compromise that will get them what they need without, as

         10    they recognize, the substantial --

         11              THE COURT:  I did not fault AT&T for trying to

         12    get a compromise of what they think would satisfy

         13    without having to go into a deep dive.  I fault AT&T for

         14    not clearly advising at the earliest point that they

         15    were available and they knew about it, that this

         16    information was, in fact, available, not saying it does

         17    not exist, Intelligence, because apparently it does in

         18    some backup binary form, and then say it's too

         19    expensive, it's too much of a burden, so we're not going

         20    produce it unless you pay for it.

         21              MS. VOIGTS:  So if I could address the

         22    responses.  Focus on the January 3rd letter.  So I think

         23    your concern is the response to that.

         24              So in that response, we were addressing it in

         25    the context of the questions asked of Mr. Brackeen and


                                                                     29





          1    the context of those requests which went to structured

          2    data.  They were talking about fields and tables and

          3    where you could query them.  And so we were saying we

          4    don't think that's available Intelligence-structured

          5    data.  That's what we were talking about with

          6    Intelligence.  And then -- but we will look to see if we

          7    can find it in other places.

          8              Everyone in this case knew what existed in the

          9    invoices.  Plaintiffs have the invoices.  Later -- they

         10    ran a third-party optimization firm.  They know what

         11    they contain.  We were trying to find a solution that

         12    would give them the data in the best format.  Because we

         13    knew that the invoices were large, and that it involved

         14    a large amount of data.  But as to what it would take,

         15    there wasn't hiding the ball, because no one knew where

         16    the ball was, because when you're talking about

         17    generating from 185,000 customers over more than ten

         18    years, every invoice, that is extraordinarily difficult.

         19    It had not been done.  That's why they have to write the

         20    tool to do it.  It doesn't exist.

         21              THE COURT:  We're not even there yet on that

         22    issue in the sense that I understand that it's extremely

         23    difficult, at least I've been told.  And I understand it

         24    may be very expensive, at least that's what I've been

         25    told.  I have no evidentiary basis on which to support


                                                                     30





          1    that at this point in time, and if AT&T moves forward

          2    with it, you can look at the cases which talk about what

          3    kinds of things need to be submitted to a court in order

          4    to make that determination.

          5              So I get the point that you are -- that you

          6    are making.  I fully understand it.  Believe me, I do.

          7    You think you were doing the best that you could to

          8    provide alternatives and meet whatever you thought they

          9    were asking for.  Fair?

         10              MS. VOIGTS:  And we thought -- yes, Your

         11    Honor.

         12              THE COURT:  Okay.  So it wasn't -- I didn't

         13    find it intentional.  I made no finding of intentional.

         14    That's not required in order to find a misuse of

         15    discovery process.  But I did find it evasive.

         16              MS. VOIGTS:  Your Honor, if I could address

         17    those two points first?

         18              THE COURT:  Okay.

         19              MS. VOIGTS:  We'd agree that there's cases

         20    that say intent is not required, but we think when we're

         21    talking about evasive responses, the very definition of

         22    evasive is trying to hide the ball, and I think the

         23    cases that the Court relies on are substantially

         24    different than the case here.

         25              If you take, for example, Liberty Mutual, they


                                                                     31





          1    had three opportunities, after order after order after

          2    order, to fix their interrogatory responses.  And they

          3    didn't.  They kept giving the same responses.  Here,

          4    AT&T produced samples from different databases.  We put

          5    up ten PMQ witnesses to explain the different databases

          6    that existed.  We were trying very hard to meet the

          7    needs that Justice Morrison found were complex and

          8    changing on systems that are complex and difficult to

          9    understand.

         10              And Your Honor looked at sort of three things

         11    in finding that this was abuse, and one was the

         12    ten-month delay.  And you said that there was no

         13    satisfactory explanation for that.  And if I can take a

         14    moment to address that?

         15              THE COURT:  Please.

         16              MS. VOIGTS:  First, I think there is, when you

         17    look at what was happening in the ten months, which, as

         18    I read the Court's order, from January until October of

         19    2018.  What happened in that moment was we sent our

         20    response to the questions about where these categories

         21    are.  Plaintiffs then shift and say please produce RDOs,

         22    which don't have -- so usage categories drop out

         23    completely.  Invoices haven't been talked about since

         24    the year before.

         25              We then the produce that RDOs and explain --


                                                                     32





          1    we say multiple times, please tell us which fields you

          2    need, we will see where we can find them.  We move to

          3    compel, and we agree to produce samples from all the

          4    different databases to help meet those needs, to see

          5    what would satisfy their needs.  We did that.  And that

          6    took extraordinary effort on AT&T's part.  Had we known

          7    that we could have -- that the only way to get every

          8    piece of the information they wanted was to also go to

          9    the invoices, this could have -- I think undercuts the

         10    idea that we knew or should have known, because we

         11    didn't.

         12              Then we reach an agreement with Plaintiffs

         13    where they say we've -- that they want a production, a

         14    comprehensive production across all the entities that is

         15    the same that we produced to them before.  We understand

         16    that.  I mean, the representation from Plaintiffs was

         17    that what we had produced met their needs, as they

         18    understood at that point.

         19              We then -- they then come back to us, after we

         20    spend months of doing this production, and they say, no,

         21    no, these categories are missing.  These categories,

         22    first, are different than the usage categories they had

         23    been talking about the year before, earlier before.

         24    They changed.

         25              We explained that some of them were either in


                                                                     33





          1    or clearly derived from the tables.  And then as to the

          2    remainder, then we offered sort of two options.  We

          3    thought -- we earlier produced a sample from SCRAM that

          4    we thought could produce some of that data.  And

          5    alternatively invoices, and we tried looking into what

          6    it would take to produce those invoices, to get them out

          7    of -- what would it take to retrieve them.

          8              THE COURT:  When did you start doing that?

          9              MR. COOCH:  April of this year.

         10              THE COURT:  Of 2019?

         11              MR. COOCH:  Yes.

         12              MS. VOIGTS:  Creating the tool.  Investigating

         13    what it would take was earlier.  That's when the

         14    statement of declaration of what it would take to -- in

         15    the two declarations that were submitted on what it

         16    would take to generate the invoices.

         17              We agreed that we would produce the invoices.

         18    The question was who would bear the cost of it.  And

         19    AT&T has gone ahead and is moving forward -- Your Honor

         20    asked a question about when it would be complete.  So we

         21    will submit a declaration on that.  Our understanding,

         22    based on conversations this week, is that it will be

         23    complete by the end of this year.  And we are not just

         24    producing the invoices.  We are producing it and

         25    converting it into structured data as well.


                                                                     34





          1              THE COURT:  The end of 2019?

          2              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  And we will --

          3    and that's for the invoices.  We believe that the

          4    additional structured data will follow shortly

          5    thereafter.

          6              THE COURT:  The additional what data?

          7              MS. VOIGTS:  The structured data.  Because we

          8    are converting the invoices.  What has to happen is the

          9    tool will recreate the invoices.

         10              THE COURT:  Are you doing that for all 185,000

         11    subscribers at this point?

         12              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.

         13              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes.  We're beginning Phase One,

         14    and then we will produce Phase Two.

         15              THE COURT:  And as of right now, your

         16    understanding is Plaintiffs wants it for all the 185,000

         17    subscribers; is that your understanding?

         18              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes, Your Honor.

         19              THE COURT:  And have you had to hire outside

         20    experts to help you do this?  Or is all of this being

         21    done internally?

         22              MS. VOIGTS:  No.  We have had to hire people

         23    to do this, to write this code.  It's not something

         24    that -- something that AT&T had done previously or had

         25    experience doing, which is, again, what undercuts why we


                                                                     35





          1    think a finding of misuse of discovery is unwarranted.

          2              THE COURT:  So in listening to you talk about

          3    all the things that AT&T did do in efforts to provide

          4    information, there were a whole variety of categories

          5    and a whole variety of meet and confers where the

          6    parties seemed to agree on certain things that needed to

          7    be done.

          8              The focus of the discovery misuse that the

          9    Court has found so far is what were the costs,

         10    reasonable attorneys fees and otherwise, dealing with

         11    the information related to the actual fact that these

         12    backup -- I'm just going to shortcut it and say the

         13    backup data is available through a system.  In other

         14    words, I have yet to hear from Plaintiffs on this, and

         15    this will be, I anticipate, one of the issues that will

         16    be addressed in any motion for fees and costs, that

         17    agreements regarding other kinds of data that should

         18    have been produced or would be produced may not

         19    necessarily be transferable costs.

         20              Do you understand what I'm saying here?

         21              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes.  As I understand Your Honor,

         22    you're saying that the costs that you're discussing

         23    shifting or awarding as part of sanctions would be

         24    limited to the costs associated --

         25              THE COURT:  What are the costs directly to the


                                                                     36





          1    particular issues that the Court has so far found is

          2    evasiveness as to this data.  Okay.  I don't know how

          3    this gets parsed or otherwise.  I'm going to leave that

          4    up to all of you to try to figure out how to do it.  I

          5    just -- I do truly understand what you are telling me.

          6    I just don't agree with it.

          7              MS. VOIGTS:  I understand that.  May I raise

          8    some more points, Your Honor?

          9              THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

         10              MS. VOIGTS:  First, one of the other things

         11    that the tentative ruling relied on that we would like

         12    to address is why didn't AT&T tell the plaintiffs to

         13    look at their own data.

         14              THE COURT:  Why what?

         15              MS. VOIGTS:  Why did AT&T tell the plaintiffs

         16    to look at their own data.

         17              THE COURT:  Well, I don't think it was why

         18    they didn't tell them to look at their own data.  That's

         19    a common response.  It's equally available to you, or

         20    should be equally available to you.

         21              It's what the Court specifically -- just so

         22    you address what I was saying, what the Court was saying

         23    was that seemed to also be part of -- by the lack of an

         24    affirmative statement that this data, in fact, existed,

         25    albeit in a difficult location to get to.  Also, that


                                                                     37





          1    Plaintiffs should theoretically have access to all of

          2    this stuff because it had invoices every time.  I

          3    understand that.  I understand why you said that.

          4              It was the way that this was expressed in

          5    response to the requests.  Again, rather than coming out

          6    and saying we have the data, we just can't get to it

          7    easily.  It exists over here, and it's going to take a

          8    lot of money to do it.  And by the way, you should have

          9    a lot of this data yourself.  I get that.

         10              MS. VOIGTS:  And I think, Your Honor, that's

         11    what we were trying to say, was that we never denied

         12    that we had these invoices.  It was simply a question of

         13    burden.  We didn't spell out the burden, because we

         14    didn't know what it was.  We hadn't been asked --

         15              THE COURT:  You never affirmatively stated you

         16    had the data until fairly downstream.

         17              MS. VOIGTS:  I think, Your Honor, we did.

         18              THE COURT:  Well, that's where we differ.

         19    That's where we differ in the interpretation.

         20              MR. COOCH:  Your Honor, can I show you one

         21    more document related to that issue?  Because in -- this

         22    is Exhibit 3 to the declaration of Peter Cooch in

         23    support of the motion for an order to show cause.

         24              THE COURT:  Okay.  So it's in the big stack.

         25              MR. COOCH:  I have a copy to share with you,


                                                                     38





          1    if you like.

          2              So this is Plaintiffs' Responses to AT&T's

          3    Request For Production.  These are verified responses.

          4    In each of them they have a sentence talking about how

          5    they know that AT&T has the invoices.

          6              Thank you, Your Honor.  And that's from -- I

          7    will get the date for you.

          8              THE COURT:  Which -- which request are we

          9    talking about now?

         10              MR. COOCH:  For the record, the date is

         11    March 31st, 2017.

         12              THE COURT:  But what have you highlighted?

         13    Request Number 4; is that what you want me to look at?

         14              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.

         15              The language is, "Plaintiffs will not produce

         16    all copies of the invoices that AT&T already controls."

         17              THE COURT:  Wait, wait, wait.

         18              Request Number 4.  All documents pertaining to

         19    agreements between you and any wireless

         20    telecommunications service provider.  All agreements,

         21    all documents pertaining to agreements between

         22    January 1, 2005.  Okay.  And then what?  Go ahead.

         23              MR. COOCH:  And below that, there's some

         24    highlighted language that says, "Plaintiffs will not

         25    produce copies of all invoices that AT&T already


                                                                     39





          1    controls, but will instead produce representative

          2    examples."

          3              THE COURT:  That's a little stretch,

          4    Mr. Cooch.

          5              MR. CAMERON:  Your Honor, if I could address

          6    one point.  Scott Cameron.

          7              You said time and again that there's nothing

          8    in the record that talks about AT&T specifically saying

          9    we do have these invoices.  And frankly, it's not in the

         10    record because until today we didn't realize that

         11    specific precise issue was the issue.  We did tell them

         12    that.  I told them that.

         13              THE COURT:  You didn't realize until today?

         14              MR. CAMERON:  That that specific thing,

         15    telling them that the invoice -- that we had the

         16    invoices was -- was anything in dispute or was at issue.

         17              THE COURT:  That you have the issues -- the

         18    invoices in a binary system backup that you could

         19    produce except it would be extremely expensive to do so?

         20              MR. CAMERON:  Right.  In meet and confer calls

         21    in late 2017 -- I don't have the exact date.  I would

         22    have put this in a declaration if we had understood this

         23    precise issue was important to this motion or to the

         24    Court.  But we did tell the plaintiffs, or I told the

         25    plaintiffs on a meet and confer call at least once, that


                                                                     40





          1    the invoices that we have -- we didn't say they were in

          2    a binary backup.  I wasn't sure -- I didn't know that

          3    they were in a binary backup.  But what was conveyed to

          4    me from AT&T and what I conveyed to Plaintiffs'

          5    attorneys was for AT&T to produce the invoices, we have

          6    to do them one at a time for each customer and print

          7    them one at a time.  And that was the basis for our

          8    burden objection, one of the bases for our burden

          9    objection.  And that we said it was unfair since we have

         10    already produced them, and Plaintiffs could get them as

         11    equally as we could.

         12              I just wanted to make sure Your Honor

         13    understood that right from the beginning in 2017 we did

         14    tell them that, yes, we have these, but it would be very

         15    hard for us to produce because we would have to do them

         16    one at a time.

         17              THE COURT:  Frankly, Counsel, I don't know

         18    what to do with that.  Because there's nothing here in

         19    the record in front of me that affirmatively states

         20    that, nor in any of the language in the documents that

         21    were either submitted to myself or before

         22    Justice Morrison that make that representation.  But

         23    thank you.  I hear what you're saying.

         24              Let me hear from Plaintiffs, please.

         25              MS. BONN:  Thank you, Your Honor.


                                                                     41





          1              Plaintiffs think that Your Honor is correct

          2    that the issue is that -- is not that -- the burden is

          3    the problem, the method of producing, the discussions.

          4    That's not really the issue.  It's beside the point.

          5              The point is that how could we have had a

          6    fair, full and efficient dialogue without knowing or

          7    understanding what is the situation with this data?  And

          8    we had to spend over a year, a lot of attorney time,

          9    motion practice, hearings, just to get a simple answer

         10    to the question we were trying to figure out at the

         11    outset.

         12              Part of why we served this PMQ notice early on

         13    is we anticipated -- this is a lot of data, of course it

         14    is.  We anticipated -- I doubt any of the carriers have

         15    ever dealt with a litigation that required the

         16    production of this kind of data on this sort of a scale.

         17    So we as plaintiffs understood that, and part of what we

         18    tried to do from the outset is to say, look, we want to

         19    take early depositions and ask the questions we have

         20    about how your systems work, where do you keep this

         21    information, do you have archive systems, what is the

         22    burden associated with restoring any backups.  Let's put

         23    all our cards on the table so that we can then actually

         24    have a productive discussion about what do we really

         25    need, what can reasonably be produced, and if there's


                                                                     42





          1    any problems, let's deal with it and head it off at the

          2    pass.

          3              And so we agree with Your Honor that that's

          4    really the core issue.

          5              And in the Fall of 2017 when we took this PMK

          6    deposition, we asked about different categories of

          7    information.  Peak minutes, mobile-to-mobile minutes,

          8    international minutes.  And Mr. Brackeen's testimony was

          9    that he wasn't sure where we could find it,

         10    Intelligence.  He didn't say clearly it's not there,

         11    it's not kept in a structured data format.  He mentioned

         12    this binary -- he didn't use the word "binary."  He

         13    mentioned there was a backup archive, but his testimony

         14    suggested it was limited to closed accounts, and that

         15    for other accounts, all the data should be Intelligence

         16    and Inception.  He just wasn't in a position to tell us

         17    where.

         18              And so after that deposition we thought, okay,

         19    well, let's just follow up with AT&T.  Let's try to get

         20    to the bottom of this.  And our letter in the Fall of

         21    2018 said tell us what fields Intelligence records, the

         22    following categories of information, categories of data.

         23    If the answer to this question is better answered by

         24    referenced to some other database or other system, tell

         25    us what that is.  And we also followed up and said, tell


                                                                     43





          1    us more about this archive.

          2              I think a truthful and complete answer to our

          3    letter that was non-evasive would have said, some of the

          4    categories of data you're asking about are recorded

          5    intelligence, albeit briefly.  It's kept there for,

          6    approximately, three months, and then we back it up to a

          7    binary archive.

          8              Mr. Brackeen's testimony was somewhat

          9    incomplete.  The archive does relate to closed accounts,

         10    but it also relates to other accounts, and here's the

         11    issue with the data.  We think there's a burden, let's

         12    meet and confer.  Had that happened in the Fall of 2017,

         13    this issue could have completely resolved a year

         14    earlier.

         15              And part of the issue is what Your Honor said,

         16    that there wasn't even a clear representation that the

         17    invoices existed, or the format in which they existed,

         18    and the, you know, specifics of the binary archive.  But

         19    also part of it is that yes, if the data existed in a

         20    structured format that would be less burdensome to

         21    produce, of course we were interested in that.  And so

         22    we were trying to figure out does it exist, and it took

         23    way too long to just tell us no, it doesn't, it doesn't

         24    exist in a structured format.  The only place it can be

         25    found is the binary archive.


                                                                     44





          1              And I guess I would like to end with, you

          2    know, one other point, because I think it shows how this

          3    could have been handled differently.  The example of

          4    Sprint that was brought up.  It's not directly at issue.

          5    But in Sprint's case, they told us early on we got these

          6    invoices.  This is how --

          7              THE COURT:  Okay.  I really do not want to

          8    head off that direction, because I stopped AT&T from

          9    going in that direction, so I don't think that's fair.

         10              MS. BONN:  Fair enough, Your Honor.

         11              I suppose the point is, had AT&T said

         12    something in the Fall of 2017, I think this could have

         13    been dealt more efficiently with fewer resources spent

         14    and more timely.

         15              THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

         16              Is there anything further from AT&T?

         17              MS. VOIGTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Very briefly,

         18    if I may.

         19              THE COURT:  Go ahead, yes.

         20              MS. VOIGTS:  Ms. Bonn talked about wanting to

         21    have a fair, full and efficient dialogue.  That

         22    certainly was what AT&T hoped for and tried for.  And I

         23    understand that Your Honor disagrees, but I don't think

         24    the record supports a finding that we were evasive or

         25    that we knew that the only way to complete the


                                                                     45





          1    production, most of which was satisfied by the

          2    productions we've made, was to resort to the invoices.

          3    Or even beyond that, that we knew what it would take in

          4    order to produce all of these.

          5              Everyone, Plaintiffs and Defendants, assumed

          6    that the invoices existed.  There really was not a

          7    dispute about that.  But that wasn't an issue because we

          8    wanted to see, both parties wanted to see if it was

          9    possible to get the information from structured data.

         10    We believed it was.  Plaintiffs represented it was when

         11    asking us to make a complete production.

         12              THE COURT:  Did they know, when you said they

         13    thought they could get what they needed from the

         14    structured data, that you had them in the backup system?

         15              MS. VOIGTS:  They knew that we had the

         16    invoices.

         17              THE COURT:  Did they know you had the invoices

         18    in the backup binary system that if they gave a half a

         19    million dollars for they could get?  You told them that

         20    you have this data; we can get you the invoices with all

         21    the line-by-line information by each of the 185,000

         22    subscribers, but it's going to cost you a lot of money?

         23    Did you tell them that?

         24              MS. VOIGTS:  They knew we had the invoices.

         25    They knew we objected on burden.  We knew --


                                                                     46





          1              THE COURT:  Okay.  We're going in circles.

          2    They knew, they knew, they knew, and I don't agree that

          3    they knew from the information that they were provided.

          4    Or I don't agree that it was less than evasive.

          5              MS. VOIGTS:  I think -- to conclude this

          6    evasive -- or that it was evasive, ultimately ignores

          7    the context of what was happening here.  The invoices,

          8    after the initial objections, they were never the focus

          9    of discussion, because everybody was looking at the

         10    structured data.  Everyone thought that the structured

         11    data could handle the issue.  And the reason why there

         12    were no questions of what burden it would impose for us

         13    to produce it, although as Mr. Cameron explained we did

         14    tell them it would be burdensome to produce.

         15              And then when it become clear the only way to

         16    fill in the interstices for production was to turn to

         17    the invoices, then we're looking at what it would

         18    actually take to do it with the tools.

         19              We don't think the record supports a finding

         20    of misuse of discovery.  We don't think that AT&T was

         21    evasive.  And we certainly don't think the record

         22    supports that we knew that the only way to satisfy

         23    Plaintiffs' request as they evolved was ultimately by

         24    also resorting to the invoices.

         25              THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.


                                                                     47





          1              I do understand that this is a

          2    highly-contested issue.  I really have not heard

          3    anything today that changes my mind.  But let me offer

          4    this point of clarification.

          5              I am anticipating that the Court will receive

          6    both a motion for a protective order regarding whatever

          7    payment the costs are associated under the Code.  I am

          8    expecting that Plaintiffs will very carefully analyze

          9    whether or not they need all of this data, because

         10    there's a possibility that you're going to be paying 100

         11    percent for it, or whether or not the data that's

         12    already been disclosed to you, you have enough of what

         13    you need.

         14              However, AT&T has already started to extend

         15    expenses going down that path.  So I'm going to handle

         16    these two competing motions directly.  We're not going

         17    to go through the discovery referee on this.  So -- and

         18    I anticipate that Plaintiffs will file their motion

         19    consistent with the Court's ruling.

         20              And I just caution Plaintiffs that this is not

         21    a blank check to throw the kitchen sink in on this and

         22    all of your cost of discovery related to data and

         23    documentation, because there is a history here that you

         24    have received a substantial amount of information,

         25    albeit not the invoices per se, and I'm not going to


                                                                     48





          1    give you, you know, everything that you think you've

          2    perhaps extended for all your discovery under the

          3    circumstances.

          4              So where this will ultimately end up, who owes

          5    who what and how much each side owes the others, I don't

          6    know at this point.  But I will also ask that when you

          7    each submit your respective papers, that you be aware of

          8    the fact that, like an attorney fee motion or any other

          9    kind of motion, it has to be well-substantiated, kind of

         10    along the Federal model.  It's not just like here's the

         11    declaration, and then you have to oppose it, and then

         12    you have to come up with the documentation.  I want to

         13    see in the first instance what you're claiming, why

         14    you're claiming, and what it's for, whatever costs are

         15    related to that.  So -- so that's that.

         16              As far as Defendants' request for payment or

         17    reimbursement of costs associated with production of

         18    this data, I need to see some evidentiary basis for what

         19    are the reasonable costs of producing this data.  And it

         20    cannot be necessarily a declaration by an attorney.  I

         21    need to know if you have hired -- the reason why I ask

         22    you have you hired experts, I need to hear from them,

         23    and I need to know if there's contract prices out here,

         24    what you're paying these people and what the personnel

         25    costs, or whatever else it is.  Because you're only


                                                                     49





          1    entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of

          2    production.

          3              So if Plaintiffs are going to stand at this

          4    point forward I want all 185,000 subscriber invoices and

          5    they believe that is necessary, then there -- there will

          6    be a challenge as to whether or not those costs are

          7    necessary.  There would be a challenge as to, if there's

          8    going to be one, what the costs are, and if they're

          9    reasonable.  And I truly think we -- in a perfect world,

         10    we could have gotten here a lot quicker and a lot less

         11    money spent by everybody on both sides.

         12              And, Mr. Richter, you want to talk to me?

         13              MR. RICHTER:  Just on your last point, Your

         14    Honor.

         15              THE COURT:  Okay.

         16              MR. RICHTER:  I guess I make a proposal in the

         17    spirit of trying to find some efficiency, given what

         18    we're confronting from both sides.  And I wondered

         19    whether it would be -- the Court would be amenable to

         20    holding its ruling on this issue --

         21              THE COURT:  On which issue?

         22              MR. RICHTER:  On the current pending --

         23              THE COURT:  Misuse?

         24              MR. RICHTER:  The ruling on the R&R 17.  For a

         25    short period of time, a reasonable period of time, for


                                                                     50





          1    Plaintiffs, who obviously would be facing a motion on

          2    our behalf with costs associated with it, and for

          3    Defendants, who obviously would be facing a fee petition

          4    of some sort on their side, to consult with one another,

          5    and see if we could come to some agreement on how to

          6    resolve this so that we don't, obviously, further burden

          7    the Court with litigation associated with this.

          8              As we know, this is all a sideshow in terms of

          9    actually now getting the work done, and doesn't actually

         10    further the underlying litigation.  And so I put that

         11    before the Court, and ask perhaps a brief pause in terms

         12    of the Court entering the order so the parties could

         13    confer.

         14              THE COURT:  Why don't we do this, because I

         15    have some other issues I want to discuss with counsel.

         16    Why don't we take a break now for about 10 or 15

         17    minutes.  Come back at 3 o'clock.  That will give you,

         18    both sides, an opportunity to maybe chat for a couple of

         19    minutes about whether or not that's even an acceptable

         20    thing for both sides to do, and you can come back and

         21    tell me that.

         22              And I then want to talk about the other issues

         23    that I kind of outlined that we need to at least touch

         24    base on today.  And I do -- I will say this:  With

         25    respect to the trial schedule for Verizon, I'm just


                                                                     51





          1    basically going to tell the parties to sit down and tell

          2    me what you can agree to and what you can't agree to,

          3    and if you can't agree to it, then just default to the

          4    statutory code dates and time period.  I'm not going to

          5    arbitrate between anybody.  If you can reach an

          6    agreement on these dates, great.  I'm going to order

          7    that you provide that to the Court by a certain date.

          8    You can tell me when we come back what date you want to

          9    do that by.

         10              I did notice the phraseology, an advanced

         11    court date or expedited court date.  My response to that

         12    is, this is a delayed court date from the original, so I

         13    can play the word language back and forth with everybody

         14    here, but that's not going to help us.  I want to know

         15    that everybody is going to be ready when they need to be

         16    ready, and I already said that if for some reason it's

         17    not possible, I will look at it then.  But playing with

         18    verbs, I can do that all day long.

         19              So let's take a break, and we will be back at

         20    3 o'clock.

         21              (Off the record.)

         22              THE COURT:  We are back on the record.

         23              Mr. Richter, what, if anything, came out of

         24    your brief discussion?

         25              MR. RICHTER:  Well, I know you will find it


                                                                     52





          1    disappointing, but we came to an agreement.  And so I

          2    think what we would like to do is ask the Court jointly

          3    to hold a final order in abeyance.  We'd ask for three

          4    weeks.

          5              THE COURT:  And does that mean neither side is

          6    going to be filing any motions for at least the next

          7    three weeks?

          8              MR. RICHTER:  That would be correct, Your

          9    Honor.  Yes, Your Honor.  And we would -- I think we

         10    commit to report to the Court whether we have been able

         11    to resolve things on both issues ourselves, or whether

         12    we're going to need to seek additional time for some

         13    other reason, or go back to fight.

         14              THE COURT:  Ms. Bonn?

         15              MS. BONN:  Agreed, Your Honor.  I think it

         16    makes sense, given the guidance from the Court today, to

         17    see if there's further room for discussion.  And I don't

         18    see it prejudicing anything to hold it in abeyance for

         19    three weeks, understanding that AT&T is not holding off

         20    on the --

         21              MR. RICHTER:  That's -- that's correct.  Yeah,

         22    we are not.  We are full steam ahead on the underlying

         23    substance.

         24              THE COURT:  Okay.  So by stipulation of the

         25    parties then, I will hold off issuing a final until


                                                                     53





          1    September 16th.

          2              And I would ask that the parties communicate

          3    with the Court either by joint e-mail or letter before

          4    the close of business on the 19th, and advise what the

          5    next step would likely be.

          6              MR. RICHTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.

          7              THE COURT:  Okay.  On some of the other

          8    matters that I wanted to talk to counsel about, I think

          9    we have a date now set for the demurrer.  That's coming

         10    up in September sometime, and I think I've gotten

         11    Defendants' moving papers.

         12              Did you -- I don't know if there's even time

         13    to file your opposition.  Have you?

         14              MS. BONN:  It hasn't been filed yet.  Our

         15    deadline is coming up, and we are on pace to meet that

         16    deadline.

         17              THE COURT:  I just wanted to make sure,

         18    because sometimes it takes a while for the papers to

         19    make it out to me.

         20              In addition, I have two proposed

         21    recommendations after this one, the 17th one, the 18th

         22    and 19th, that have been filed by Justice Morrison.  I

         23    believe that the time for any objections to Number 18

         24    has passed, and I wanted to confirm that nobody has

         25    filed any objections to Number 18.


                                                                     54





          1              MR. CHEIT:  Your Honor, Dave Cheit for

          2    Verizon.  I think if there were -- if there was going to

          3    be objections, they would be ours, and we're not

          4    objecting.

          5              MS. BONN:  Correct, Your Honor.

          6              THE COURT:  Okay.  Then I'm going to sign off

          7    as an order on Report and Recommendation Number 18.

          8    This needs to be filed and endorsed today and sent

          9    downtown for services and uploading to CCS.

         10              Now, as to 19, I got an e-mail this morning --

         11    or yesterday from Justice Morrison saying there's a

         12    motion to reconsider on 19.  So what's the timing on

         13    that, if you know?

         14              MS. VOIGTS:  Your Honor, it's been -- we have

         15    a briefing schedule set and a time to argue it.  It's

         16    about two custodians that may or may not come up to you

         17    because Plaintiffs agree that they don't have issues

         18    with the documents.  So the issue is about the test

         19    that's being implemented.

         20              THE COURT:  The issue is about the test?

         21              MS. VOIGTS:  What we review as extra language.

         22              THE COURT:  Okay.  So timing-wise, you have a

         23    hearing scheduled before Justice Morrison?

         24              MS. VOIGTS:  We do, Your Honor.

         25              THE COURT:  And when is that?


                                                                     55





          1              MS. VOIGTS:  I will have to confirm that.

          2    It's in early September.  But I will -- I will confirm

          3    that.

          4              THE COURT:  Okay.  So I need something

          5    basically filed saying that -- you know, asking the

          6    Court to hold off on that.  Because the way the orders

          7    generally read, if I don't get an objection before that,

          8    I just sign the order.  So you've now told me that you

          9    want to hold off on 19, but I would like something

         10    filed, please, for that.

         11              MS. VOIGTS:  We will be happy to do so, Your

         12    Honor.

         13              THE COURT:  Okay.  I think I need an updated

         14    proof of service.

         15              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Should we file

         16    that or e-mail that to an e-mail address?

         17              THE COURT:  Well, I think you should probably

         18    file it.  You should file it as a document, and then the

         19    clerks downtown, I will just tell them that's -- you

         20    could also e-mail it to my clerk.  That would be great

         21    as well.

         22              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Will do.

         23              THE COURT:  I mentioned about the timetable

         24    for Verizon.  When do you want to have that -- when can

         25    you meet and confer on that and file -- I know you


                                                                     56





          1    started to do that.  I saw that with the case management

          2    conference.  But I need something where you say, we've

          3    agreed on these dates.  This one we're going -- we're

          4    just defaulting to the CCP.  And I actually need you to

          5    give me the date, please, so I can put that into an

          6    order.

          7              So when would you like to get that to the

          8    Court?

          9              MR. CHEIT:  A couple of weeks.

         10              MS. BONN:  How about Friday, September 6, two

         11    weeks from now?

         12              THE COURT:  Is that okay?

         13              MR. CHEIT:  I think so.  I'm not the only

         14    person that would be working on that on my team.  But

         15    speaking for everybody anyway, sure.

         16              THE COURT:  We will make it the 13th of

         17    September.  Friday the 13th.

         18              MR. CHEIT:  There you go.  That's an

         19    auspicious day.

         20              THE COURT:  Okay.  As I said, I have reviewed

         21    the case management conference statement.  I know

         22    there's still a bunch of issues.  You're still seeing

         23    Justice Morrison.

         24              Anything else we need to talk about today?

         25              MS. BONN:  Not from Plaintiffs, Your Honor.


                                                                     57





          1              MR. RICHTER:  Not from AT&T, Your Honor.

          2              THE COURT:  Okay.

          3              MR. RICHTER:  Oh, I guess the only other --

          4    there is the request from the New York AG's, the

          5    stipulation that we filed.

          6              THE COURT:  Oh, I think I -- I hope I signed

          7    that.  I know what you're talking about.  I seem to

          8    recall that I signed it and they sent it downtown.  It

          9    was the stipulation to allow disclosure of certain

         10    information.  I think I signed that a couple of days ago

         11    and ask that it go downtown.

         12              Can we just check on that and make sure that

         13    that's happened?

         14              What's the title of the document?

         15              MS. BONN:  It looks like Stipulation and

         16    Proposed Order for Amendment to Protective Order.

         17              MR. RICHTER:  For the Court's sake, it was

         18    Exhibit A to the case management conference, joint case

         19    management conference that was filed.

         20              THE COURT:  But didn't you also file it

         21    earlier than that too?

         22              MS. BONN:  I don't believe so, Your Honor.

         23              MR. RICHTER:  Yeah, I don't believe so, Your

         24    Honor.

         25              THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, then -- didn't you


                                                                     58





          1    raise the topic --

          2              MS. BONN:  We did discuss it.

          3              MR. RICHTER:  We did.  But we discussed the

          4    concept before Your Honor, and I think there was various

          5    back and forth about how to -- how to address it, how to

          6    address the underlying request with the New York AG's

          7    office, and we were finally able to come to an

          8    agreement.

          9              THE COURT:  Okay.  I just signed.  I took one

         10    off and signed it.  Okay.

         11              You told me that in your presentation from

         12    AT&T that, at least as of right now, you think all the

         13    data would be prepared and produced by December of this

         14    year.  That's the current estimate?

         15              MR. COOCH:  Yes, Your Honor.

         16              THE COURT:  Okay.

         17              MR. COOCH:  And I'm sorry, Your Honor, that

         18    applies to the invoices itself.  We're also working on

         19    converting those invoices, I think as Ms. Voigts said,

         20    the structured data, and we're producing that as well.

         21    We don't have an exact timing on that, but our

         22    understanding is that it won't be far behind the

         23    invoices.  That's in addition to --

         24              THE COURT:  That's something that Plaintiffs

         25    asked you to do?


                                                                     59





          1              MR. COOCH:  We decided to do it unilaterally,

          2    and we're not seeking cost for it.

          3              MR. RICHTER:  So, essentially, it's just

          4    taking the information from the invoices, and trying to

          5    put it into spreadsheets that would allow you to

          6    manipulate, really, the data, so you're not just dealing

          7    with a raw invoice itself.

          8              THE COURT:  So it's for both sides' benefit?

          9              MR. RICHTER:  Both sides.  It would have some

         10    benefit to both sides.

         11              THE COURT:  That's not a cost that you're

         12    asking them to pick up, because you decided to do it

         13    unilaterally?

         14              MR. RICHTER:  We decided we would need -- if

         15    we're going down this road, we will need it all.

         16              THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Let me see if

         17    there's something else here.

         18              And you don't know how long that's going to

         19    take?

         20              MR. COOCH:  No, Your Honor, we don't have an

         21    exact date.  But the plan is to do it on a rolling basis

         22    as we do the invoices, so we're just working on the

         23    timing for that.

         24              THE COURT:  Okay.  And I did see also in the

         25    case management conference report.  Where are we in


                                                                     60





          1    regards to the Sprint settlement?  As well for the

          2    benefit of the person who is on the phone.  So

          3    everything is going okay with that, as far as you know,

          4    Ms. Bonn?

          5              MS. BONN:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is one lone

          6    intervener who's -- sign off on the term sheet we're

          7    still working on.  We are trying to expedite that.

          8              In the meantime, I believe we are actually

          9    either very close or finalized on a long-form settlement

         10    agreement, and we anticipate filing a motion for

         11    preliminary approval shortly.  In the month of

         12    September.

         13              THE COURT:  Okay.  Is the amount confidential

         14    or no?

         15              MS. BONN:  I don't believe so.  I don't happen

         16    to have that off the top of my head.  I apologize, Your

         17    Honor.

         18              THE COURT:  It's okay.  It's okay.  Just

         19    wondering.  I was also checking, because I'm not sure it

         20    can be -- okay.  All right.

         21              There was one other matter that I did want to

         22    talk to the attorneys about, but I do not want to do

         23    that in open court.  So I prefer, if you all don't mind,

         24    just coming back, and we will go off the record here

         25    now.


                                                                     61





          1              Is there anything else that we need to talk

          2    about?

          3              MS. BONN:  Not from Plaintiffs, Your Honor.

          4              MR. RICHTER:  Not from Defendant AT&T.

          5              MR. CHEIT:  No, Your Honor.

          6              THE COURT:  And our attorney on the phone from

          7    Sprint, is there anything that you need to talk about?

          8              MS. TSIOTSIAS:  Nothing from Sprint, Your

          9    Honor.  Thank you.

         10              THE COURT:  All right.  Then if I don't see

         11    you before, I will see you in September.

         12              That's a song, isn't it?

         13              All right.  Thank you.

         14              We're off the record.

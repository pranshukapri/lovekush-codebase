 1        THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are now on the

 9        This deposition is being held at 1251 May

 4                       EXAMINATION
 5   BY MR. CUEVAS:
 6        Q    Leigh, we met off the record earlier
 7   briefly, but for fullness of the record, my name is
 8   Jesse-Justin Cuevas, and I represent the defendants
 9   in this case.
10             And I am going to refer to the defendants
11   collectively as Walmart.  Is that fair?
12        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
13        Q    Yes?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    So if I say "Walmart," I mean Walmart
16   Stores, Inc., Walmart Stores East, LP, and Walmart
17   Stores East, Inc.  Does that make sense?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    Please state your name for the record.
20        A    Sherry Leigh West.
21        Q    Ms. West, what is your home address?
22        A    50 Pritchard Street, Bluffton, South
23   Carolina, 29910.
24        Q    And you're the daughter of William
25   Randolph West, right?
0006
 1        A    Correct.
 2        Q    I understand that people called him
 3   Randy.
 4        A    Correct.
 5        Q    Do you mind if I call him that, or would
 6   you prefer Mr. West?
 7        A    Mr. West, please.
 8        Q    Sure.  Firstly, I'm very sorry that your
 9   father was injured, and I'm deeply sorry for your
10   loss, and I really appreciate you being here today.
11   I understand that at times this could be difficult
12   today, so we'll just go at your pace.
13        A    Okay.
14        Q    Have you ever been deposed before?
15        A    No.
16        Q    Okay.  Have you ever testified in a court
17   of law or any administrative proceeding?
18        A    No.
19        Q    You do understand that you're testifying
20   under the penalty of perjury today?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    So even though there's not a judge or a
23   jury in the room, that means that you are
24   testifying today the same as if we were in a
25   courtroom.  Does that make sense?
0007
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    Okay.  Can you think of any reason why
 3   you can't give your full and truthful testimony
 4   today?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    Are you under the influence of any
 7   medications that would impact your ability to give
 8   full and truthful testimony today?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    Any drugs?
11        A    No.
12        Q    Or any alcohol?
13        A    No.
14        Q    And you don't have any medical conditions
15   that would impact your ability to testify
16   truthfully and accurately today?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Just a few ground rules about
19   depositions.  As you can tell here, there is a
20   court reporter who is writing down what we say, and
21   even though it's normal in conversation to nod or
22   shake your head, in order for the court reporter to
23   record the testimony as accurately as possible,
24   it's important that you answer yes or no or
25   otherwise to questions.  Is that all right?
0008
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And similarly, even though in
 3   conversation, in normal conversation, people tend
 4   to kind of talk over each other, today it's
 5   important that we let one another finish talking
 6   before we respond.  So I will do my best to let you
 7   finish your testimony before I ask the next
 8   question; I would also ask that you let me finish
 9   my question before you answer.  Understand?
10        A    Yes.
11        Q    So at times your attorney may object to a
12   question today.  That does not relieve you from
13   your obligation to answer the question.  If there
14   is a question that you should not answer, your
15   attorney will instruct you not to answer the
16   question.  Does that make sense?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    If you don't understand a question,
19   please ask me, not your attorney, for more
20   explanation or for anything that you might need to
21   better understand the question.  If you do not ask
22   me to explain a question or a word or anything, I
23   will assume that you understand the question and
24   are answering it as such.  Does that make sense?
25        A    Yes.
0009
 1        Q    If you need to take a break at any point,
 2   that's all right.  Just let me know.  I'll try to
 3   take a break as regularly as possible.  I want to
 4   get you out of here before it gets dark.  So just
 5   let me know if you need a break.
 6        A    Okay.
 7        Q    I just ask that if you need to take a
 8   break, please answer a pending question before we
 9   go off the record, okay.
10        A    Okay.
11        Q    All right.  Did you do anything today to
12   prepare for today's -- excuse me.  Did you do
13   anything to prepare for today's deposition?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Okay.  So you did not meet with your
16   attorney before this deposition to talk about it?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Have you spoken with anyone else about
19   your deposition today?
20        A    No.
21        Q    And did you speak with Gayla West about
22   her deposition?
23        A    No.
24        Q    I would like to learn a little bit about
25   you.  Ms. West, where were you born?
0010
 1        A    Augusta, Georgia.
 2        Q    And when were you born?
 3        A    May 1st, 1977.
 4        Q    Okay.  So I'm bad at math.
 5        A    42.
 6        Q    All right.  Thank you.
 7             You live in Bluffton now.  When did you
 8   move to Bluffton?
 9        A    When I was three.
10        Q    I take it you don't remember Augusta,
11   Georgia?
12        A    I do.
13        Q    Okay.  Did you live in Augusta since
14   moving to Bluffton when you were three?
15        A    No.
16        Q    All right.  Your father's accident
17   occurred on November 18th, 2018, correct?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    And the location of that accident was
20   8 Myrtle Island Road in Bluffton, South Carolina,
21   right?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    And that's where your father lived at the
24   time?
25        A    Yes.
0011
 1        Q    Did he own that home?  Do you know?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    But the property was recently sold,
 4   right?
 5        A    Correct.
 6        Q    Do you know when it was sold?
 7        A    I don't know the date, no.
 8        Q    Do you have an approximation of when?
 9        A    Last week.
10        Q    Okay.  When was the property put up for
11   sale, if you know?
12        A    I don't know.
13        Q    Do you know if it was up for sale for
14   months before it sold?
15        A    I think so.  As PR -- I'm not handling
16   anything, so as not being PR, I'm not handling
17   anything in regards to any of that stuff.
18        Q    And when you say PR, what do you mean?
19        A    Personal representative of the estate.
20        Q    The house where your father lived at
21   8 Myrtle Island Road, is that the house you grew up
22   in?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Now, you told me your address at the
25   beginning of the deposition.  Was that your address
0012
 1   at the time of the accident?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    About how far away is that from your
 4   dad's house?
 5        A    One mile.
 6        Q    How long have you lived there?
 7        A    14, 15 years.
 8        Q    And do you own your home there?
 9        A    I do.
10        Q    So do you remember what year it was when
11   you moved in?  It was about, what, 2004, 2005,
12   something like that?
13        A    I mean, 13, 14 years.  It's just a guess
14   without --
15        Q    Sure.  Early 2000s, fair to say?
16        A    (Witness moves head up and down.)
17        Q    Okay.  Before you lived in the home where
18   you live now and that you own, where did you live?
19        A    50 Whispering Pine Street, Bluffton,
20   29910.
21        Q    And how far is that from where your
22   father lives?
23        A    Two-and-a-half miles.
24        Q    And how long did you live in that home,
25   or property?
0013
 1        A    For about five or six years.
 2        Q    Is that a house or an apartment?
 3        A    House.

 6        Q    Ms. West, what is your highest level of
 7   education?

11   were you doing?

14        Q    Okay.  And how long did you work there?
15        A    A year, and that was enough.

17   currently, other than the pet sitting business?

19        Q    What's the pet sitting business called?

 1   I'm not working.
 2        Q    Oh, my gosh.  You really do have my dream
 3   life.
 4        A    Yes.  I'm permitted under the state
 5   government.

10        Q    What kind of books do you like to read?

15   your family.  Are you married?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    What is your spouse's name?
18        A    James Brown.
19        Q    And how long have you been married?
20        A    12 years, I think.  I don't keep up with
21   that kind of stuff.  I'm not that kind of girl.
22        Q    How long have you been with your husband?
23        A    Probably about 15 years.
24        Q    And was James close with your husband
25   when he was alive?
0017
 1        A    With my dad?
 2        Q    Oh, my gosh.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Was James
 3   close with your dad?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Before you and your husband got together,
 6   were you married previously?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    Do you have any children?
 9        A    No.
10        Q    But you have a sister, Shellie?
11        A    Yes.
12        Q    Is she older or younger than you?
13        A    Older.
14        Q    By how much?
15        A    Nine years.
16        Q    Do you have any other siblings?
17        A    No.
18        Q    And you and Shellie, do you share both
19   parents?
20        A    Uh-huh, yes.
21        Q    Thank you.  Tell me about your mom.
22   What's her name?
23        A    Linda Ann Phillips.
24        Q    How old is she?
25        A    71.
0018
 1        Q    And where does she live?
 2        A    Knowles Island, Ridgeland.
 3        Q    What does she do?
 4        A    She's a stay-at-home housewife.
 5        Q    For how long were your parents together?
 6   Do you know?
 7        A    I don't know the amount of years based on
 8   my sister's age, but from the time she -- before
 9   she was concepted up until I was 15, so I'm not
10   quite sure of the math on that.  24 years, maybe,
11   somewhere in there.
12        Q    Sure.  And do you know if your parents
13   remained friends after they split up?
14        A    They've been amicable, yes.
15        Q    You also have an aunt, Barbara West?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    And where does she live?
18        A    Outside of Augusta.
19        Q    What does she do for a living, if you
20   know?
21        A    Currently, I think she's actually doing
22   some pet sitting, possibly, but other than that,
23   she's not -- she's been a stay-at-home wife.
24        Q    Okay.  Do you know if she has any kids?
25        A    She does.
0019
 1        Q    How many?
 2        A    She has four.
 3        Q    And how -- are her children all grown?
 4        A    Uh-huh, yes.
 5        Q    What are their names?
 6        A    Ginger, Kay, Cliff, and Gary.
 7        Q    And Cliff is Clifton Vaughan?
 8        A    Correct.
 9        Q    Do you know where he lives?
10        A    I don't.
11        Q    Do you know what he does for work?
12        A    I don't.  I don't -- I don't keep up with
13   any of their lives and like what they do for a
14   living.  We just see each other and hug and hang
15   out and that's it.
16        Q    All right.  How often do you see them?
17        A    Not often, except for Ginger.  I see
18   Ginger a lot.
19        Q    Does Ginger live here in town?
20        A    Huh-uh.  She lives in Georgia.
21        Q    Do you have any other aunts or uncles on
22   your dad's side?
23        A    No.
24        Q    Now, at the time of your father's
25   accident, he was married to Gayla Howell West,
0020
 1   right?
 2        A    Correct.
 3        Q    Do you get along well with Gayla?
 4        A    We did up until we have the litigation
 5   going on with the prenup at the moment.
 6        Q    Okay.  And that litigation, are you a
 7   party to that lawsuit?
 8        A    Well, I'm not -- I'm not personal
 9   representative, so that would be a no, because I'm
10   just an heir.
11        Q    So the litigation is the estate?
12        A    The estate versus her, yes.
13        Q    And you mentioned it's about the
14   prenuptial agreement?
15        A    Correct.
16        Q    Before that lawsuit, though, you said you
17   did get along well?
18        A    Yes.
19        Q    And in your opinion, after the lawsuit
20   was filed, kind of who started the rift, I guess?
21   Was it that she didn't want to be close -- she has
22   not been close with you since the lawsuit or you've
23   not been close with her?
24        A    It's not a rift.
25             MR. THOMAS:  Object to the form.  Yeah.
0021
 1        Go ahead.
 2             THE WITNESS:  Sorry.  Ask the question
 3        again.
 4   BY MR. CUEVAS:
 5        Q    Sure.  Why don't you describe to me your
 6   relationship with her now.
 7        A    Well, there isn't one, because with
 8   litigation, we can't speak to the opposing party.
 9        Q    All right.  Do you know when Gayla and
10   your father got married?
11        A    2016.
12        Q    Were you at the wedding?
13        A    Yes.
14        Q    Do you know who officiated their wedding?
15        A    Pastor Gwen.
16        Q    And is that a pastor that you've known
17   for some time?
18        A    I knew her a little bit before.
19        Q    Okay.  So Gayla and your father were
20   married for a little bit over two -- around two
21   years-ish when the accident happened?
22        A    Just over.
23        Q    Just over, okay.  Did you spend any time
24   with the two of them during their marriage?
25        A    Yes.
0022
 1        Q    What impression did you get of their
 2   relationship?
 3        A    I don't -- I didn't delve into that with
 4   my father.  When I'd visit my father, I'm just
 5   seeing my father, so I don't -- I don't have that
 6   kind of emotion, like I don't -- you know, so I
 7   don't know.
 8        Q    You are married, though, correct?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    And you've seen married people interact,
11   right?
12        A    Yes.
13        Q    So did you have an impression of their
14   marriage?  Not what your dad may have told you, but
15   from being with them and spending time with them,
16   what was the impression you had of their marriage?
17        A    They seemed fine.
18        Q    They seemed fine.  Did they seem happy?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    You sort of hesitated.
21        A    Well, I mean, I don't -- I don't look
22   at -- I didn't look at my father that way.  When I
23   go to visit my father, it's just I see only my
24   father, so that was -- you know, my time with him
25   was just focused on him.
0023
 1        Q    Okay.  I take it, then, your dad and you
 2   never really spoke about his marriage to Gayla?
 3        A    Not in discussing personal stuff like
 4   that.  We don't talk stuff like that, no.
 5        Q    Okay.  I want to talk a little bit more
 6   about your dad, and I know that that might be hard
 7   at times, so just take your time.
 8             How old was your dad on the day of the
 9   incident?
10        A    71.
11        Q    And what did your dad do for a living?
12        A    He was a builder.
13        Q    Did he own his own business?
14        A    He did.
15        Q    Do you know how long he's owned that
16   business?
17        A    30-plus years at least.
18        Q    Okay.  Were you a kid when he started the
19   business, as far as you know?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And what's the business called?
22        A    Randolph West Builders.
23        Q    And is that business still operating
24   today?
25        A    It could not.  He was a sole contractor,
0024
 1   so it had to cease.
 2        Q    Okay.  Tell me about your dad's work
 3   habits, if you know them.  Did he work every day?
 4        A    Absolutely.
 5        Q    And he was involved, then, I take it, in
 6   the day-to-day operations of his sites?
 7        A    Yeah.  He was sole proprietor, so yes.
 8        Q    Did your father have any other businesses
 9   that you know of?
10        A    Not businesses that worked.  He has other
11   corporations and LLCs that own different things.
12        Q    Okay.  What other corporations and LLCs
13   did he have?
14        A    He has stuff that's in like real estate
15   and capital gain investment stuff.
16        Q    Okay.  Did he own any property other than
17   the home on Myrtle Island Road that you know of?
18        A    He owns partnership commercial-type
19   properties.
20        Q    Okay.  Do you know of any residential
21   properties that he owns?
22        A    He had bought one about a month and a
23   half before his accident, and that has since been
24   sold.  That was a residential.
25        Q    Do you know how much money your dad made
0025
 1   each year?
 2        A    No, I do not.
 3        Q    Do you know who would know that
 4   information?
 5        A    I don't -- I mean, my sister probably
 6   maybe could give better ideas, because she helped
 7   him with his business.  I didn't have that type of
 8   relationship with my father.
 9        Q    What kind of relationship did you have
10   with your dad?
11        A    An awesome one.
12        Q    I'm going to ask you some questions about
13   the accident, and just take your time.  Let me know
14   if you need a break.
15             The accident occurred on the morning of
16   November 18th, 2018, right?
17        A    Correct.
18        Q    Before the accident, do you know what
19   your father was doing that day?
20        A    I don't.
21        Q    Were you present when the accident
22   happened?
23        A    I was in Asheville, North Carolina.
24        Q    So you have no personal knowledge?
25        A    I do not.
0026
 1        Q    I want to talk to you about that day.  I
 2   want to talk to you about the day of the accident,
 3   where you were.  So you were in Asheville, North
 4   Carolina?
 5        A    That's correct.
 6        Q    What were you doing in Asheville?
 7        A    Having fun.
 8        Q    What took you specifically to Asheville?
 9        A    Weekend with girlfriends from college.
10        Q    What time did you get up that day, if you
11   remember?
12        A    I was woken by the emergency phone call
13   from my sister, so I don't know.
14        Q    Do you know what time your sister called
15   you?
16        A    When my father was on fire.
17        Q    And do you have any idea what time of the
18   morning that was?
19        A    I don't know.  It was -- it was
20   definitely before 10:00 a.m., but all of that whole
21   day is a fog.
22        Q    So your sister called you that morning?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Do you know where your sister was when
25   she called?
0027
 1        A    I don't.  I can't give you a straight
 2   answer on that, where I think she may have been.
 3   That's -- I don't know.
 4        Q    Where were you when you received the
 5   call?
 6        A    Asleep.
 7        Q    But you woke up to the ring of the phone?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    And what is the first thing you remember
10   Shellie saying?  Tell me about the conversation
11   that you had with your sister.
12        A    "You need to come here right now.  Dad's
13   on fire."
14        Q    What did you say in response, as best as
15   you can recall?
16        A    Screamed, cried.  There's no way to say
17   what you said, no idea.
18        Q    Okay.  Did Shellie tell you anything else
19   when she was on the phone with you, other than,
20   "You need to come here right now, Dad's on fire"?
21        A    No.  She had to hang up and go find -- to
22   go and find out more of what was happening and then
23   to be able to call me back.
24        Q    What did you do after you got off the
25   phone with your sister?
0028
 1        A    Packed my bags.
 2        Q    Did you drive?
 3        A    I had someone drive me.
 4        Q    We'll talk about that -- about the car
 5   ride in a minute.  But you packed your bags, and
 6   you just got out of there?
 7        A    Once we knew where he was being taken.
 8   He was on the way to Memorial in Savannah.  When
 9   they discovered how bad he was burned, they
10   rerouted to the burn center in Augusta.  So as soon
11   as I knew where the helicopter was landing was when
12   we left.
13        Q    Was when you left?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    You got off the phone with your sister.
16   You packed your bags.  When did your -- when did
17   your sister next call you?
18        A    I don't -- I mean, within minutes, I
19   don't know, ten, 15 minutes, as soon as she was
20   able to tell me more.
21        Q    Okay.  And at that point on that
22   conversation, what did she tell you?
23        A    That it was bad.
24        Q    Okay.  And is that the conversation where
25   you learned where your father was being taken?
0029
 1        A    Possibly.  I was also on the phone with a
 2   lieutenant with the fire department as well,
 3   learning where he was going, so -- I mean, I was on
 4   the phone with 20 different people, one after the
 5   other, that morning.
 6        Q    So after your sister first called you and
 7   you woke up, the next thing you did, you got off
 8   the phone, you packed your bags?
 9        A    Uh-huh.
10        Q    Did you make another phone call before
11   you heard back from your sister?
12        A    I called Gayla, I called my cousin
13   Ginger, I called my best friends, I called my
14   husband.  In the order of what, I don't know.
15        Q    And that's all before Shellie called you
16   back?
17        A    Possibly, I think so.
18        Q    What did you say on the phone to Gayla?
19        A    I don't know.  She was hysterical when
20   she got on the phone, and my dad's best friends'
21   wives were there with her, so --
22        Q    And who was your dad's best friend?
23        A    His wife -- the wife that was there,
24   Robie Hester and --
25        Q    Robie?
0030
 1        A    Robie Hester.  His wife Cathy was there.
 2   My friend Joann Rieser was there.
 3        Q    And is Robie -- I'm sorry.  Is Robie your
 4   dad's best friend?
 5        A    One of them, yes.
 6        Q    And his wife was there, Cathy?
 7        A    Uh-huh.
 8        Q    And then Joann is who?
 9        A    Another neighborhood friend.
10        Q    Okay.  And did you speak with them on the
11   phone when you called Gayla?
12        A    They answered -- they answered Gayla's
13   phone, yes.
14        Q    And did -- what did they tell you about
15   the accident, if you can remember?
16        A    I don't -- I don't remember.
17        Q    Okay.  You called your husband?
18        A    Uh-huh.
19        Q    Do you remember what you spoke about with
20   your husband?
21        A    That my father was on fire.  I mean,
22   these detailed questions on what I said, I mean,
23   that's all that -- you know, conversations were all
24   that my father's on fire, I've got to get there,
25   how am I going to get there, so --
0031
 1        Q    So the next time that you heard from
 2   Shellie, you think that could have been when you
 3   heard more about your father's --
 4        A    When I knew that he was being taken to
 5   Augusta burn center.
 6        Q    And you don't believe that you learned
 7   that from the lieutenant of the fire department
 8   that you spoke with?
 9        A    Well, he went on my behalf as a friend.
10   He was not on duty that day.  When I called his
11   wife, who's my best friend, he put on his
12   lieutenant suit and went to the scene right away so
13   that he could communicate with me.
14        Q    Okay.  Who is your best friend?
15        A    Amber Hester.
16        Q    And is that Robie and Cathy's daughter?
17        A    Uh-huh.
18        Q    And Amber's husband is a lieutenant with
19   the fire department?
20        A    Uh-huh, yes.
21        Q    What's his name?
22        A    Jeff Kuehn.
23        Q    So then as far as you know, Jeff went in
24   to be able to report to you what he could?
25        A    To find out what he could as a friend.
0032
 1        Q    Sure.
 2        A    So that I didn't -- we didn't get just
 3   medical jargon and "We don't know at this point,"
 4   you know.
 5        Q    Is there anyone else that you spoke to
 6   who told you any specifics about what had happened?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    No, you didn't speak to anyone else who
 9   gave you specifics about what happened at all that
10   day or just before you heard back from your sister?
11        A    At all that day.  That was not my
12   concern.  My father's life was my only concern.
13        Q    Did you have any conversations with
14   anyone that day before you left to go to Georgia
15   that were not by phone that you can remember?  Did
16   you text anybody?
17        A    No, I mean, other than I'm on my way to
18   the burn center, no.
19        Q    Do you remember sending any emails --
20        A    It was not a text kind of day.
21        Q    Do you remember sending any emails for
22   any reason?
23        A    Not an email kind of day.
24        Q    Did you put anything on social media?
25        A    Absolutely not.
0033
 1        Q    So the next thing that you did after you
 2   learned where your father was headed, what did you
 3   do next?
 4        A    Headed there.
 5        Q    So you got in a car?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Who drove you?
 8        A    My -- one of my friends from high school.
 9        Q    And what is her name or his name?
10        A    Carrie Clark.
11        Q    About how long did it take you to get to
12   where you were headed?
13        A    It might have been a three,
14   three-and-a-half-hour drive, three-hour drive,
15   possibly, from Asheville to Augusta, Georgia.
16        Q    When you were in the car, did you have
17   any conversations with anyone in which you learned
18   more specifically about what happened?
19        A    The day of my father's accident, I
20   learned nothing specific other than he was in the
21   hospital and may not make it.
22        Q    Okay.  And after you got in the car, was
23   the burn center in Augusta the first place that you
24   went?
25        A    Absolutely.
0034
 1        Q    Did you make any stops along the way?
 2        A    Gas.
 3        Q    Do you remember whether there was bad
 4   traffic that day?
 5        A    No, no traffic.  It was a Sunday.
 6        Q    What did you and Carrie talk about in the
 7   car?
 8        A    We prayed.
 9        Q    Did you listen to music in the car?
10        A    No.
11        Q    Did you have Carrie talk to you about
12   something other than your dad when you were in the
13   car?
14        A    No, no.  I was on the phone most of the
15   time trying to get updates.
16        Q    And what kind of updates did you get?
17        A    Just that they were unwrapping and
18   putting him on morphine, and that's about it.
19        Q    And when you say "unwrapping," what do
20   you mean?
21        A    Checking to see how badly burned he was.
22   My father was 95 percent burned.
23        Q    Do you -- did you speak -- on the way to
24   the burn center, did you speak with anyone who
25   treated your father medically?
0035
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    So you didn't have any conversations with
 3   the EMS in the ambulance?
 4        A    No.
 5        Q    What about the conversations that you had
 6   with your friend's husband who's a lieutenant?  Did
 7   he --
 8        A    There was no conversations.  He just let
 9   me know that they were working on him, and they
10   were in the helicopter, and he didn't know any
11   details.
12        Q    Okay.  When you got to the burn center,
13   did you go right into -- inside, or did you need to
14   park the car first?
15        A    I was dropped off.
16        Q    And did your friend stay with you?
17        A    Uh-huh.
18        Q    When you first went inside the burn
19   center, do you remember who else that you knew was
20   there?
21        A    About 20 people greeted me to let me know
22   he wasn't going to make it.
23             MR. THOMAS:  Jesse, let's take a break.
24             MR. CUEVAS:  Yeah, let's take a break.
25             THE WITNESS:  No.  I'd rather just go,
0036
 1        please.
 2             MR. THOMAS:  You sure?
 3             THE WITNESS:  Yes.
 4   BY MR. CUEVAS:
 5        Q    Okay.  When you were in the hospital, it
 6   was the other people that were there, not a medical
 7   professional, that told you that?
 8        A    No.  I was greeted by friends, my close
 9   friends and my cousins, to let me know, to give me
10   the news, to prepare me before I went in to see
11   him.
12        Q    Do you have any idea how long people were
13   there before you got there?
14        A    That I had family members who lived in
15   Augusta, and my best -- other best friend's father
16   was there when the helicopter landed.
17        Q    Do you know if any of those people
18   specifically spoke with doctors that had treated
19   your dad?
20        A    No, they did not.
21        Q    Okay.  When -- what was the first
22   conversation that you had with a medical provider
23   at the hospital?
24        A    That it was not looking good.
25        Q    And that was after you saw your father or
0037
 1   before?
 2        A    I think it was possibly before, to
 3   prepare me.
 4        Q    Okay.  When you went in to see your dad
 5   for the first time, who was -- was anyone with you?
 6        A    I think my sister was.
 7        Q    And were you able to communicate with
 8   your dad at that point?
 9        A    My dad was -- he was basically in a
10   somewhat coma.  He could not speak.
11        Q    Okay.  He couldn't respond?
12        A    Oh, no.  He -- no.  He was -- huh-uh.  I
13   would say it was -- essentially, I guess it was
14   more of possibly a morphine coma.  But no, he
15   was -- he was --
16        Q    He was not conscious, as far as you know?
17        A    No.  We were only talking to him as if he
18   was a coma patient.
19        Q    Okay.  After that, did you speak with any
20   medical professionals at the hospital?
21        A    Spoke to the doctors the whole entire
22   time we were there.
23        Q    And did the doctors at any point tell you
24   anything about what happened during the accident?
25        A    No.
0038
 1        Q    They didn't tell you what your dad was
 2   doing when the accident occurred?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    They didn't tell you what caused the
 5   accident?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Did they tell you anything that your
 8   father had told to them about the accident?
 9        A    My father could not -- beyond the
10   helicopter landing, my father was not speaking
11   anymore.  It was only at the onset of the accident
12   when my father was still speaking somewhat, and
13   then once he arrived, he was not speaking anymore.
14        Q    And who told you that information?
15        A    I know he wasn't.
16        Q    You just know?
17        A    Uh-huh.
18        Q    Okay.  No one told you he was speaking --
19        A    He was not speaking -- once he arrived at
20   the hospital, he was no longer coherent.  They were
21   giving him drugs to stop the massive pain he was
22   in.
23        Q    So the knowledge that you have of when he
24   was coherent early on after the accident, where did
25   that knowledge come from?
0039
 1        A    Well, one of our neighbors said my father
 2   was screaming, "Why can't I see?"
 3        Q    And which neighbor told you that?
 4        A    There's three or four neighbors that were
 5   on the scene, so I'm not sure which one specific.
 6        Q    Which -- what are the names of the
 7   neighbors that were on the scene, if you know?
 8        A    Jim Odum's the only name --
 9        Q    That you know?
10        A    Yeah.  There was a stranger neighbor down
11   the road.  I don't know who he is.
12        Q    And Jim Odum is the next-door neighbor to
13   your dad?
14        A    Uh-huh, uh-huh.
15        Q    Yes?
16        A    Uh-huh, yes.
17        Q    Tom Vezzosi, is that possibly the
18   neighbor that lives --
19        A    Maybe.
20        Q    -- down the road?
21        A    I don't know them.
22        Q    But you had a conversation with Jim?
23        A    I did not have a conversation, no.  That
24   was just hearsay of hearing that my father was
25   screaming.
0040
 1        Q    Okay.  And when you say it's just
 2   hearsay, do you know who told you that Jim said or
 3   a neighborhood said this?
 4        A    I don't.  When you're dealing with
 5   something as traumatic as this, you don't -- you
 6   don't remember stuff like that, and you don't think
 7   to care, because it's just all about your father,
 8   and that stuff doesn't matter.
 9        Q    How long were you at the hospital that
10   day?
11        A    Until he passed.
12        Q    And do you know when that was or how long
13   you had been there?
14        A    Roughly around 7:30 at night or so.
15        Q    Do you remember what time or so it was
16   when you arrived?
17        A    I don't.
18        Q    Do you remember any specifics of about
19   what doctors told you when you were speaking to
20   them at the hospital?
21        A    I mean, the last conversation was when we
22   found out that all of his internal organs were
23   failing.
24        Q    And were you surrounded by all of your
25   family when you had that conversation?
0041
 1        A    Not -- I mean, not all, probably
 2   surrounded by 15, 20 people that were there.
 3        Q    So when you were getting reports from
 4   doctors, it wasn't just to you?
 5        A    Some of them were just us.  At the end,
 6   when it was coming down to my father's organs were
 7   failing, we let everybody hear what was happening
 8   because it was important.
 9        Q    And when you say, "Just us," do you
10   mean -- who do you mean?
11        A    My sister, Gayla, my Aunt Barbara.
12        Q    And was your husband also at the
13   hospital?
14        A    No, he was not.
15        Q    Do you remember if Shellie's husband was
16   at the hospital?
17        A    He was not.  They both arrived after my
18   father had already passed.
19        Q    Shellie and --
20        A    My husband and her husband both arrived
21   after my father had already passed.  They were
22   both -- my husband was working, and her husband was
23   out of town.
24        Q    Do you remember the names of any of your
25   dad's doctors that you spoke to?
0042
 1        A    I don't.
 2        Q    Does a Dr. Mullins sound like someone you
 3   spoke to?
 4        A    I have no idea any of the names.  I
 5   didn't ask because that was insignificant.
 6        Q    How many different people did you speak
 7   with at the hospital that treated him, if you know?
 8        A    I can recall I think there was one main
 9   doctor.  There could have been two.  I don't see
10   that when your father is possibly dying.
11        Q    And when did you leave the hospital that
12   night?
13        A    We probably left anywhere from 8:00 to
14   9:00.
15        Q    Not too much longer after your dad had
16   passed?
17        A    Right.
18        Q    Were you involved in -- strike that.
19             Was there a time when you were in the
20   hospital with your family and friends when there
21   was a possibility that your dad would make it?
22        A    No.
23        Q    So from the time you got there, it was
24   known that he was not going to make it?
25        A    Correct.
0043
 1        Q    When was it that you first learned about
 2   the accident in terms of what happened at the house
 3   when the accident occurred?
 4        A    Could have been a couple days after.
 5        Q    Couple days after.  And who told you what
 6   happened?
 7        A    I don't recall.
 8        Q    You can't think of the person who told
 9   you what happened to your dad?
10        A    I don't recall.  I mean, I think my
11   sister found out about the gas can, that the gas
12   can was sitting off to the side, and so it was
13   probably a couple days after, so possibly Shellie.
14        Q    Maybe Shellie.  Do you know how she
15   learned that information?
16        A    I don't.
17        Q    Where was the first place you went after
18   the hospital?
19        A    Home.
20        Q    To your home?
21        A    Uh-huh, yes.
22        Q    And you said that at some point maybe a
23   couple days later, you learned that there was a gas
24   can that was in the yard?
25        A    Yes.
0044
 1        Q    Did you personally ever see a gas can in
 2   the yard?
 3        A    I did not.  Everything was gone.
 4   Everything was cleaned up and gone by the time we
 5   got home, out of respect for my sister and I, so
 6   that we didn't have to see.
 7        Q    And when you say "home," you mean your
 8   dad's house?
 9        A    Yes, correct.
10        Q    But after the hospital, you went to your
11   house?
12        A    Correct.
13        Q    Do you know who cleaned up the yard?
14        A    I don't, I don't.
15        Q    And you don't know when they cleaned it
16   up?
17        A    I don't.
18        Q    But it was -- when was the first time
19   that you went to your dad's house after the
20   accident?
21        A    Monday.
22        Q    So the next day?
23        A    Correct.  And I stayed away from the
24   backyard where the scene happened.
25        Q    But by the time you got to the house on
0045
 1   Monday, the backyard, as far as you know, had been
 2   cleaned up?
 3        A    They had picked up my father's shoe, his
 4   clothes.  Everything was picked up so that my
 5   sister and I didn't have to witness that.
 6        Q    When was the first time that you went
 7   into the backyard after the accident?
 8        A    Probably over a month.
 9        Q    And at that time, did you see or inspect
10   the area where the accident occurred?
11        A    I just looked at the -- at the area and
12   cried.  I mean, there was nothing there to look at,
13   other than to envision what my father went through.
14        Q    Did you -- when you say you looked at the
15   area, did you look at the area around where the
16   burn pile was?
17        A    I wasn't looking for something.  I was
18   looking and envisioning what my father went
19   through.
20        Q    And who were you with at that moment?
21        A    Probably by myself.
22        Q    So you don't remember that you were with
23   Shellie the first time you really looked in the
24   backyard?
25        A    I don't recall it.  I don't think so.
0046
 1        Q    Who is it that told you about the gas
 2   can's involvement in your dad's accident?
 3        A    It was most likely my sister Shellie.
 4        Q    And you don't remember when that was?
 5        A    It was within that week of my father's
 6   accident.
 7        Q    Did you ever learn specifics about where
 8   the accident happened, where in the yard your
 9   father was?
10        A    I mean, I just knew that he was in the
11   backyard.
12        Q    Okay.  So you didn't -- if I were to show
13   you a map, for example, of your backyard --
14        A    I can't tell you where he was standing.
15   I can't tell you where he was -- where he was, no.
16        Q    Okay.  You wouldn't be able to tell me
17   where the gas can was?
18        A    No.  And I can tell you I have not asked
19   any questions about what happened.  I have not
20   gotten any accounts of what happened.  I haven't
21   read any of the documents from the EMT, the fire
22   department, because I can't handle that stuff.
23        Q    Okay.  So if I have any questions at all
24   about any specifics of this accident, you are not
25   the person to ask?
0047
 1        A    That's correct.
 2        Q    Do you know who I should ask those
 3   questions to, other than the ambulance, EMS people,
 4   or first responders who were there?
 5        A    The neighbors and Gayla were the only
 6   ones that were on the scene, that were there.
 7        Q    Do you know if at any point Shellie
 8   arrived at your father's house on the day of the
 9   accident?
10        A    I can't say at what point she arrived.  I
11   think she arrived after he had already been lifted,
12   but I'm not -- I'm not sure.  Those are all just
13   details that they don't matter.
14        Q    And you have not asked her about that?
15        A    It's not important.
16        Q    So the answer is no?
17        A    That's correct.
18        Q    Have you ever inspected the area of where
19   the accident occurred?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Now, the house has been sold?
22        A    Correct.
23        Q    And it was up for sale for a number of
24   months before the sale.  Were you at all involved
25   in getting the house sell ready?
0048
 1        A    No.
 2        Q    Do you know who was?
 3        A    My sister is the only one that's handling
 4   the estate.
 5        Q    And that includes the sale of the house?
 6        A    Correct.
 7        Q    Okay.  So you didn't clean up the
 8   property at all or --
 9        A    I mean, we did a yard sale and removed
10   furniture, but --
11        Q    So you removed furniture from inside the
12   house?
13        A    Correct.
14        Q    And did you at all go into the structure
15   in the backyard to remove anything from --
16        A    Yeah.  I mean, we had to clean everything
17   out:  My dad's shed, the garage, everything.
18        Q    So were you personally involved in
19   cleaning out the shed and the garage?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    But just to be clear, you have not read
22   any EMS reports?
23        A    That's correct.
24        Q    And you haven't read any medical reports?
25        A    Correct.
0049
 1        Q    Or any fire department reports?
 2        A    Correct.
 3        Q    Or any sheriff's office reports?
 4        A    That's correct.
 5        Q    So you have no personal knowledge about
 6   what happened the day of?
 7        A    No.  I have not even heard Gayla's
 8   account of what happened.
 9        Q    And Shellie has not told you what she
10   understands happened, if anything?
11        A    No.
12        Q    I want to talk to you about the gas can
13   that your dad was using during the incident.  Do
14   you know what kind of gas can it was?
15        A    I knew -- I found out after, after the
16   fire.
17        Q    And what kind of a gas can is it?
18        A    The Blitz.
19        Q    So Blitz is the manufacturer?
20        A    Correct.
21        Q    Where did you learn that?
22        A    After they had found the can and seen
23   that it looked like something awry with the can.
24        Q    And when you say "they," you don't know
25   who?
0050
 1        A    Yeah, just the neighbors that were --
 2   that had helped dad.
 3        Q    So it's the neighbors that picked up the
 4   can, inspected the can, and told you that
 5   something -- there was something about the can?
 6        A    One of our neighbors had seen the can and
 7   felt something was awry with it based on how it
 8   exploded.
 9        Q    And that neighbor is which one?
10        A    I think it was Carlus, Carlus Schultz.
11        Q    Carla Schultz?  So it's not Jim Odum?
12        A    Huh-uh.
13        Q    Jim never told you anything about the
14   can?
15        A    No.  Jim will not talk to me about the
16   accident because he can't right now.
17        Q    So you know that it's a
18   Blitz-manufactured can?
19        A    Correct.
20             MR. CUEVAS:  I am introducing what has
21        previously been marked as Exhibit 5.  This is
22        a photo.
23             MR. THOMAS:  Jesse, I've got to put
24        something on the record.
25             MR. CUEVAS:  All right.
0051
 1             MR. THOMAS:  And I know you're not asking
 2        this, but Leigh, to the extent that if she
 3        asks you a question and it's something you
 4        learned from me or a conversation with one of
 5        the lawyers, let her know, because I just want
 6        to make sure I retain the privilege.  She's
 7        not asking for that, but --
 8             THE WITNESS:  Okay.
 9   BY MR. CUEVAS:
10        Q    Yeah.  What your counsel said is exactly
11   right.  I don't need to know or want to know what
12   communications you have had with your attorneys,
13   and if I am asking you a question that gets close
14   to that or if you have to disclose communications
15   that you have had with your attorney in order to
16   answer the question, just let me know, and we'll
17   move off.
18             MR. AKINS:  You really don't want to
19        know?  I'm sure you're a little curious,
20        aren't you?
21             MR. CUEVAS:  Nah.
22             MR. AKINS:  All right.
23   BY MR. CUEVAS:
24        Q    If you'd take a look at this picture.  Is
25   this a picture of the gasoline container that you
0052
 1   understand was involved in your father's accident?
 2        A    I never saw it, so --
 3        Q    You've never seen the can?
 4        A    No.  I've never even seen this photo.
 5        Q    Okay.  Do you know what happened to the
 6   can after the accident?
 7        A    I don't.
 8        Q    Do you know who retrieved it?
 9        A    I don't.
10        Q    Did you know that it was put in a trash
11   bag at one point?
12        A    I don't.  I didn't worry about any of
13   those details.
14        Q    And you -- have you ever held the can?
15        A    No.
16        Q    You've never seen the can?
17        A    No.
18        Q    Okay.  Do you know who purchased the can
19   that was involved in your dad's accident?
20        A    I mean, my father's going to have
21   purchased it because it's his, so --
22        Q    So your understanding is that your dad
23   purchased the can?
24        A    Correct.
25        Q    And tell me everything that you know that
0053
 1   leads you to that belief.
 2        A    I mean, it's a gas can.  We've always had
 3   gas cans.  He's got lawn mowers, boats.
 4        Q    Just so --
 5        A    So he always has gas cans on his
 6   property.
 7        Q    And because he has them, your conclusion
 8   is that he purchased them?
 9        A    Yes.
10        Q    Do you know when he bought this specific
11   gas can?
12        A    I don't.
13        Q    Do you know where he purchased the can?
14        A    Walmart.
15        Q    Do you know which one?
16        A    Most likely it would be -- based on the
17   year, it'd have to be the one on Hilton Head.
18        Q    And when you say, "Based on the year,"
19   what year is that?
20        A    I think it was before -- it was before
21   2010 or so.
22        Q    Before 2010.  So you understand that the
23   can was purchased at the Walmart in Hilton Head
24   because of the can's age?
25        A    Uh-huh.
0054
 1        Q    And you don't know when he purchased the
 2   can, correct?
 3        A    I don't.
 4        Q    Okay.  But you know the can's age?
 5        A    I think it was before 2010 is what my
 6   sister told me.
 7        Q    So the next question I was going to ask
 8   you is how did you learn about the can.
 9        A    Yeah.
10        Q    So all of your knowledge about the can
11   comes from your sister.  Is that right?
12        A    Not all of it, no.
13        Q    Okay.  But the can's -- when it was made,
14   being made before 2010 is something your sister
15   told you?
16        A    Yes.
17        Q    Okay.  Do you know if your dad shopped
18   anywhere other than Walmart for gas cans?
19        A    Not that I know of.
20        Q    But you said that he always had gas cans
21   at the house, right?
22        A    Yeah, because we had boats, lawn mowers.
23        Q    Do you know if your dad ever bought a gas
24   can from a Lowe's?
25        A    Not that I know of.
0055
 1        Q    Do you know if he ever bought a gas can
 2   from Home Depot?
 3        A    Not that I know of.
 4        Q    Do you know any place other than Walmart
 5   where he's ever purchased a gas can?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    And what is your understanding -- excuse
 8   me.
 9             What is the basis of your knowledge for
10   why the cans were purchased at Walmart?
11        A    What was his purpose of purchasing a gas
12   can?
13        Q    No.  What is the base of your knowledge
14   that he purchased gas cans at Walmart?
15        A    That's because where he always got his
16   boat stuff.
17        Q    He would go to Walmart to get his boat
18   stuff?
19        A    Uh-huh.
20        Q    Yes?
21        A    Yes.
22        Q    Okay.  Now, in addition to the gas can
23   that was involved in the incident, you've said that
24   there were other gas cans that he's always had on
25   the property.  Do you know if, on the day of the
0056
 1   incident, that he had other gas cans?
 2        A    I don't know.
 3        Q    Okay.  But you have seen other gas cans
 4   at the house?
 5        A    Yes.
 6        Q    Did you ever use any of your dad's gas
 7   cans?
 8        A    Oh, I'm sure.  We're family, you know,
 9   gassed my boat up in his driveway.
10        Q    So did you ever refill the gas can?
11        A    No.
12        Q    So did you ever see your dad refill a gas
13   can?
14        A    No.
15        Q    You just know that they got filled?
16        A    Yeah.
17        Q    Do you know if your dad filled --
18   refilled gas cans at a gas station?
19        A    I don't know where.
20        Q    Do you know where your dad stored the gas
21   cans that he had?
22        A    I don't.
23        Q    Do you know if they were outside or
24   inside?
25        A    I don't.
0057
 1        Q    But you saw them?
 2        A    Yeah, I mean, go over there, and he'd
 3   bring a gas can out for me to gas my boat up.
 4        Q    Okay.  And your dad would always gas your
 5   boat up?
 6        A    Uh-huh.
 7        Q    Do you know where he went to retrieve the
 8   gas can?
 9        A    Huh-uh.
10        Q    No?
11        A    Huh-uh.  I mean, I don't pay attention, I
12   mean, no.
13        Q    Okay.  Did you see gas cans on his
14   property personally?
15        A    40 -- for 40 years, yeah.
16        Q    Okay.  And before the accident, when was
17   the last time that you saw a gas can at the house?
18        A    I don't know.
19        Q    When was the last time that you remember
20   being at your dad's house before the accident?
21        A    I was at his house three days prior.
22        Q    Okay.  And did you see any gas cans on
23   that occasion?
24        A    No.  I was bringing him chicken eggs.
25        Q    Do you know if your dad stored the gas
0058
 1   can that was involved in his accident in the same
 2   place that he stored the other gas cans?
 3        A    I have no idea.
 4        Q    So if I were to ask you any questions
 5   about where his gas cans were sold -- stored and
 6   whether they were all stored in the same place, you
 7   would not have any idea?
 8        A    No.
 9             MR. CUEVAS:  I am introducing as
10        Exhibit 6 a photograph that has been
11        previously marked as Exhibit 6, and it is --
12        it falls on Page 74 of the Durig photos.
13             Would you guys like a copy?
14             MR. THOMAS:  No.  We have one.  Thank
15        you.
16   BY MR. CUEVAS:
17        Q    Do you see that there are five gas cans
18   in this photo?
19        A    Uh-huh, yes.
20             MR. CUEVAS:  I am also going to introduce
21        what has previously been marked as Exhibit 7,
22        and this falls at page 77 of the Durig photos,
23        for the record.
24   BY MR. CUEVAS:
25        Q    And you see here that there is a
0059
 1   different gas can in the photo that is Exhibit 7?
 2        A    Yes.
 3        Q    And if you look at these two photos
 4   together, would you agree with me that the gas can
 5   that's in Exhibit 7, which is the single can, is
 6   different from the gas can -- gas cans -- that are
 7   in Exhibit 6?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    Now, if you look at Exhibit 7, you agree
10   that it's an orange gas can?
11        A    Appears to be.
12        Q    Okay.  And if you look at Exhibit 6,
13   which has the five gas cans, and you can feel free
14   to move them or touch them or however so that you
15   can better see them, do you know if the picture was
16   taken of these gas cans in the location where they
17   were stored on the property?
18        A    I don't know.
19        Q    Would you agree that it appears that
20   they're all sort of lined up against looks like a
21   siding of a structure?
22        A    Yes.
23        Q    And does that appear to you like the
24   siding of the structure at the end of your dad's
25   driveway?
0060
 1        A    Yes.
 2        Q    And if you look at Exhibit 6, which has
 3   the five cans, if you look at the can on the far
 4   left, would you agree with me that the can appears
 5   to be labeled "Kerosene"?  Looks like it's
 6   handwritten, maybe there's some dripping.
 7        A    Possibly.
 8        Q    Okay.  And you would agree with me that
 9   in Exhibit 5 -- excuse me, seven -- which is the
10   single gas can, that the gas can is labeled, looks
11   like it's handwritten, with the word "Diesel"?
12        A    Correct.
13        Q    I am going to call the gas can that is on
14   the far left of the exhibit with the five gas cans
15   in it the kerosene can, okay.
16        A    Okay.
17        Q    And I'm going to call Exhibit 7, the gas
18   can that's labeled "Diesel," the diesel can, okay.
19        A    Okay.
20        Q    Do you know whether your dad stored only
21   kerosene in the kerosene can?
22        A    I don't know.
23        Q    Do you know what fuels he stored in any
24   of these cans?
25        A    I don't.
0061
 1        Q    Do you know if he stored diesel in the
 2   diesel can?
 3        A    I don't.
 4        Q    Do you know where the diesel can was
 5   stored on the property?
 6        A    No.
 7        Q    Okay.  If I wanted to ask you any
 8   questions about how he stores these cans, would you
 9   be able to answer any of those questions?
10        A    No.  It's just not something you pay
11   attention to when you're with your father.
12        Q    Now, you and your dad -- you have a boat?
13        A    Correct.
14        Q    And your dad has a boat?
15        A    He did.
16        Q    I understand that he was an avid boater?
17        A    Correct.
18        Q    Did the two of you ever boat out
19   together?
20        A    Yes.
21        Q    And did you ever watch him fill up a boat
22   with a gas can?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Do you know which of these gas cans
25   you've ever seen him --
0062
 1        A    I don't.
 2        Q    Okay.  Do you know -- do you recall
 3   anything about the gas cans that you have seen your
 4   dad refill a boat with?
 5        A    No.
 6        Q    You don't remember if they were red or
 7   orange or yellow?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    You don't remember if they had a spout or
10   not?
11        A    Well, they all have a spout.
12        Q    So then when you saw him pour gas into a
13   boat to refill it, do you know if he pulled a spout
14   out?
15        A    I don't.
16        Q    Okay.  And if I were to ask you any
17   specifics about these cans, for example, do any of
18   them have a screen, would you be able to answer
19   that?
20        A    No.
21        Q    Do you know where your dad purchased the
22   gas can that's on the far left in Exhibit 6, the
23   kerosene can?
24        A    I don't.
25        Q    Do you know that he purchased the can?
0063
 1        A    He purchased all of his cans, so --
 2        Q    And that's because he owned them?
 3        A    Right.
 4        Q    Do you know if he purchased the kerosene
 5   can at Walmart?
 6        A    I'm sure he did.  He purchased all of his
 7   cans at Walmart, any boat bumpers at Walmart, gas
 8   cans at Walmart, oil at Walmart.
 9        Q    So if I walked through every single one
10   of these cans and asked you did he buy this can at
11   Walmart --
12        A    I would assume, yes.
13        Q    That he purchased all of these gas cans
14   at Walmart?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    And do you believe it was the Walmart in
17   Hilton Head?
18        A    I don't know.  I'm speculating, you know,
19   that the Walmart on Hilton Head was the first and
20   only Walmart we had in this area.
21        Q    Did you ever go to any other Walmarts
22   with your dad in the area?
23        A    Yes.
24        Q    Did he buy boating supplies --
25        A    Yes.
0064
 1        Q    -- at any other Walmarts in the area
 2   other than the Hilton Head Walmart?
 3        A    Yes.
 4        Q    Which Walmarts were those?
 5        A    A later date, probably two years ago, we
 6   went to the Walmart here in Bluffton to purchase
 7   boat supplies.
 8        Q    So he went to the Bluffton Walmart?
 9        A    Uh-huh.
10        Q    He went to the Hilton Head Walmart?
11        A    Uh-huh.
12        Q    Is there any other Walmart that you know
13   that your dad frequented?
14        A    I can't say without being in his person
15   and his head knowing.
16        Q    Well, when you were with him, have you
17   ever been with him when he frequented a Walmart --
18        A    No.
19        Q    -- to purchase boat supplies?
20        A    If my father and I went to the store
21   together, it was a one-off occasion.
22        Q    Okay.  But you did go to the Hilton Head
23   and Bluffton Walmarts with him to buy boat
24   supplies?
25        A    Once.
0065
 1        Q    Okay.  Have you ever been with your dad
 2   at a Walmart in Hardeeville?
 3        A    I've only been to Walmart with my father
 4   once, so --
 5        Q    And was that the Hilton Head and the
 6   Bluffton locations?
 7        A    It was the Bluffton one here.
 8        Q    It was the Bluffton one?
 9        A    Just a couple years ago.  Other than
10   that, I did not go to stores with my father.
11        Q    Because he didn't like to go on shopping
12   trips?
13        A    No.  I fished with my father; I did not
14   shop with my father.
15        Q    Do you know what uses your father had
16   with diesel?  Like what did he use diesel for?
17        A    No, I have no idea.
18        Q    Do you know what he used kerosene for?
19        A    No.
20        Q    Do you know if he had kerosene on the
21   property?
22        A    I don't know for sure, no.
23        Q    And gasoline, do you know what he used
24   gas for?
25        A    Lawn mowers, boats.
0066
 1        Q    Always refueling a piece of equipment?
 2        A    Correct.
 3        Q    Do you know if he used diesel fuel in
 4   heaters on the property?
 5        A    I don't know.
 6        Q    Can you think of any other use that your
 7   dad had for gasoline, other than to refill boats
 8   and lawn mowers or other equipment?
 9        A    No, not that I know of.
10        Q    Do you know of any uses that your father
11   had for kerosene on the property that you can think
12   of at all?
13        A    No.
14        Q    And any uses for diesel that you can
15   think of that your dad had?
16        A    No.
17        Q    Do you know if your dad ever used the
18   same container to hold gas and another substance?
19        A    I can't say.  My father was intelligent,
20   so he never would have mixed --
21        Q    He never would have mixed fuel?
22        A    Not to my knowledge, he would never have
23   mixed anything.  My father was very cautious, very
24   particular.
25        Q    Do you know what happened to the gas can
0067
 1   that's on the far left of Exhibit 6, the one with
 2   the five photos in it?
 3        A    No, I don't.
 4        Q    You were involved in cleaning out
 5   things --
 6        A    No, I did not.
 7        Q    -- on the property?
 8        A    I did not handle anything that was in
 9   relation to my father's accident.  So gas cans were
10   taken, I did not deal with any of that, so --
11        Q    Do you know who handled the gas cans?
12        A    I don't, I don't.
13        Q    Do you know if the gas cans are still on
14   the property?
15        A    Everything is gone, house has been sold,
16   so there's nothing left of my father or my family
17   there.
18        Q    So if there's anything at the property
19   currently, it's the new owner's?
20        A    Correct.
21        Q    When was the last time that you were on
22   the property?
23        A    Probably a couple weeks ago.
24        Q    And at that time, was it empty?
25        A    Oh, yes.  It's been empty for quite some
0068
 1   months now.
 2        Q    Okay.  So when the house was sell ready
 3   and up for sale, it was empty?
 4        A    Yes.
 5        Q    Including the shed?
 6        A    Yes.
 7        Q    Or the area in the back?
 8        A    Yes.
 9        Q    But you don't know who got rid of the
10   cans?
11        A    No.
12        Q    I think I know the answer to this
13   question, but I'm going to ask anyway.  Before your
14   dad's accident, do you know when the last time was
15   that you saw the gas can that was actually involved
16   in the accident?
17        A    I don't.
18        Q    Do you know what kind of fuel was inside
19   the can at the time --
20        A    I don't.
21        Q    -- of the accident?
22        A    No.
23        Q    Your dad had a burn pile in the backyard,
24   right?
25        A    Yes.
0069
 1        Q    And he -- did he light fires in the burn
 2   pile often?  Do you know?
 3        A    I don't know.
 4        Q    Do you know how often he started fires in
 5   the yard?
 6        A    I don't know.
 7        Q    Do you know how often he lit the burn
 8   pile?
 9        A    I don't know.
10        Q    When you were on the property since the
11   accident helping to clean up and get everything out
12   of the house and the shed, did you ever light a
13   fire in the burn pile?
14        A    No.
15        Q    Did you ever see anybody else do it?
16        A    No.
17        Q    So as far as you know from your own
18   personal knowledge, no one lit a fire in the burn
19   pile in the backyard since the accident?
20        A    I don't know of any -- I don't know of
21   any piles that have been burned since my father's
22   accident.
23        Q    Do you know if he always burned things in
24   the burn pile in the backyard or if he burned
25   fires -- lit fires anywhere else on the property
0070
 1   other than a fireplace?
 2        A    I don't know.
 3        Q    Have you ever seen your dad use an
 4   accelerant to light a fire?
 5        A    Define "accelerant."
 6        Q    A fuel source.
 7        A    Not fuel.  I mean, I think he's used the
 8   lighter fluid.
 9        Q    You've seen him use lighter fluid before?
10        A    And kerosene, possibly.
11        Q    So you've maybe seen him use kerosene?
12        A    Uh-huh.
13        Q    Have you seen him use diesel?
14        A    I don't know, not that -- not that -- I
15   can't recall.
16        Q    Do you know why your dad would use
17   lighter fluid or kerosene to light a fire, as
18   opposed to a fuel?
19        A    He wouldn't ever use fuel on a fire.
20        Q    Why not?
21        A    Because he's smart.
22        Q    So using fuel to light a fire is
23   dangerous?
24        A    Right.  My father would never ever use
25   gasoline to start a fire.
0071
 1        Q    Do you know why he used lighter fluid or
 2   kerosene to light a fire?
 3        A    It would just be if he couldn't get a
 4   flame going, just like you put fat lighter on a
 5   fire, you put something dry on it.
 6        Q    When you saw your dad light fires, other
 7   than when he used an accelerant, a fluid of sorts
 8   to light a fire, how did you see him light fires?
 9        A    With fat lighter.
10        Q    Describe a fat lighter to me.
11        A    It's a piece of wood.
12        Q    Did you ever see your dad use a lighter
13   to light a fire?
14        A    Yes.
15        Q    Did you ever see your dad use a match to
16   light a fire?
17        A    Yes.
18        Q    Did you ever see him use a lighter or a
19   match to light the burn pile, to start a fire in
20   the burn pile?
21        A    I was never with him when he -- when he
22   lit a burn pile.  I was only with him when he lit
23   fireplace fires.
24        Q    Were you ever with him on a camping trip,
25   and he lit a fire?
0072
 1        A    Yeah, probably about 20 years ago.
 2        Q    And at that time, you don't recall him
 3   using lighter fluid or kerosene?
 4        A    I don't recall a trip like that, no.
 5             MR. CUEVAS:  I am introducing what has
 6        previously been marked as Exhibit 4, and for
 7        the record, this is from Page 79 of the Durig
 8        photos.
 9             Would you guys like a copy?
10             MR. THOMAS:  Got one.
11   BY MR. CUEVAS:
12        Q    Have you ever seen -- strike that.
13             Would you agree with me that this appears
14   to be a photograph of a lighter?
15        A    Correct.
16        Q    And does this look like a lighter resting
17   in an area of the detached structure that's at the
18   end of your dad's driveway?
19        A    Yes.
20        Q    Do you know if this is where that lighter
21   usually was kept?
22        A    I have no idea.
23        Q    Did you ever see your dad light a fire
24   with this lighter?
25        A    No.
0073
 1        Q    And you never saw him light the burn pile
 2   in the backyard?
 3        A    No.
 4        Q    Do you know what kinds of debris your dad
 5   would burn in the burn pile?
 6        A    I can't say what he was -- you know, I
 7   don't know.  I didn't have him go through a spiel
 8   of what all he would burn.
 9        Q    In talking to your dad or talking to
10   Gayla, did you ever come to learn what kinds of
11   debris he would --
12        A    No.
13        Q    -- burn in the backyard?
14        A    I never asked, no.
15        Q    Do you know if he was burning sticks?
16        A    I have no idea.
17        Q    You never saw the burn pile?
18        A    I did not examine the burn pile.
19        Q    Okay.  So you could not testify one way
20   or the other as to the contents of the burn pile?
21        A    From the day of his accident?  No.
22        Q    What about before the accident?
23        A    I mean, it could have leaves on there,
24   sticks.
25        Q    Leaves and sticks?
0074
 1        A    Yeah.
 2        Q    Did you see any other kind of wood or
 3   construction material?
 4        A    Huh-uh, no.
 5        Q    Have you ever seen any glass bottles or
 6   aluminum in the burn pile?
 7        A    No.
 8        Q    After the accident, when you learned
 9   through a neighbor that a gas can was involved in
10   the accident, did you come to learn what happened
11   in the accident?
12        A    No.
13        Q    So you don't know if he was lighting a
14   fire when the accident occurred?
15        A    I don't know any details.  All I know is
16   that there was an explosion, and he was on fire.
17        Q    Your sister is the personal
18   representative of your father's estate, correct?
19        A    Correct.
20        Q    And she has brought a lawsuit as the
21   personal representative against Walmart.  Do you
22   know that?
23        A    Correct, yes.
24        Q    Do you know when your family decided to
25   file a lawsuit?
0075
 1        A    I don't.
 2        Q    Do you know whether -- and again, I don't
 3   want to know what you've spoken about with your
 4   attorneys.  Do you know whether your family
 5   contacted an attorney or an attorney contacted you?
 6        A    We contacted an attorney, as far as I
 7   know, but I can't -- I'm not PR, so --
 8        Q    As you sit here today, what exactly do
 9   you believe caused the explosion?
10        A    I don't know.
11        Q    Do you know that in addition to the
12   estate's claim in this lawsuit, there is a claim
13   asserted against Walmart on your behalf as a
14   beneficiary of the estate?
15        A    Yes.
16        Q    Do you know what you're asserting a claim
17   for?
18        A    I'm letting my sister handle everything.
19        Q    Do you know at all what kind of losses or
20   damages you are alleging -- your sister, as the
21   plaintiff and the personal representative of the
22   estate, is alleging in this case?
23        A    I'm letting the attorneys handle all
24   that.
25        Q    So can you tell me the basis of any
0076
 1   damages?
 2        A    I cannot.
 3        Q    You have no idea what the grounds are?
 4        A    I do not.
 5        Q    Did you know that there is a ground or a
 6   category of damages that is being asserted for the
 7   loss of pecuniary benefit?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    Were you financially dependent on your
10   dad?
11        A    No.
12             MR. CUEVAS:  Let's take a break.
13             MR. THOMAS:  Sure.
14             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the end of
15        Media Number 1 in the deposition of Leigh
16        West.  We are off the record at 4:36 p.m.
17                  (A recess transpired.)
18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is the beginning
19        of Media Number 2 in the deposition of Leigh
20        West.  We are on the record at 4:46 p.m.
21   BY MR. CUEVAS:
22        Q    Ms. West, I only have a few more
23   questions.
24             Just so that I know, the gas can that was
25   involved in your father's accident, you were not
0077
 1   with him when he purchased that can, correct?
 2        A    Correct.
 3        Q    And you don't know specifically where he
 4   purchased that can?
 5        A    I can't say for sure, no.
 6        Q    And you don't know for certain when he
 7   bought the can?
 8        A    No.
 9        Q    But your assumption is that he purchased
10   it at Walmart because that's where he bought a lot
11   of his boating equipment, and it was before 2010?
12        A    And his gas cans, yes.
13        Q    And because that's where he bought all
14   his other gas cans?
15        A    Correct.
16        Q    Okay.  Do you know if your sister was
17   financially dependent on your dad?
18        A    I can't -- I don't know.
19             MR. CUEVAS:  Okay.  I have no further
20        questions.
21             MR. THOMAS:  I don't have any questions
22        either.  Thank you.
23             MR. CUEVAS:  Thank you very much.
24             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This concludes the

0078
 1        record at 4:47 p.m., Media Number 2.

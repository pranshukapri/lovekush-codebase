 4              MR. KENNY:  All right.  Folks on the phone, we
 5         are going to get started here.  If I could just
 6         remind everyone, if you could mute your phones,
 7         that would be appreciated.
 8                      LAWRENCE T. DONOVAN,
 9    having been first duly sworn, was examined and testified
10    upon his oath as follows:
11              THE WITNESS:  I do.
12              MR. KENNY:  Okay.  Before we get started,
13         Mr. Donovan, we are just going to do a few
14         stipulations on the record.  All objections except
15         objection to form and motion to strike reserved
16         until trial?
17              MR. HUMEN:  Agree.
18              MR. KENNY:  Would you like Mr. Donovan to read
19         and sign?
20              MR. HUMEN:  You'll have the option to read the
21         deposition afterwards, and if you want to make any
22         changes, you can, or you can just waive -- waive
23         that.
24              THE WITNESS:  I waive it.
0009
 1              MR. HUMEN:  Okay.
 2              MR. KENNY:  And objection by one defendant
 3         here today is good for all?
 4              MR. HUMEN:  Yes.
 5              MR. KENNY:  And appearance here today is no
 6         waiver of proper service or jurisdictional
 7         defenses.
 8              MR. HUMEN:  Agreed.
 9              MR. KENNY:  Okay.
10                       DIRECT EXAMINATION
11    BY MR. KENNY:
12         Q    Good morning, sir.
13         A    Good morning.
14         Q    My name is Ryan Kenny.  I'm going to be asking
15    you probably most of the questions this morning.  Then
16    there might be a few other attorneys in the room that
17    are going to have some follow-up questions.
18         A    Um-hum.
19         Q    Have you ever had your deposition taken
20    before?
21         A    No.
22         Q    Okay.  One thing that we have to remember here
23    is Niki is taking down everything we say, and so it's
24    important that, unlike normal everyday talk where we are
0010
 1    talking over one another, that you just wait for me to
 2    finish my question before you go ahead with your answer.
 3         A    Um-hum.  Yep.
 4         Q    And I'll do the same.  I'll be respectful and
 5    wait for you to answer --
 6         A    Okay.
 7         Q    -- before I ask my next question.
 8         A    Okay.
 9         Q    After I ask my question and you give me an
10    answer, I'm going to assume that, one, you understood it
11    and, two, it was a truthful answer to the best of your
12    memory.  Okay?
13         A    Um-hum, yes.
14         Q    We are going back many years here.  A lot of
15    things you may not remember, so the last thing I want
16    you to do is guess.  If you don't understand or if you
17    don't know the answer to something, just please tell
18    me --
19         A    Um-hum.
20         Q    -- you know, "I don't know" or "I don't
21    recall"?
22         A    Yep.
23         Q    Okay?
24         A    Yep.
0011
 1         Q    If you need a break at any time, just let us
 2    know.  We'll go off the record, take a quick five.
 3         A    Okay.
 4         Q    It's also important, again Niki taking down
 5    everything we say here, that you remember to answer
 6    verbally.  So she can't take down a shake of the head --
 7         A    Oh, yeah.
 8         Q    -- or a nod or something like that.
 9         A    Yeah.  Okay.
10         Q    All right?
11         A    Okay.
12         Q    And the last thing, if you could just please
13    keep your voice up to the best you can.  We have some
14    folks on the phone.
15         A    Yep.

20         Q    And where were you born, Mr. Donovan?
21         A    Boston, Massachusetts.

23         A    Yes.
24         Q    Okay.  What hospital?
0012
 1         A    Boston City Hospital.
 2         Q    And did you live outside the city growing up?
 3         A    I did.  I lived out in -- I lived in Derry,
 4    New Hampshire, for about 30 years.
 5         Q    Okay.  And what is your date of birth, sir?
 6         A    12-20-42.
 7              MR. KENNY:  And can we go off the record?
 8              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
 9              MR. KENNY:  And back on the record, please.
10    BY MR. KENNY:
11         Q    And what is your current address, Mr. Donovan?

13         Q    And how long have you lived at this address
14    for?
15         A    Ten years, 12 years.  Ten or 12 years.
16         Q    And have you lived at this address full time?
17         A    No, six months out of the year, a little over
18    six months, actually.
19         Q    Where do you live the other six months?
20         A    Dedham, Massachusetts.
21         Q    So you currently still have a residence in
22    Dedham?
23         A    Um-hum.
24         Q    And what's the address of that?
0013
 1         A    4 Calvin Road, C-A-L-V-I-N.
 2         Q    And how long have you lived at that home?
 3         A    Oh, about the same, ten, 12 years.
 4         Q    And when do you leave the Dedham home to come
 5    down to Florida?
 6         A    Usually at the end of August.  I mean, I'm
 7    sorry.  October.
 8         Q    So -- and when do you go back to the home?
 9         A    This year we are going to leave the beginning
10    of May, May 3rd or 4th, something like that.
11         Q    And has that been kind of your routine since
12    you moved down to Florida?
13         A    Yeah, end of April, early May, yeah.  Yeah.
14    Miss the snow.
15         Q    Smart move.
16         A    Yeah.
17         Q    Do you have any plans to move in the future
18    either from your Dedham home or from your Florida home?
19         A    No.
20         Q    As I'm sure you're aware, this case has been
21    filed in Massachusetts.  Would you have any trouble
22    traveling to Massachusetts to testify at this case?
23         A    No.  As long as you pay my freight.
24         Q    Okay.  We'll talk to your lawyer about that.
0014
 1              And, sir, are you currently married?
 2         A    No, widowed.
 3         Q    Sorry to hear that.
 4         A    All right.
 5         Q    Do you and your wife, your former wife have
 6    kids?
 7         A    Yes, three.
 8         Q    And what are their names?
 9         A    Lawrence, Jr., Maureen, and Diane.
10         Q    And how old is Lawrence?
11         A    Forty-nine.
12         Q    Where does he live?
13         A    He lives in New York City, Brooklyn.
14         Q    And how about Maureen?  How old is Maureen?

20    Hampshire.
21         Q    And how are your children's health?
22         A    Good.
23         Q    Good.  And what did your wife pass away from?
24         A    Dementia, I guess, Alzheimer's.
0015
 1         Q    Have either your wife or any of your kids ever
 2    been diagnosed with any form of cancer?
 3         A    No.
 4         Q    And how is your health generally?
 5         A    It's all right.  It's good.
 6         Q    Have you ever been diagnosed with any
 7    asbestos-related disease?
 8         A    Yes, I have pleural plaque.
 9         Q    And when were you diagnosed with pleural
10    plaque?
11         A    Well, actually, as it turns out I have a --
12              THE WITNESS:  Should I show it to him?
13              MR. HUMEN:  You can if you want.  Yeah.
14         A    I had x-rays taken yesterday for something
15    else, and "calcified pleural plaques bilaterally,
16    sequela, S-E-Q-U-E-L-A, of previous asbestos exposure.
17    Small calcified granulomas as seen at the right lung
18    apex.  Prominent thoracic spine end plate -- but that
19    has nothing to do with -- calcifications are seen within
20    the aortic lobe."
21    BY MR. KENNY:
22         Q    With permission of your counsel, do you mind
23    if I take a look at that?
24              THE WITNESS:  All right?
0016
 1              MR. HUMEN:  I don't have a problem with that.
 2              MR. KENNY:  Why don't we go ahead and mark
 3         this, if that's okay?  I'll make a copy of it so he
 4         can take the original home.  We'll mark this as
 5         Exhibit 1.
 6              (Exhibit Number 1 marked for identification.)
 7    BY MR. KENNY:
 8         Q    It looks like it's a one-page report from
 9    Naples Diagnostic Imaging Center from an appointment you
10    had yesterday?
11         A    Um-hum.
12         Q    Now, was this -- was this a follow-up to --
13         A    No.  As it turned out, he thought it was from
14    walking.  I walk a couple of miles a day most days, and
15    my right -- my left nipple was bleeding.  So I went to
16    see if it might have been something in there causing it
17    or whatever was causing it, so he recommended I take an
18    x-ray?
19         Q    Prior to this x-ray, this check-up, had you
20    been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease?
21         A    Same thing years ago, yeah.
22         Q    Do you remember approximately when you may
23    have been diagnosed?
24         A    I'm going to say in the '70s at Mass. General
0017
 1    I had -- then I had follow-ups at Braintree Rehab.  They
 2    used to send us all there for x-rays.  And they came up
 3    with the same diagnosis.  This might be a little worse
 4    than what it used to be.
 5         Q    And when you said "they would send us all
 6    there," who is the "they" you are talking about?
 7         A    Through the union.
 8         Q    Union.
 9         A    It set up x-rays for all the membership.
10         Q    And you were a member of Local 7?
11         A    Local 6.
12         Q    Local 6, I'm sorry.
13         A    Local 7 is iron workers.
14         Q    That's right.  So the first time you believe
15    you were diagnosed with pleural plaques was sometime in
16    the '70s at MGH?
17         A    I think it was, yeah.
18         Q    Do you remember if it was the beginning, mid,
19    late?
20         A    I don't.
21         Q    And you wouldn't be able to tell me the name
22    of the doctor that diagnosed you originally?
23         A    Oh, geez.  It was a woman doctor.  I don't
24    even know if she's there anymore.  I forget.  I can't
0018
 1    remember her name.
 2         Q    Okay.  If it comes back to you, just let me
 3    know at any time.
 4         A    Um-hum.
 5         Q    And that goes for anything that we are talking
 6    about today.
 7         A    Yeah.
 8         Q    If you don't remember something and then you
 9    remember an hour later, feel free, either at a break
10    just tell your attorney, we can go back and revisit.
11         A    Okay.
12         Q    Okay.  So have you ever filed, brought a
13    lawsuit for your asbestos-related disease?
14         A    Well, I went through Thornton & Early at the
15    time.
16         Q    Okay.
17         A    They just started the case.
18         Q    And do you remember when that was?
19         A    Geez, I'm 73 years old now, you know, so my
20    memory is not as good as it used to be.
21         Q    That's fine.  The best you can do.
22         A    Probably the '80s, maybe.
23         Q    And so you had Thornton bring a lawsuit on
24    your behalf --
0019
 1         A    Yeah.
 2         Q    -- for your pleural plaques?
 3         A    Um-hum.
 4         Q    And you sued a number of defendants; is that
 5    correct?
 6         A    Yeah.
 7         Q    Do you know, is that case still pending?  Is
 8    it resolved?
 9         A    I think it's still pending as far as I know.
10    I haven't had any -- any correspondence with any of
11    those for years.
12         Q    Have you received any sort of settlement
13    payments from that lawsuit that you brought?
14         A    Very small.
15         Q    Small?
16         A    Yeah.  I think Haliburton I got one for $6 and
17    change.  They are a very nice company.
18         Q    Is that $6 a month?
19         A    $6 period.
20         Q    Oh, $6 total?
21         A    Yeah.
22         Q    Oh, wow.  Okay.
23         A    Very nice people.
24         Q    Other than the $6, you recall approximately
0020
 1    how much you may have received to date?
 2         A    Probably total of maybe 3,000.
 3         Q    And other than Haliburton, do you remember the
 4    names of any of the other companies that you may have
 5    settled with?
 6         A    I probably have it back home.  I have them
 7    written down somewhere.
 8         Q    Okay.  If you can find that list, I know we
 9    are scheduled to go tomorrow as well.
10         A    Um-hum.
11         Q    If you find that and --
12         A    Yeah.
13         Q    -- bring it, that would be great.
14              Have you ever been diagnosed with any form of
15    cancer?
16         A    Just skin cancer.
17         Q    Skin cancer?
18         A    Yeah.
19         Q    And you're here today to testify in a case
20    that was filed by Peter Crescenzo and his brother,
21    Biagio Crescenzo?
22         A    Um-hum.
23         Q    When were you first contacted?  Or were you
24    contacted by either Peter or Biagio regarding this
0021
 1    lawsuit?
 2         A    No, never.
 3         Q    Were you contacted by their attorneys?
 4         A    No.  Well, just these guys.
 5         Q    Okay.  And are you represented today by Waters
 6    & Kraus or Thornton's office?
 7              MR. HUMEN:  Yes.
 8         A    Yeah.
 9    BY MR. KENNY:
10         Q    Okay.  So because you are represented by
11    Thornton's office, I don't want to know the details of
12    any conversations that you had, but I would like to
13    explore a little bit more about the relationship and how
14    you kind of came here today to testify, okay?
15         A    Um-hum, yeah.
16         Q    When were you first contacted by either Waters
17    & Kraus or Thornton's office?
18         A    I think it was back in February.
19         Q    And were you contacted by phone call or
20    letter?
21         A    Phone call.
22         Q    And do you remember who you spoke with?
23         A    Patrick Wigle.
24         Q    Did Mr. Wigle inform that you the Crescenzo
0022
 1    brothers had filed lawsuits?
 2         A    Um-hum.
 3         Q    Did he ask if you had ever worked with them?
 4         A    Yeah.
 5         Q    Okay.  After that initial phone call, did you
 6    agree to testify as a coworker in their cases?
 7         A    Yes.
 8         Q    Other than that phone call in February, have
 9    you had any other conversations with anyone from Waters
10    & Kraus or Thornton & Naumes -- or Thornton's Law Firm?
11         A    No.  Just Patrick Wigle.
12         Q    And did Patrick call you again after this
13    February?
14         A    Well, he tried to set something I think for
15    February, and that fell through.  Then March again and
16    then finally for this.
17         Q    So you had several follow-up phone calls to
18    kind of reschedule --
19         A    Um-hum.
20         Q    -- when your deposition would take place?
21         A    Um-hum.
22              MR. HUMEN:  Just be careful.  Um-hum and
23         hum-ums are really tough on --
24         A    Oh, yes.
0023
 1              MR. HUMEN:  -- on Niki --
 2         A    Yeah.
 3              MR. HUMEN:  -- trying to type.
 4         A    Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You can't type
 5    um-hum.
 6    BY MR. KENNY:
 7         Q    And did you meet with your attorney prior to
 8    the start of the deposition today?
 9         A    I just talked to him this morning, yeah.
10         Q    Was that the first time you spoke?
11         A    With David.
12         Q    Okay.
13         A    Well, I talked to him on the phone.  He -- you
14    know, to tell me he was going to meet me here.
15         Q    Got you.
16         A    Yeah.
17         Q    And prior to meeting -- prior to the start of
18    the deposition when you guys met today, did you review
19    any lists of any kind?
20         A    I named off some of the jobs I worked with
21    Peter on.  I have a list here.
22         Q    All right.  Other than the job list -- now,
23    did you create that job list yourself?
24         A    I've had this, yeah.  I've had this for years.
0024
 1         Q    Were you shown any lists by your attorney?
 2         A    No.
 3         Q    How about any photographs?
 4         A    No.
 5         Q    Do you mind if we review that, if I take a
 6    look at that list?
 7              THE WITNESS:  Is that all right?
 8              MR. HUMEN:  Yes.
 9         A    Okay.  Sure.  There is two different lists
10    there.
11    BY MR. KENNY:
12         Q    Sure.
13              MR. KENNY:  We'll mark this as Exhibit 2, if
14         that's all right.
15              MR. HUMEN:  Yep.
16              MR. KENNY:  And make a copy on the break.
17              MR. HUMEN:  Do you want to -- there's -- since
18         there is two different lists, do you want to do
19         both as one exhibit or do you want to do them
20         separate?
21              MR. KENNY:  The medical report as -- oh, there
22         is two different work lists here.  Okay.
23         A    Yes.  One's chronological and one is
24    alphabetical.
0025
 1              MR. KENNY:  All right.  Yeah, why don't you do
 2         two different lists?
 3              (Exhibit Number 2 marked for identification.)
 4    BY MR. KENNY:
 5         Q    So this we'll mark as Exhibit 2, which is I
 6    guess entitled "Work History Donovan, Sr., Lawrence T."
 7    And then Exhibit 3 I believe is titled "Jobsite History
 8    for Donovan, Sr., Lawrence T.," run date June 12, 2003.
 9              (Exhibit Number 3 marked for identification.)
10    BY MR. KENNY:
11         Q    Where did you come up with these lists?
12         A    From the lawyer from Thornton & Naumes.
13         Q    Okay.  When were you provided -- or were you
14    provided with these lists?
15         A    2003, is it?
16         Q    And Thornton's office provided you with this
17    list?
18         A    I'm pretty sure it was.
19         Q    Okay.  And how about Exhibit 3?
20         A    Same.
21         Q    They provided you with this list?
22         A    Um-hum.  Well, I wrote all my jobs out that I
23    worked with and gave it to them.
24         Q    Um-hum.
0026
 1         A    And they -- they printed it out like that.
 2         Q    All right.
 3         A    So it's from me, but they printed it out.
 4         Q    And I see on Exhibit 2 here there are some
 5    bullet points.  Are those bullet points that you made?
 6         A    Yeah.
 7         Q    And what do those bullet points indicate?
 8         A    That's a couple of jobs that I remember
 9    working with Peter Crescenzo on.
10         Q    Okay.  I believe those bullet points are
11    International Paper and then Polaroid in Cambridge and
12    Polaroid in Waltham?
13         A    Right.
14         Q    Did you do the same thing for Exhibit 3?  Did
15    you mark any bullets on here?
16         A    I don't think I did, no.
17         Q    Okay.  So other than these lists that were
18    provided by Thornton's office in 2003, have you been
19    provided with any other lists from your attorneys?
20         A    No.
21         Q    Have you personally created any lists, gone
22    back in your memory and tried to remember places you may
23    have worked with either Peter Crescenzo or Biagio?
24         A    I just thought -- you know, I was trying to
0027
 1    think what jobs I did work with them, and I worked with
 2    so many guys.
 3         Q    Sure.
 4         A    Probably almost every guy in the local, but
 5    that's why I put those bullet proof -- points so I would
 6    remember.
 7         Q    Okay.  But you didn't create any handwritten
 8    lists or type up any lists yourself?
 9         A    No.  No.
10         Q    Before today's deposition, did you review
11    Peter Crescenzo's deposition testimony at all?
12         A    No.
13         Q    Did you speak with Peter Crescenzo at all
14    prior to today?
15         A    Nope.  Nope.
16         Q    Did you speak with any co-workers from Local 6
17    prior to today?
18         A    No.  No.  I talked to my business agent, just
19    to let him know I was coming here for a deposition, just
20    to let him know.
21         Q    Okay.
22         A    But he didn't give me any information on
23    anything.  You know, I didn't even know he was
24    deposed -- Peter.
0028
 1         Q    Okay.  Did you do any internet research, go to
 2    the library to do any research?
 3         A    No.
 4         Q    And my questions today are primarily going to
 5    focus on your work with Peter Crescenzo.
 6         A    Um-hum.
 7         Q    Tomorrow we are going to ask you questions
 8    related to Biagio.
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    Just figured that would be kind of an easier
11    way to keep things straight.
12         A    Um-hum.  Yes.
13         Q    So unless, you know, I specifically say, all
14    of my questions today I'm going to ask you about are
15    regarding your work with Peter Crescenzo.
16         A    Um-hum.
17         Q    If you happen to remember that Biagio
18    Crescenzo happened to be on a jobsite with you and
19    Peter, feel free to let us know that; but for the most
20    part, my questions are just going to focus on your work
21    with Peter.
22         A    Okay.
23         Q    When did you and Mr. Crescenzo first meet?
24         A    I would say the early '60s.  I started in '65,
0029
 1    and I think the first job I worked with Peter was in
 2    '68.
 3         Q    And what job was that?
 4         A    Did I -- let me take a peek at this.
 5         Q    Sure.
 6         A    Polaroid in Cambridge.
 7         Q    So you think the first time you met Peter was
 8    on a job in 1968 at the Polaroid in Cambridge?
 9         A    Yeah.  And I worked also Polaroid in Waltham
10    with him, the same year.
11         Q    And you said you started in the early '60s.
12    Just so the record's clear, you started with the Local 6
13    in the early '60s?
14         A    1965.
15         Q    And what was your job title in 1965?
16         A    Apprentice, yeah.
17         Q    Apprentice insulator?
18         A    Yes, first-year apprentice.
19         Q    And how long were you an apprentice for?
20         A    Four years.
21         Q    So from about '65 to '69?
22         A    Um-hum.
23         Q    So when you first started working with Peter
24    at the Polaroid in Cambridge, you were still an
0030
 1    apprentice?
 2         A    Yeah.
 3         Q    Do you know if Peter was also an apprentice?
 4         A    Yes, he was probably first-year apprentice.
 5         Q    Prior to working for the Local 6 in '65, what
 6    was your highest level education?
 7         A    High school.
 8         Q    High school?
 9         A    Um-hum.
10         Q    Did you graduate?
11         A    Yeah.
12         Q    And where did you graduate from?
13         A    Mission High in Roxbury.
14         Q    After you graduated high school, did you
15    receive any certifications or licenses or anything like
16    that during your career?
17         A    Just my journeyman's card when I become a
18    journeyman.
19         Q    So going back to the first time you met Peter
20    in 1968 at the Polaroid in Cambridge, do you remember
21    where exactly in Cambridge the facility was located?
22         A    It was a big complex.  I think it was right on
23    Main Street, I think, in Cambridge, if I am not
24    mistaken.
0031
 1         Q    Do you remember when in 1968 you first started
 2    there?
 3         A    No.
 4         Q    Do you remember maybe what season it would
 5    have been?
 6         A    Probably May or June, something like that.
 7    That's usually when they first hire the apprentices
 8    start a new class.
 9         Q    And did you and Mr. Crescenzo start at the
10    same time?  Was he already there, or did he come after
11    you, if you remember?
12         A    I don't remember.
13         Q    Do you remember how long the two of you were
14    on the job together?
15         A    I would say maybe a couple of months.
16         Q    And you mentioned that you thought that Peter
17    was a apprentice insulator as well as?
18         A    Um-hum.
19              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Is that a "yes"?
20         A    Yes.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yes.
21    BY MR. KENNY:
22         Q    Are you able to describe for me what the
23    Polaroid facility in Cambridge looked like, kind of the
24    layout of the facility?
0032
 1         A    Well, they had different -- different parts to
 2    it.  Some were like ovens.  We used to insulate the
 3    ovens, some piping, the boiler piping, just -- just to
 4    supply the steam or whatever to each part of the
 5    building.
 6         Q    So was the Cambridge facility, was that one
 7    building?
 8         A    Um-hum.
 9         Q    Do you know --
10              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
11    BY MR. KENNY:
12         Q    Sorry.  You have to --
13         A    Yes.  I'm sorry.  Geez.
14         Q    Do you recall approximately how big the
15    building was?
16         A    It took up at least a block, I would say, if I
17    can remember right.
18         Q    Was it one big open floor plan, or was it
19    divided up into several --
20         A    Divided up into separate -- different areas.
21         Q    And were you designated to work in one
22    specific area during the time you were there, or were
23    you working all over the facility?
24         A    Probably all over.  Probably delivering stock
0033
 1    to the different guys and mixing cements and whatever
 2    for them.
 3         Q    And was this facility one floor or two floors?
 4         A    I'm thinking one if I remember right.
 5              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
 6    BY MR. KENNY:
 7         Q    All right.  So one story that was broken up
 8    into several different rooms, you think?
 9         A    Um-hum.
10         Q    Your job as an apprentice insulator, you said
11    you would be delivering stock?
12         A    Um-hum.
13         Q    Mixing cement?
14         A    Um-hum.
15         Q    What other job duties did you have?
16              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Can you say "yes"?
17         A    Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.
18              Putting on some of the insulation.
19    BY MR. KENNY:
20         Q    Would it be fair to say as an apprentice the
21    majority of your work would be kind of more of the grunt
22    work delivering the stock --
23         A    Um-hum.
24         Q    -- and mixing cement?
0034
 1         A    Yeah, especially the first year, like Peter.
 2         Q    Are you able to tell me what percentage of
 3    time you think you were actually applying insulation
 4    versus doing other job duties?
 5         A    Maybe half the time.
 6         Q    And how about Peter?  Are you able to estimate
 7    for me the number of -- or the percentage of time that
 8    he would be applying insulation at the Polaroid facility
 9    in Cambridge versus the other type of --
10         A    He was probably logging the stock and mixing
11    the cement and stuff for the crew most of the time, I
12    would say, maybe throwing on a piece of insulation here
13    and there, but I'm not really sure.  But usually your
14    first-year apprentice, they do all the grunt work, you
15    know, mixing the mud and lugging the dusty cartons of
16    asbestos and whatever.
17         Q    Now, going back to the some of the equipment
18    that you mentioned, you mentioned that there would be
19    ovens that would be insulated, piping throughout the
20    facility that would be insulated?
21         A    Um-hum.
22         Q    Piping that was leading up to boilers that
23    would be have to be insulated?
24         A    Um-hum.
0035
 1              MR. HUMEN:  Yes.
 2         A    Yes.
 3    BY MR. KENNY:
 4         Q    Sorry.  I'm going to get a sign and just hold
 5    it up and say --
 6         A    Yeah.
 7         Q    All right.  So let's start with the ovens.
 8    What type of ovens were these at the facility?
 9         A    I don't know what they used them for.  It's
10    part of their process of making film, I'm thinking.
11         Q    Um-hum.
12         A    I imagine.  But they are probably 6 or 8 feet
13    in diameter, and they had to be insulated by block,
14    Kaylo block, with skim coat and mud.  Then a finished
15    coat of asbestos cement on the outside.
16         Q    Do you know the manufacturer of any of the
17    ovens that had to be insulated at the Polaroid facility?
18         A    I don't remember.
19         Q    Did you ever observe Mr. Crescenzo performing
20    any insulation work on any of these ovens at the
21    Cambridge facility?
22         A    Well, he would hand the pieces to the
23    journeyman to -- to mix the mud and hand them the mud,
24    the buckets of cement.
0036
 1         Q    Okay.  And you mentioned Kaylo block.  Did you
 2    ever observe Mr. Crescenzo handling Kaylo block?
 3         A    Yes.
 4         Q    Then you mentioned it was covered with a mud?
 5         A    Um-hum.
 6         Q    And then after that, there was a asbestos
 7    layer put on?
 8         A    Yeah.
 9         Q    Okay.  Did you ever observe Mr. Crescenzo
10    handling the asbestos layer that would go on?
11         A    Yeah.  He used to mix the mud.  He used to mix
12    it.
13         Q    So is the mud, the asbestos coating, is that
14    the same thing?
15         A    We call them both mud.  One was a one coat,
16    they called it, one-coat cement.  So you put that on as
17    a binder.  Then the asbestos mud cement went over that.
18         Q    Okay.
19         A    Trowelled on.
20         Q    So it goes Kaylo block, one coat, and then the
21    mud?
22         A    Yeah.
23         Q    Got you.  Do you know who manufactured the one
24    coat that went on the ovens?
0037
 1         A    Oh, geez.  You think I would, but I can't
 2    remember offhand.
 3         Q    All right.  How about the mud?
 4         A    That was Vermont Asbestos.
 5         Q    Vermont Asbestos.
 6              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Form.
 7    BY MR. KENNY:
 8         Q    How did the bags of Vermont Asbestos come
 9    packaged?
10         A    They came in 50-pound bags.
11         Q    50 pounds?
12         A    Yeah.
13         Q    That would have to be mixed?
14         A    Yeah.
15         Q    Do you recall ever observing Mr. Crescenzo
16    mixing?
17         A    Um-hum.
18              MR. HUMEN:  Yes?
19         A    Yes.
20    BY MR. KENNY:
21         Q    When you arrived at this facility in 1968 and
22    you were working with Mr. Crescenzo, what stage of
23    construction was the facility in?
24         A    It was -- it was already up.  The building was
0038
 1    already up.  I think this was a whole new system they
 2    were putting in, as far as I can remember.
 3         Q    So the building itself was already erected?
 4         A    Um-hum.
 5         Q    You were just going in and replacing different
 6    systems?
 7         A    Um-hum.
 8              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes.
 9         A    Yes.  Christ Jesus.
10              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  We should take turns.
11    BY MR. KENNY:
12         Q    Now, you also mentioned that piping would be
13    insulated at this facility?
14         A    Um-hum.
15              MR. HUMEN:  Yes?
16         A    Yes.  Christ.
17    BY MR. KENNY:
18         Q    What type of piping was this at the facility
19    that had to be insulated?
20         A    Steam piping.
21         Q    Steam piping?
22         A    Mostly steam piping, yeah.
23         Q    Are you able to estimate for me the number of
24    feet or steam piping that made a run through this
0039
 1    facility?
 2         A    Oh, geez.  It's hard to say.  It's hundreds of
 3    feet, I would say.
 4         Q    Now, you mentioned that the piping itself
 5    would have to be insulated.  Was there already currently
 6    insulation on the pipe and it had to be replaced, or
 7    were you insulating these steam pipes new?
 8         A    As far as I remember, it was all new; but
 9    where they had to cut into old pipe, they'd have to take
10    some off to put in a T in some other -- you know, a new
11    direction.
12         Q    But fair to say the majority of the insulation
13    put on the pipes was new?
14         A    Yeah.
15         Q    Did you ever observe Mr. Crescenzo putting new
16    insulation on the steam piping at the Polaroid facility?
17         A    I don't remember him putting the piping on --
18    the insulation on, no, but I remember him handling it
19    and giving it to the guys to put on.
20         Q    And what type of insulation was this that was
21    going on?
22         A    Kaylo.  It's a white, Kaylo, calcium silicate.
23         Q    And what was the process of putting this
24    insulation on the steam piping?
0040
 1         A    They would wire it on.
 2         Q    Um-hum.
 3         A    Is that what you mean?
 4         Q    Yes.
 5         A    Just wire it, you know, tie the wire on it,
 6    break all the joints, tie the -- tie it on with wire.
 7         Q    So other than putting on the insulation,
 8    keeping it on the pipe with the wiring, was there
 9    anything else that needed to be done to the pipe
10    insulation?
11         A    They put a coating afterwards of aluminum.
12    Most of the time it was aluminum.  Then they went to PVC
13    after that.  I'm not sure if they used it on that job.
14         Q    And you also mentioned that there was piping
15    that had to be insulated that led up to the boilers at
16    the facility?
17         A    Um-hum.
18         Q    Do you recall how many boilers were at this
19    facility?
20         A    I'm thinking one, but I'm not -- I can't swear
21    to it.
22         Q    What size are we talking about here for this
23    boiler?
24         A    Oh, it was probably -- I can't tell you the
0041
 1    size.  It's a good-size big boiler.
 2         Q    When you say good size, was it 6 feet tall?
 3    Was it 60 feet tall?  Are you able to estimate at all?
 4         A    Maybe -- I don't remember.
 5         Q    Do you recall the manufacturer of the boiler
 6    at this facility?
 7         A    I don't know if it was Foster Wheeler.  I
 8    think it was Foster Wheeler, but I can't swear to it.
 9         Q    And you mentioned that you recalled seeing
10    piping leading up to the boiler being insulated?
11         A    Um-hum.
12              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
13         A    Yes.
14    BY MR. KENNY:
15         Q    Sorry.  Do you recall ever seeing any work
16    being done on the boiler itself when you were working
17    there?
18         A    I can't remember.  I can't remember.
19         Q    And what type of insulation was being put on
20    the pipes that was leading up to the boiler?
21         A    Same, calcium silicate.
22         Q    Did you ever observe Mr. Crescenzo applying
23    this insulation on the pipes leading up to the boiler?
24         A    No.  I saw him handling it, giving it to the
0042
 1    journeyman to put on.
 2         Q    But the actual process of installing it, you
 3    never saw him do that?
 4         A    No.
 5         Q    So we talked about the ovens had to be
 6    insulated, the piping, steam piping throughout the
 7    facility, the piping leading up to the boiler.  Are
 8    there any other types of equipment that you recalled
 9    insulating or recalled seeing Mr. Crescenzo insulate at
10    that facility?
11         A    I don't remember.
12         Q    Do you know when Mr. Crescenzo left that
13    facility?
14         A    At the end of the job, you mean?
15         Q    Yeah.
16         A    Oh, maybe -- I don't know.  Maybe two or three
17    months later.
18         Q    So if he started -- do you think he started
19    there in May or June?
20         A    I'm thinking that.
21         Q    And so he might have left in August or
22    September?
23         A    Something like that, yeah, as far as I can
24    remember.  You know, it's --
0043
 1         Q    Yep.  And you mentioned that you also worked
 2    at the Polaroid facility in Waltham together?
 3         A    Um-hum.
 4         Q    Did you go from the Polaroid --
 5              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
 6         A    Yes.  Jesus.
 7              MR. KENNY:  Thank you, guys, for picking all
 8         this up.  I just keep going.
 9              MR. HUMEN:  It's tough because it's a habit in
10         regular conversation.
11              THE WITNESS:  Yeah, yeah.
12    BY MR. KENNY:
13         Q    Did you go from the Polaroid facility in
14    Cambridge directly to the Polaroid facility in Waltham?
15         A    I don't remember that, but I remember working
16    at both facilities.
17         Q    And you remember Mr. Crescenzo was working at
18    the Polaroid facility in Waltham?
19         A    Um-hum.
20              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
21         A    Yes.  Jesus.
22    BY MR. KENNY:
23         Q    Okay.  And so you think -- you don't know when
24    you started there, but how long do you think you worked
0044
 1    at this facility for?
 2         A    I would say months, a few months anyway.
 3         Q    Three months?
 4         A    A few, three or four months, I would say.
 5    Sometimes you're on a job for three or four months.
 6    They will pull you off that job and send you somewhere
 7    else and then maybe send you back there afterwards, you
 8    know, but --
 9         Q    And when you first arrived at the facility in
10    Waltham, was Mr. Crescenzo already working there?
11         A    I think he was already working there.
12         Q    Do you know how long he may have been working
13    there by the time you showed up?
14         A    I don't know.
15         Q    After you left three or four months later, was
16    he still working there or had he left?
17         A    I don't remember that either.
18         Q    Okay.  So let's just focus on the three or
19    four months that you were there and you recall seeing
20    him working there as well.
21         A    Um-hum.
22         Q    Again, I'm going to kind of run through the
23    same questions with regard to the Waltham facility.  How
24    are you doing?  You want to take a quick five?
0045
 1         A    Just sip water.
 2         Q    We can take a quick break.
 3         A    If you want, yeah, that's fine.
 4              (Off the record from 10:36 a.m. until
 5         10:48 a.m.)
 6              MR. KENNY:  Back on the record.
 7    BY MR. KENNY:
 8         Q    Ready to continue, sir?
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    All right.  There you go.  When you started
11    working at the Waltham facility, were you still an
12    apprentice insulator at the time or were you now a full
13    time insulator?
14         A    Was that the -- let me --
15         Q    Sorry.  Your list is being copied.
16         A    Yeah.  I think it was a mechanic.  I think I
17    was a journeyman.
18         Q    And how about Mr. Crescenzo?  Do you remember?
19         A    I would have to look at the paper.  I forget.
20         Q    Okay.
21              MR. HUMEN:  Do you want to just hold off and
22         wait until we get that back?
23              MR. KENNY:  I mean, I can go back to those
24         questions.  I would rather just keep moving, move
0046
 1         along, if that's all right.
 2              MR. HUMEN:  Okay.
 3    BY MR. KENNY:
 4         Q    Now, when you became a journeyman, did your
 5    job duties change at all?
 6         A    Well, you did more of the application.  You --
 7    sometimes you'd run work, you know, if you were first
 8    guy on the job, it was a small job, you would end up
 9    being the boss, you know, the foreman.
10         Q    Um-hum.  Now, when you were working at the
11    Waltham facility, it's fair to say you were doing less
12    of the grunt work and more of the everyday insulator
13    work?
14         A    Yeah, yeah.
15         Q    And are you able to remember whether or not
16    Mr. Crescenzo was kind of doing more of the every day
17    work and less of the grunt work at this facility?
18         A    I think he was doing more, because the way you
19    go along in your apprenticeship, the more duties they
20    give you, installing the stuff and the insulation.
21         Q    So once they see you are able to do the work,
22    they give you more responsibility?
23         A    Yeah.  Yeah.
24         Q    Now, similar to the Polaroid facility in
0047
 1    Cambridge -- I asked you about the layout there -- are
 2    you able to describe for me the layout in the Waltham
 3    facility?
 4         A    They had many buildings there, but the major
 5    one was, I would say, at least six or seven stories
 6    tall, and the other one, the boiler room was probably
 7    six or seven stories.  And that supplied the -- I would
 8    say there's probably four or five outbuildings too that
 9    were a good size.
10         Q    You said four or five outbuildings?
11         A    Yes, other buildings besides the --
12         Q    Okay.  Now, this main building that was six or
13    seven stories high, was it an open floor plan or was it
14    divided up into different rooms?
15         A    I know they had a big cafeteria on one floor.
16    I think it was different -- different parts, different
17    sections.
18         Q    And were you designated to work in a
19    particular area of this main building during your time
20    there?
21         A    Well, you'd bounce around different, if they
22    needed you over here, they'd put you over here; if they
23    needed you over there, they'd put you over there, you
24    know, but --
0048
 1         Q    Did you ever work in the four or five other
 2    buildings that you described --
 3         A    I worked in the boiler room.  Used to -- I
 4    think the buildings were numbered like C for one
 5    building or something like that, but I forget.  They
 6    have since ripped it all down anyway.
 7         Q    So you think each of the buildings at the
 8    Polaroid facility at Waltham had a numerical and
 9    alphabetical --
10         A    I think so.
11         Q    But you are not able to tell me what those
12    numbers are for the different buildings?
13         A    No.  Not right off the top of my head.
14         Q    So other than the boiler room in the main
15    building, did you work anywhere else at this facility?
16         A    Yeah.  I probably worked on each one of the
17    buildings at one time or another; but as far as this
18    particular time with Peter, it was the boiler room and I
19    think it's called the coating building where they coated
20    the film.  I'm not sure of that.
21         Q    And what was manufactured, what was going on
22    in the main building?
23         A    They made film, I'm pretty sure, for the
24    Polaroid cameras.
0049
 1         Q    So let's start with your work with Peter in
 2    the boiler room.  So this boiler room, was this a
 3    separate building --
 4         A    Um-hum.
 5         Q    -- off from anything else?
 6         A    Yeah.
 7         Q    And other than boilers, was there any other
 8    equipment in this room?
 9         A    There was, like, ductwork, tanks, you know,
10    piping.
11         Q    Anything else?
12         A    That's about it.  I think as far as I know.
13         Q    Now, you mentioned the boiler room was six or
14    seven stories high.
15         A    Um-hum.
16         Q    Was it, if you were standing on the ground
17    floor and you looked up, you could look all the way to
18    the top or were there different levels?
19         A    There were different levels, but there were
20    grates too, grating.
21         Q    Got you.  And what were your job duties when
22    you were working in the boiler room?
23         A    Applying insulation to the boiler, applying
24    insulation to the piping.
0050
 1         Q    Anything else?
 2         A    No.
 3         Q    Did you ever observe Mr. Crescenzo performing
 4    any work in the boiler room?
 5         A    Um-hum.
 6         Q    And what do you recall seeing him do?
 7              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Got to say "yes."
 8              MR. KENNY:  Sorry.
 9         A    Oh, yes.  Geez, I got it right in front of me
10    too.
11              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  That would be yes.
12         A    Applying insulation to the boilers and the
13    piping, same as me.
14    BY MR. KENNY:
15         Q    So you recall seeing Mr. Crescenzo applying
16    insulation to the boilers and the piping?
17         A    Um-hum.  Yep.
18         Q    And, again, this facility when you were
19    working there with Mr. Crescenzo and the work you were
20    performing, was it new insulation work or were you guys
21    removing old insulation and applying new?
22         A    We removed some of the old but mostly all
23    new -- new insulation.
24         Q    And what type of insulation were you using on
0051
 1    the piping in the boiler room?
 2         A    That was also Kaylo.
 3         Q    Similar to what we talked about at the other
 4    facility?
 5         A    Yes.
 6         Q    Was there anything different in the
 7    application of the insulation on this piping at this
 8    facility versus the one in Cambridge?
 9         A    It's usually mostly the same, same application
10    for just about every job.
11         Q    And, again, are you able to estimate the
12    number of feet of piping that you performed insulation
13    work on in the boiler room?
14         A    Probably hundreds of feet, couple of hundred
15    feet maybe.
16         Q    Are you able to estimate for me the number of
17    feet of piping you saw, you personally saw Mr. Crescenzo
18    insulating in the boiler room?
19         A    I couldn't tell that.  You just keep going
20    until it's done, you know.
21         Q    Okay.  Then you also mentioned you performed
22    some insulation work on the boiler?
23         A    Um-hum.
24              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Is that a "yes"?
0052
 1         A    Yes.  Jesus.  And I got it right in front of
 2    me like I said.
 3    BY MR. KENNY:
 4         Q    Was there more than one boiler in this room?
 5         A    I don't think so.  As far as I know, it was
 6    the only one.
 7         Q    Are you able to describe for me the dimensions
 8    of the boiler in this room?
 9         A    40 feet wide by 50 feet in and six stories
10    high.
11         Q    And what -- what parts of the boiler were you
12    personally insulating at this facility?
13         A    The boiler walls and the piping going and
14    coming from the boiler.
15         Q    Do you recall if the insulation you were
16    putting on the boiler walls was new insulation?
17         A    Yes, it was.
18         Q    So was this a new boiler that was installed?
19         A    It might have been stripped and then
20    re-insulated.  I don't know, but it was all new that we
21    put on it.
22         Q    But you weren't present during the process
23    where it was stripped?
24         A    No.
0053
 1         Q    And you don't -- do you know if Mr. Crescenzo
 2    was present during --
 3         A    I don't know that either.
 4         Q    And what type of new insulation did you put on
 5    the boiler walls?
 6         A    Kaylo block.
 7         Q    Kaylo block?
 8         A    Um-hum.
 9         Q    Can you describe the process for me of
10    applying the Kaylo block to the boiler walls?
11         A    They would pin -- if I can remember correctly,
12    they had a pin gun would zap pins in between each pipe
13    and push the Kaylo block onto that and put it on with a
14    clip.
15         Q    And this is work that you personally
16    performed?
17         A    Um-hum.
18              MR. HUMEN:  Yes?
19              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
20         A    Yes.
21    BY MR. KENNY:
22         Q    And did you -- did you observe Mr. Crescenzo
23    ever doing this type of work with Kaylo block on the
24    boiler wall?
0054
 1         A    Yes.
 2         Q    And then you also mentioned that you performed
 3    insulation work on the piping leading up to the boiler?
 4         A    Yes.
 5         Q    Was this similar to the insulation work that
 6    you did on the piping throughout the boiler room?
 7         A    Um-hum.
 8              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
 9         A    Yes.  God.
10    BY MR. KENNY:
11         Q    Is there anything different about the
12    application of the insulation that you did on the piping
13    leading up to the boilers versus the other piping in the
14    boiler room?
15         A    No.  It was mostly the same.
16         Q    Are you able to estimate for me the amount of
17    time that you've spent performing work in the boiler
18    room versus the other parts of the Waltham facility?
19         A    Probably a couple of months, two or three
20    months in each -- each part of it, I would say.
21         Q    So if you were there -- now I'm talking about
22    again just your time with Peter.
23         A    Yes.
24         Q    You think you guys were there together for
0055
 1    about three or four months?
 2         A    I would say so.
 3         Q    Of that three or four months, are you able to
 4    tell me how much time the two of you spent working
 5    together in the boiler room?
 6         A    Well, I mean all different sections and the
 7    same boiler, so probably for the two or three months,
 8    you know, not side by each, you know, but in the same
 9    area.
10         Q    Um-hum.  Okay.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
11    thought you said you also did work in other aspects of
12    the facility other than the boiler room?
13         A    I did, yeah.
14         Q    All right.  So if you're there for three to
15    four months, you weren't working a hundred percent of
16    the time in the boiler room; right?
17         A    No.  When that was near completion, we just
18    moved -- followed the piping out into the other
19    buildings and did ductwork and piping in the other
20    buildings also.
21         Q    Okay.  So that ductwork you did and the work
22    you did on the other piping leading outside the boiler
23    room, are you able to tell me what percentage of the
24    time that work was versus your time in the boiler room
0056
 1    itself?
 2         A    I don't know.  We just worked until it was
 3    done.
 4         Q    All right.
 5         A    I can't tell, you know, if it was two months
 6    or a month or what.
 7         Q    And you mentioned that you did work on tanks?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    What type of tanks were these?
10         A    It's like a holding tank for the overflow
11    water, I would say, from -- I don't know the specific
12    name for it.
13         Q    Was it hot water? cold water?
14         A    Hot water.
15         Q    So you put insulation on the tanks?
16         A    Um-hum.
17              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
18         A    Yes.
19    BY MR. KENNY:
20         Q    Do you know what type of insulation you put on
21    the tanks?
22         A    I think it's the same stuff, the Kaylo block.
23         Q    Again, were these tanks already insulated and
24    insulation had to be removed, or was this new insulation
0057
 1    being put on the tanks?
 2         A    New insulation, as far as I can remember.
 3         Q    Do you know approximately how many tanks had
 4    to be insulated at that facility?
 5         A    I don't know, a couple, two -- I don't know.
 6         Q    Now, were these larger tanks?  Are you able to
 7    describe for me the diameter of them at all?
 8         A    Probably 8, 10 feet around.
 9         Q    And what part of the tank would have to be
10    insulated?
11         A    The whole tank.
12         Q    Including the top?
13         A    Top, bottom, sides.
14         Q    And the insulation of the tank, was that
15    work -- did you ever see Mr. Crescenzo performing that
16    work at the Waltham facility?
17         A    Um-hum.
18              MR. HUMEN:  Yes.
19         A    Yes, we all did.  Yes.
20    BY MR. KENNY:
21         Q    And you also mentioned there was some ductwork
22    at the facility?
23         A    Yeah.  One of the other buildings, and I think
24    that was done by -- with fiberglass board.
0058
 1         Q    Fiberglass board?
 2         A    Yeah.
 3         Q    How long did the ductwork insulation take you
 4    to do?
 5         A    That was probably a few weeks.
 6         Q    And was Peter working with you during this
 7    time?
 8         A    Some of the time.  There was other guys there
 9    too, you know, on and off.
10         Q    Now, when you were working at the Waltham
11    facility, did they have different shifts that workers
12    would come in?
13         A    No.
14         Q    Just all one shift?
15         A    Um-hum.
16              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Yes?
17         A    Yes.  Christ.
18    BY MR. KENNY:
19         Q    When you showed up to the Waltham facility in
20    the morning, did you have a supervisor or foreman that
21    would tell you what your duties were for the day?
22         A    Yeah.  But you -- if you started on this
23    piping here, you would -- you know, usually you were on
24    that until it was over.
0059
 1         Q    Right.
 2         A    Unless they had, you know, another job they
 3    wanted done faster somewhere else.  Yeah.
 4         Q    And the same goes -- I didn't ask you this,
 5    but the same goes for the Cambridge facility when you
 6    would show up to work.  You would have someone that
 7    would tell you what you had to do that day --
 8         A    Yeah.
 9         Q    -- or you would just continue on a project
10    that you had done earlier?
11         A    They would tell you, too, if they wanted to
12    pull you off that and put you on something else, you
13    know, which --
14         Q    With the Waltham facility, the Polaroid
15    Waltham facility, of the three to four months that you
16    think you worked with Peter, are you able to tell me
17    what percentage of that time the two of you were
18    actually working side by side versus maybe you going off
19    on another job or him going off on another job?
20         A    I can't tell you.  I don't know.
21         Q    Is it fair to say, though, that you weren't
22    working with him a hundred percent of the time?
23         A    Oh, yeah.  I wasn't a hundred percent, no.
24         Q    The same with the Cambridge facility?
0060
 1         A    Um-hum.  Same thing, yes.  Yeah.
 2         Q    Getting better.
 3         A    Yes.  Geez, not much.
 4         Q    So other than the ductwork, the work in the
 5    boiler room on the boiler and the piping, work on the
 6    tanks, is there any other type of work that you recall
 7    doing with Mr. Crescenzo at this facility?
 8         A    I can't recall anything else.
 9         Q    All right.  Sorry to keep jumping back here,
10    but I'm just remembering some questions.  Do you
11    remember any of the names of any co-workers that you and
12    Mr. Crescenzo worked with at the Cambridge facility?
13         A    Tommy Whalen I think was one.  Tommy Whalen
14    was on the Waltham one too.
15         Q    How about supervisor, do you remember any
16    supervisors's names either at Cambridge or Waltham?
17         A    I think Tommy Whalen was a supervisor on the
18    Waltham job.  And I can't remember, you know.  You work
19    with so many guys on so many different jobs.
20         Q    That's okay.  If you -- again, like I say, if
21    you remember, you know, you go home tonight --
22         A    Yeah.
23         Q    -- and a name pops in your head --
24         A    Um-hum.
0061
 1         Q    -- just let us know tomorrow.
 2         A    Yeah.
 3         Q    Okay.  So after leaving the Waltham facility,
 4    where do you recall working next with Mr. Crescenzo?
 5         A    Let me check my paperwork here.  Christ.
 6              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Can we pass those lists
 7         around?
 8         A    International Paper in Jay, Maine.
 9    BY MR. KENNY:
10         Q    Do you remember when you first started working
11    at the International Paper in Jay, Maine?
12         A    I was up there when they first started the
13    job.  It was -- I started there in the '60s, but they
14    would have different, different jobs after that, put a
15    new paper machine in.  So they had to do all the
16    different piping to that machine.  So back then this was
17    in '76.
18         Q    '76 is when you remember working with
19    Mr. Crescenzo?
20         A    With Peter, yeah.
21         Q    Was that the only time that you recall working
22    with Mr. Crescenzo at the International Paper in Jay?
23         A    Yeah.
24         Q    But you had been to that facility earlier on?
0062
 1         A    I was up there in 1965, I think, with Benny.
 2         Q    And where in Jay, Maine, was it located if you
 3    remember, like a street address?
 4         A    Oh, geez.  I know you got to go through
 5    Livermore Falls, some little town.  This Jay, Maine, is
 6    just a small little town.  It's on the river.  They're
 7    mostly all on the river, these paper mills.  I can't
 8    remember.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Route 16.  I
 9    can't -- I can't remember for sure.
10         Q    When you were working there in '76 with Peter,
11    how long did you work together?
12         A    I would say a couple of months on and off, you
13    know, not every day.  You know, I might work a couple of
14    days this week and maybe a day or two next week.
15         Q    Um-hum.  And Jay, Maine, is pretty far up
16    there?
17         A    Yeah.  It's -- after Lewiston, so it's --
18    yeah, it's a good ride.
19         Q    Were you doing a commute back and forth --
20         A    No, no.
21         Q    -- were you staying there?
22         A    We stayed there.  Yeah.
23         Q    And how about Peter?  Do you remember if he
24    would stay up there too?
0063
 1         A    Oh, yeah, we all did.  You couldn't commute
 2    from there.
 3         Q    Kind of go home on the weekends and then come
 4    back?
 5         A    Yeah.  Yeah.
 6         Q    And, again, were there designated shifts that
 7    the workers work at, or was it one shift?
 8         A    Mostly one shift, I would say, one shift.
 9         Q    And what were the hours?
10         A    Probably 7:00 to 3:30, or 8:00 for 4:30, you
11    know, one of the two.
12         Q    Did they give you any opportunity to work
13    overtime either later in the day or on the weekends?
14         A    I don't remember working much overtime then.
15    It might have come on here and there, you know.
16         Q    Um-hum.
17         A    Maybe, you know, but --
18         Q    And at this point, were you a full-time
19    insulator?
20         A    Yeah.
21         Q    And was Peter a full-time insulator?
22         A    Um-hum.
23              MR. HUMEN:  Yes?
24         A    Yes.
0064
 1    BY MR. KENNY:
 2         Q    And what type of work were you performing at
 3    the International Paper in 1976?
 4         A    We were doing the boiler walls with 48 -- 48
 5    insulation they call it.  It was, like, 4 inches thick,
 6    something like that.  Fiberglass piping, some of the
 7    piping.  We used fiberglass insulation on that.
 8         Q    On the piping?
 9         A    Um-hum.
10              MR. HUMEN:  Yes?
11         A    Yes.  Jesus.
12    BY MR. KENNY:
13         Q    And similar to my questions about the Polaroid
14    facilities, are you able to tell me what the layout
15    looked like at International Paper?
16         A    Oh, geez.  It was a big facility.  I don't
17    know how many paper machines.  It was big, acres, the
18    whole facility.
19         Q    Multiple buildings?
20         A    Yeah.
21         Q    And during the time that you were there --
22    strike that.
23              How long did you work together with Peter at
24    this facility for?
0065
 1         A    I would say for a few months anyway.
 2         Q    Three or four months?
 3         A    Yeah, I would say so, at least.
 4         Q    During that three to four months, were you
 5    designated in one area of the International Paper
 6    facility or did you guys move around?
 7         A    It was mostly the boiler room at that time,
 8    doing the boiler.
 9         Q    Now, was this a new boiler that was being
10    installed?
11         A    I think it was, but I can't swear to it.
12         Q    And do you recall the manufacturer of the
13    boiler?
14         A    Geez.  I don't know if it was Riley Stoker.  I
15    can't say for certain.
16         Q    Was there more than one boiler in this room,
17    or was it just one?
18         A    No, just one and that was floors too.  It was
19    a good-size boiler.
20         Q    So you think a new boiler was being installed
21    and you guys were putting 48-inch board on it?
22         A    Yeah.
23         Q    Do you know how long that job took?
24         A    That was months also.
0066
 1         Q    So if you were there three to four months, do
 2    you think this work in the boiler room took the majority
 3    of the time that you were there working together?
 4         A    Yeah.
 5         Q    Do you recall working anywhere else with Peter
 6    other than in the boiler room at International Paper?
 7         A    I don't recall.
 8         Q    How about co-workers at this jobsite in '76,
 9    do you remember the names of any of the co-workers?
10         A    Freddy, Freddy McGovern was the boss.  Peter
11    was like a foreman.  Geez.  Joe Nelson, Kenny O'Connell.
12    I can't remember the other.  There was a bunch more
13    guys, though.
14         Q    Now, what was your job title at this job?
15         A    Insulator.
16         Q    Insulator?
17         A    Yeah.
18         Q    Not a supervisor, just a insulator?
19         A    No.  Yeah.
20         Q    Do you think Peter was working as a foreman at
21    the time?
22         A    Yeah.
23         Q    Because Peter was working as a foreman at the
24    time, were his job duties any different than your job
0067
 1    duties as a insulator?
 2         A    Well, he'd just -- Freddy would say where he
 3    wanted the men put, and he would put the men there, and
 4    then he would work with the tools somewhat, too, Peter,
 5    you know.  He wasn't just a -- you know, he was a
 6    working foreman.
 7         Q    And you mentioned in the boiler room you were
 8    also putting in some insulation on the piping?
 9         A    Um-hum.
10         Q    Is this piping that was leading up to the
11    boiler?
12         A    Yes.  Yes.
13         Q    And -- but you think that this piping was
14    fiberglass insulation?
15         A    I'm pretty sure it was because, back then, I
16    don't think you could use asbestos anymore.
17         Q    Do you have a recollection as to when the use
18    of asbestos may have been banned from your workplace?
19         A    I'm thinking it was either '70 or '72, I
20    think, but they could use -- if they had asbestos left
21    in their warehouses or whatever they could use it up,
22    and that would be it.
23         Q    Okay.
24         A    As far as I can remember.
0068
 1         Q    You mentioned that either '70 or '72 you think
 2    that asbestos could no longer be used in the workplace.
 3    Do you remember seeing something or going to a safety
 4    meeting and being told this, or how do you remember
 5    that?
 6         A    It might have been told at the union meetings.
 7    I forget.  I don't know.
 8         Q    Sorry to jump back again, but we talked about
 9    the boiler at the Waltham facility, but I don't think I
10    asked you the manufacturer.  Do you know the
11    manufacturer of that boiler?
12         A    Foster Wheeler, I think it was Foster Wheeler.
13         Q    I want to talk a little bit more about the
14    union meetings where you think you may have been told
15    that asbestos would be hazardous to your health.  Did
16    the Local 6 have regular union meetings for its workers?
17         A    Oh, yeah.
18         Q    About how often would they have those
19    meetings?
20         A    Once a month.
21         Q    Once a month.  And what types of things were
22    discussed at these meetings?
23         A    Union business.
24         Q    Okay.  And could you elaborate a little bit
0069
 1    more on union business?
 2         A    What different jobs were coming up, how the
 3    workload was, benefits, you know, if you were up for a
 4    raise, what we want to do is disburse the monies we
 5    would get, just, you know, just union business.
 6         Q    And were safety precautions part of these
 7    meetings?
 8         A    I guess.  I don't know.
 9         Q    But you do remember the topic of the hazard of
10    asbestos coming up at these meetings?
11         A    I'm thinking that's where I heard it.
12         Q    How about at any of the jobsites that we
13    discussed here today either at Cambridge, the Polaroid
14    in Cambridge, the Polaroid in Waltham, or the
15    International Paper, do you recall at any of those three
16    jobsites where you were working with Peter if you ever
17    had meetings where they discussed the hazards of
18    asbestos?
19         A    No, not that I can recall.
20         Q    How about signage?  Do you ever recall seeing
21    any signs saying, you know, "warning asbestos," "warning
22    contains asbestos"?
23         A    I can't recall, but I know when they started
24    stripping the asbestos on certain jobs, they did -- they
0070
 1    would have to encase it all, you know, plastic and then
 2    have warnings up there.  But I don't think it was on
 3    these jobs.
 4         Q    All right.  Do you remember we were talking
 5    about abatement work, asbestos abatement work?
 6         A    Um-hum.
 7         Q    Yes?
 8         A    Yes.
 9         Q    Okay.  Do you remember the first time that you
10    were working at a jobsite where you recalled seeing
11    asbestos abatement being done?
12         A    It was one of the powerhouses.  I forget which
13    one it was honestly.  But they encased the whole thing
14    with plastic.  They had different doors you'd come in
15    and out of and showers and everything, clean room, dirty
16    room, shower.
17         Q    Do you remember approximately what year that
18    might have been or even decade?
19         A    I would say in the '80s.
20         Q    Do you know if it was early '80s, mid '80s,
21    late '80s?
22         A    I don't know.  I don't know.
23         Q    Okay.  How about when you were working at the
24    Cambridge -- the Polaroid facility in Cambridge, were
0071
 1    you provided any protective equipment, either mask,
 2    goggles, respirator, anything like that?
 3         A    No, not that I can recall.
 4         Q    How about paper masks?  Were the insulators
 5    provided with any paper masks?
 6         A    On some jobs they would have their own, they
 7    would wear them, you know; but I don't know if they
 8    supplied them or not.
 9         Q    Do you recall if you ever wore any protective
10    equipment when you were working at the Polaroid in
11    Cambridge?
12         A    I can't remember.  I don't remember.
13         Q    Do you recall if you ever saw Mr. Crescenzo
14    wearing any protective equipment when he was working at
15    the --
16         A    No.
17         Q    -- Polaroid facility in Cambridge?
18         A    No.
19         Q    And same goes for Waltham.  Did you wear any
20    protective equipment at Waltham?
21         A    No.
22         Q    Do you ever recall seeing Mr. Crescenzo
23    wearing any protective equipment in Waltham?
24         A    I don't recall.
0072
 1         Q    And lastly International Paper in '76, at that
 2    time, did you start wearing any protective equipment
 3    when you were working --
 4         A    We wore paper masks a lot of the times, just,
 5    yeah --
 6         Q    When you were work --
 7         A    -- for dust --
 8         Q    Okay?
 9         A    For dust particles.
10         Q    When you were working in the boiler room at
11    International Paper, would you be wearing a paper mask?
12         A    Sometimes you would, yeah.
13         Q    And how about Peter?  Do you remember seeing
14    him wear a paper mask when he was working in the boiler
15    room?
16         A    I think most -- all the guys did by then.  You
17    know, they started wearing them.
18         Q    Do you know if the insulators, any of the
19    insulators you worked with took extra safety steps like
20    to wear a respirator instead of a paper mask?
21         A    The only time I remember wearing a
22    full-fledged respirator was down in the Plymouth
23    powerhouse --
24         Q    Do you remember --
0073
 1         A    -- nuclear plant.
 2         Q    Do you remember what year that was?
 3         A    I got it here somewhere, but that was in '87.
 4    '87, yeah.
 5         Q    Any of the three jobsites that we discussed
 6    today, do you ever recall OSHA visiting any of those
 7    three sites?
 8         A    I don't remember.
 9         Q    So at International Paper other than the work
10    in the boiler room on the boiler itself as well as on
11    the piping in the boiler room, do you recall working on
12    any other equipment at this facility with Peter?
13         A    I don't recall, no.
14         Q    When you were working for the union, do you
15    ever recall receiving a periodical called the asbestos
16    worker?
17         A    Asbestos Workers Journal we used to get.
18         Q    All right.
19         A    Yeah.
20         Q    And what type of information was in that
21    journal, if you remember?
22         A    I just got one the other day too.  Just what
23    was going on at other locals throughout the country and,
24    you know, nothing -- nothing as far as this stuff here
0074
 1    goes.
 2         Q    All right.  Do you ever recall seeing anything
 3    about health hazards with regard to asbestos in the
 4    Asbestos Worker Journal?
 5         A    I remember them talking about, yeah, the
 6    asbestos, yeah, and Mount Sinai, the doctor there --
 7    geez, I should know his name too.  He since passed away
 8    too.  But they did all the research for it at Mount
 9    Sinai Hospital.
10         Q    Do you remember when you first started seeing
11    publications in the Asbestos Workers magazine about
12    asbestos being harmful or these health studies that you
13    were talking about?
14         A    I'm not sure what year, but probably late
15    '70s, early '80s, maybe.
16         Q    So other than the Polaroid in Waltham, the
17    Polaroid in Cambridge and the International Paper in
18    Jay, do you remember any other jobsites where you and
19    Peter Crescenzo worked together?
20         A    I don't remember.  We might have been on the
21    same job with different companies, too.
22         Q    Um-hum.
23         A    That could have happened, but I can't recall.
24         Q    Okay.
0075
 1              MR. KENNY:  Why don't we go off the record?
 2              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
 3              MR. KENNY:  All right, sir, back on the
 4         record.
 5    BY MR. KENNY:
 6         Q    We talked about the safely meetings that you
 7    attended when you were a member of the -- you are still
 8    a member of the Local 6?
 9         A    I am.  Retired member.
10         Q    Okay.  Do you recall when you were attending
11    any of those meetings if Peter was at any of the
12    meetings that you would go to?
13         A    Union meetings?
14         Q    Yes.
15         A    Oh, yeah.
16         Q    Do you remember the first time you saw Peter
17    at the union meeting?
18         A    Oh, I don't know, probably when he first
19    joined and since then, you know.
20         Q    Sure.
21         A    He wouldn't go to every meeting, but I would
22    see him, you know, quite frequently.
23         Q    So you guys met, you said, in 1968.  You think
24    you may have seen him at meetings in the '60s?
0076
 1         A    Yeah.  I would say so.
 2         Q    Now, I forget to ask you.  I know you're --
 3         A    I think he still goes to them.  I don't go to
 4    them anymore, but I think Peter still goes to them as
 5    far as I know.
 6         Q    I asked where you worked with Peter, but I
 7    didn't ask who your employers were at each facility.  Do
 8    you remember who your employer was at the Polaroid in
 9    Cambridge when you worked there with Peter?
10         A    Thermal Insulation, I think it was.  And
11    International Paper I think was Powerhouse Equipment.
12    It was a new outfit in our area at the time.
13         Q    Was Thermal Insulation your employer at both
14    Polaroid facilities?
15         A    Yes, um-hum.
16         Q    And how about the general contractors?  Do you
17    remember the general contractors at any of the three
18    facilities that you worked with Peter at?
19         A    Geez, I forget.
20         Q    Okay.
21         A    I can't remember.
22              MR. KENNY:  Okay.  All right, sir.  Those are
23         all the questions I have for you.  Thank you very
24         much for your time, and I'll let some other folks
0077
 1         in the room ask.
 2              THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.  Okay.
 3              MS. HOCKMEYER:  Can you hear me okay from
 4         here?
 5              THE WITNESS:  I can.
 6              MS. HOCKMEYER:  I'll speak up.
 7              THE WITNESS:  Okay.
 8              MS. HOCKMEYER:  It's easier.  My computer's
 9         here.
10                       CROSS EXAMINATION
11    BY MS. HOCKMEYER:
12         Q    Okay.  So I just want to focus on
13    International Paper for a little bit with you?
14         A    Um-hum.
15         Q    I'll pick up right where Ryan just left off.
16    You said you don't recall any of the general
17    contractors.  Does the name Walsh Construction remind
18    you of whether or not Walsh Construction was the general
19    contractor in 1976?
20         A    The only job I remember Walsh Construction was
21    Mass. General Hospital in Boston.  I don't remember them
22    being up there in Maine.
23         Q    Okay.  Do you recall the names of -- do you
24    recall the name of who Fred McGovern's boss was on the
0078
 1    job?
 2         A    Like I say, it was a new outfit.  I think they
 3    were out of Ohio, actually, and I met him one time, and
 4    I don't recall his name.  He wasn't out of our -- the
 5    Boston area.  It wasn't one of our Boston shops, like
 6    New England Insulation or any of the other ones, you
 7    know.
 8         Q    Was this person someone from Powerhouse
 9    Equipment?
10         A    Yeah.  He -- yeah.  He wasn't on the job all
11    the time.  He was just, like, their outside super, I
12    guess, or the owner of the company.  I'm not sure which,
13    but he'd show up every once in a while, and we would
14    have no dealings with him, actually.
15         Q    Fair to say that Peter took his daily orders
16    from Fred?
17         A    I would say so, yeah.  We all did, actually,
18    you know, one way or the other.
19         Q    Did you take orders from Fred or from Peter?
20         A    Both.
21         Q    Did it just vary on a given day or was there a
22    time frame where it switched from Fred giving you orders
23    to now Peter giving you orders?
24         A    Well, sometimes Fred would take off a little
0079
 1    early, and Peter would take over for him, so he would
 2    be, like, more or less the boss boss, you know.
 3         Q    Was this because Peter was the senior
 4    journeyman on the site after Fred would leave?
 5         A    No.  No.
 6         Q    Just worked out this way?
 7         A    Yeah, just -- yeah.
 8         Q    When Peter would be the person who would fill
 9    in the role of foreman, would he then transition into
10    less hands-on work and more directional --
11         A    Yeah.  He would do less.
12         Q    -- work?
13         A    Yeah, he would do a little less work.
14         Q    Are you able to approximate for me of the
15    three to four months that you were at this site together
16    what percent of the time Peter was directing work as
17    your foreman versus doing hands-on work himself?
18         A    He was mostly hands-on work, you know.  I
19    would say, you know, three quarters of the time he was
20    hands on.
21         Q    Do you recall taking orders from anybody aside
22    from Fred and Peter while you worked at International
23    Paper?
24         A    No, I don't.
0080
 1         Q    Do you recall ever taking orders from any
 2    general contractor on the site even if you can't tell me
 3    who they were?
 4         A    They don't have anything to do with us.  They
 5    tell -- if they have a problem, they go to Fred who is
 6    the supervisor.  We don't -- we didn't have any dealings
 7    with the -- as a worker, had no dealings with the
 8    general contractor.
 9         Q    Would the same be true for International Paper
10    in that you would have no dealings with anybody from
11    International Paper?
12         A    Right.
13         Q    And nobody from International Paper would
14    direct you how to do your job?
15         A    No.
16         Q    When you wanted to access the facility, drive
17    in, do you recall whether or not there was a guard shack
18    that you had to go to and check in?
19         A    There was, yeah, uh-hum.
20         Q    And did you have to get a visitor's badge or
21    some kind of an emblem to wear?
22         A    Let me think now.  You know, I forget, but we
23    may have, but I can't remember right offhand.
24         Q    Do you recall whether or not Powerhouse
0081
 1    Equipment set up a trailer on the site for you to go and
 2    congregate with your crew?
 3         A    Let me think of that too.  Some of them did,
 4    and some of them didn't.  I think they did, as far as I
 5    can recall.
 6         Q    And this was a new construction job?
 7         A    Yeah.
 8         Q    New insulation jobs?
 9         A    Um-hum.
10         Q    So all the materials had to be -- yes?  You
11    said "um-hum."
12         A    Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry.
13         Q    So all the materials had to be supplied to the
14    site for you to do your job?
15         A    Yes.
16         Q    Do you remember who supplied the materials?
17         A    I don't.  I really don't.  I know before when
18    I was -- some of them would come by train, train cars
19    loaded with stock, you know.
20         Q    But do you have any memory of a train car
21    coming to International Paper?
22         A    Not to this job I don't recall specifically.
23         Q    Okay.
24         A    But mostly trailer trucks.
0082
 1         Q    Understanding that you don't know who the
 2    supplier was of the materials, do you have a memory of
 3    the materials arriving when you were there?
 4         A    Yeah.
 5         Q    Do you know who was responsible for ordering
 6    the materials that you used?
 7         A    Usually they have an estimator on the job.  So
 8    when the job starts, they know what you're going to
 9    start doing first, and they would order that stock so
10    there's not just an overload of stock on the job.  So
11    they order it as they -- as it progressed.  So probably
12    Fred would -- you know, once we would get -- say, we had
13    to go from here to there, once we get there or close to
14    there, he'd call and order stock for the next section,
15    the next part, you know.  So, in other words, the stock
16    for the whole job wasn't there at one time.
17         Q    Understood.  So this estimator, would this be
18    somebody that would be hired or working with Powerhouse
19    Equipment to determine how much stock was needed and who
20    would supply it?
21         A    The way I understand, when they bid a job, the
22    estimator estimates the amount of material and the
23    amount of time it should take to do that job too.  So he
24    would work for Powerhouse Equipment.
0083
 1         Q    Did anybody inspect your work?
 2         A    I imagine people from the plant, you know, to
 3    make sure it was all right, I guess.
 4         Q    Did Peter inspect your work?
 5         A    Not really, no.
 6         Q    Fair to say that the boiler room or powerhouse
 7    was shut down when you were doing your work?
 8         A    Yeah.
 9              MS. HOCKMEYER:  I think those are all my
10         questions.
11              THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Thank you.
12              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
13                       CROSS EXAMINATION
14    BY MR. LYNCH:
15         Q    Good morning, Mr. Donovan.
16         A    Good morning.
17         Q    Frank Lynch.
18         A    Nice to meet you.
19         Q    Thank you for coming.  We appreciate the time.
20         A    My pleasure.
21         Q    You're familiar with Cleaver-Brooks boilers?
22         A    Um-hum.
23              MR. HUMEN:  Yes.
24         A    Yes.  Jesus Christ.
0084
 1    BY MR. LYNCH:
 2         Q    You agree with me that they're what they call
 3    a prepackaged-type boiler that comes in on a truck or a
 4    railcar, that type of thing?
 5         A    I think you're right.  I think so.
 6         Q    Okay.  Hopefully a simple question for you,
 7    the jobsites that we've discussed where you worked
 8    either with Peter or around Peter on the same job --
 9         A    Uh-hum.
10         Q    -- would you agree with me that those jobsites
11    did not involve Cleaver-Brooks boilers?
12         A    I would say they did not involve them.
13         Q    That's what I thought.
14         A    I don't think so, yeah.
15         Q    Okay.  On one of your lists -- and we
16    certainly appreciate your bringing these.  It's easier
17    when you are going back so far in time.
18         A    Um-hum.
19         Q    Exhibit Number 2, I think you wrote in Thermal
20    next to the two Polaroids?
21         A    Yeah.
22         Q    Okay.  So just so we all understand that you
23    were employed by Thermal?
24         A    Thermal Insulation, yeah.
0085
 1         Q    Okay.  And that's an insulation contractor;
 2    right?
 3         A    Yes.  Um-hum.
 4         Q    An Peter Crescenzo was also employed by
 5    Thermal Insulation?
 6         A    Yes.
 7         Q    And for the two Polaroid jobs that you worked
 8    with Peter, you were both employed by Thermal; correct?
 9         A    Yes, yeah, correct.
10         Q    And on this list it says -- it's under 1968,
11    the two Polaroid jobs; is that correct?
12         A    Yeah.
13         Q    Is that your memory?
14         A    Yes.
15         Q    So it was 1968 that you think you worked with
16    Peter for both jobs?
17         A    Yes.
18         Q    All right.  You didn't work for Thermal very
19    long, did you?
20         A    No.  No, not at all.
21         Q    Okay.  Do you recall exactly how long it was?
22         A    Geez.  Probably just months, maybe.
23         Q    Okay.  You know, you have a great memory.  I
24    got to tell you.
0086
 1         A    Well, I'm trying to -- as far as I can
 2    remember.  That's all I can say.
 3         Q    No.  And that's the best you can do.  Have you
 4    seen your Social Security record --
 5         A    I have.
 6         Q    -- recently?
 7         A    No.
 8         Q    Why don't you take a look at this?
 9         A    How did you get that?
10         Q    You made a claim by the Thornton Law Firm
11    years and years ago, and it got produced in that case.
12         A    Oh.  Are you allowed to have this?
13         Q    Oh, yeah.
14         A    So what do you want me to look at?
15         Q    Okay.  Have you seen your Social Security
16    printouts before?  You've seen documents like this?
17         A    I don't recall ever seeing one.
18         Q    Okay.  Let me -- I'll pick out the page for
19    you because all I want to do is talk about your
20    employment with Thermal.  I had it right here a minute
21    ago.  So I'm looking at -- it's paginated at the bottom
22    Page 5 of your Social Security record.  And then if you
23    look up here, you see Thermal Insulation Company --
24         A    Um-hum.
0087
 1         Q    -- Inc. of Braintree.  That's the company we
 2    are talking about; right?
 3         A    Yeah.
 4         Q    Okay.  And then it will give you the year, and
 5    then they break this down by quarters?
 6         A    Um-hum.
 7         Q    You see January through March, April through
 8    June?
 9         A    Yep.
10         Q    And it reports earnings for you from Thermal
11    of a little over a thousand dollars in the second
12    quarter --
13         A    Yeah.
14         Q    -- of 1968; is that correct?  At least what
15    the document says?
16         A    Yeah, I guess.
17         Q    Okay.
18         A    Yeah.
19         Q    Going for your glasses.  I want to make sure
20    you are comfortable with it.
21         A    Yeah.  That would be right, I guess.
22         Q    Okay.  So that's consistent with your memory
23    that you worked with them for two or three months or so
24    in 1968; correct?
0088
 1         A    Um-hum.  Yes.
 2         Q    And I think your memory was also good that you
 3    started probably in the spring time, April or May?
 4         A    Yeah.
 5         Q    Okay.  And worked there with Peter for a few
 6    months?
 7         A    Um-hum.
 8         Q    Yes?  That's a "yes"?
 9         A    Yes.
10         Q    And would you agree with me now looking back
11    on this and thinking this that both Polaroid jobs were
12    within that time period?
13         A    I would say so, yes.
14              MR. LYNCH:  Okay, great.  Why don't we mark
15         this?
16    BY MR. LYNCH:
17         Q    And I just have a couple more questions.
18         A    Oh.
19         Q    You can take a look at it to your heart's
20    delight.  Let Niki do her job here.
21              (Off-the-record discussion held.)
22              (Exhibit Number 4 marked for identification.)
23    BY MR. LYNCH:
24         Q    You mentioned that when you got the Asbestos
0089
 1    Worker Journal that there were some articles in there
 2    about asbestos health hazards by the Mount Sinai
 3    Hospital; right?
 4         A    Um-hum.  Yeah.
 5         Q    Did you remember the name Dr. Selikoff or
 6    Irving Selikoff?
 7         A    Dr. Irving Selikoff.
 8         Q    That's the guy; right?
 9         A    That's him.
10         Q    And you can remember Dr. Selikoff had articles
11    that were produced by the Mount Sinai Hospital that were
12    included within the Asbestos Workers Journal; correct?
13         A    I'm pretty sure, yes.
14         Q    Yeah, and they happened on a pretty regular
15    basis back in the '60s and the '70s; right?
16         A    Yeah, you're right.
17         Q    Okay.  Do you recall meeting Dr. Selikoff
18    ever?
19         A    I don't know if I ever met him.  He may have
20    been at one of our meetings.
21         Q    Yeah.
22         A    But --
23         Q    Do you remember people from the Mount Sinai
24    Hospital coming up to talk to you; right?
0090
 1         A    I don't remember.  I might not have been at
 2    that meeting.
 3         Q    Okay.
 4         A    I don't know, but I know they did.
 5         Q    You remember they came up to at least to meet
 6    with Local 6?
 7         A    Yeah.  Yeah.
 8         Q    Okay.  And the reason that they came up to
 9    meet with Local 6 was to talk about the hazards of
10    breathing in asbestos dust?
11         A    Yeah.
12         Q    And do you remember during that time period
13    that they encouraged the workers of Local 6 to do a
14    couple of things.  One was to stop smoking; right?
15         A    Oh, yeah.
16         Q    And another one was to try and avoid breathing
17    in the dust; correct?
18         A    Um-hum.  I'm sure, yeah.
19              MR. LYNCH:  Okay.  Great.  All right.  Those
20         are all the questions I have.  Thank you, sir.
21              THE WITNESS:  Okay.
22              MR. LYNCH:  I appreciate it.
23              MR. KENNY:  I just have one quick question.
24                      REDIRECT EXAMINATION
0091
 1    BY MR. KENNY:
 2         Q    When you were at International Paper and you
 3    were doing some insulation work on the boiler, you said
 4    you were using some 48 board?
 5         A    48 board.
 6         Q    Do you know what that was made of?
 7         A    Geez, it was brown.  I remember that.  Geez.
 8    It wasn't fiberglass.  I can't remember what they called
 9    it because I used it at the Bow, New Hampshire, too, the
10    same thing.  Geez.  I can't remember.  It was like a
11    little felt.  I can't remember.  I really can't.
12         Q    Fair to say it wasn't asbestos insulation?
13         A    No, it wasn't.  It was like a heavy-density
14    fiberglass.
15         Q    Okay.
16         A    It wasn't fiberglass.  It was -- I forget what
17    the heck -- but it wasn't asbestos, though.
18              MR. KENNY:  All right.  Thank you, sir.
19         That's all I have.  Does anyone on the phone have
20         any questions?
21              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  No, I don't have any.
22              MR. KENNY:  Do you have any follow-up?
23              MR. HUMEN:  No, I don't have any.
24              MR. KENNY:  Okay.
0092
 1              MR. HUMEN:  No follow-up.
 2              MR. KENNY:  Anyone else in the room?
 3              DEFENSE COUNSEL:  No.
 4              MR. KENNY:  All right.  I think we are done.
 5         Thank you.

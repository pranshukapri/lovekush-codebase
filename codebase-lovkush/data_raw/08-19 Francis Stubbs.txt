           4   A.     I -- I think it was (215)939-6469.

           5   Q.     And what was the provider?

           6   A.     T-Mobile.

           7   Q.     Were you using the cell phone in the car that day?

           8   A.     I -- I did use it just before this accident

           9   happened, but I had hung up before it happened.

          10   Q.     So you -- you made a phone call?

          11   A.     No.  My son called me, actually.

          12   Q.     Were you using the phone in any other capacity,

          13   GPS, music?

          14   A.     No, I was not.

          15   Q.     And do you have to wear glasses, sir?

          16   A.     Yes, but not to drive.

          17   Q.     Just to read?

          18   A.     For reading, uh-huh.

          19   Q.     All right.  So you said you left the warehouse,

          20   heading home.  How long after you left the warehouse did

          21   the accident occur?

          22   A.     It was about 10, 15 minutes.

          23   Q.     And what street were you on when the accident

          24   occurred?

          25   A.     I was on Route 313.
                                                                     12



           1   Q.     Are you familiar with that street?

           2   A.     Very.

           3   Q.     How often do you drive on that street?

           4   A.     I had that building for 15 years, so often.

           5   Q.     Every time you left that building, you went home?

           6   A.     I would say most of the time, I took 313, yes.

           7   Q.     Can you describe the area of Route 313 where the

           8   accident occurred.

           9   A.     Yes.  I was just past 5th Street, which is -- goes

          10   into Perkasie.  And it's a stretch -- I think it's 55

          11   miles an hour there.  And it's an open stretch before you

          12   get to Dublin.

          13   Q.     How many lanes of traffic?

          14   A.     Two.

          15   Q.     One in each direction?

          16   A.     Correct.

          17   Q.     You said, "The speed limit is 55 miles per hour."

          18   Do you know how fast you were going?

          19   A.     I was probably going 40 to 45 'cause my van was

          20   quite old.

          21   Q.     What's on either side of the street?  Is it like a

          22   residential area?  Is it --

          23   A.     Let me see.  Well, there's -- on the left, there

          24   was -- there's like a garden stand in the summer.  This

          25   wasn't summer.  But -- and there's a business and -- a
                                                                     13



           1   couple businesses.  On the right is just open fields.

           2   Q.     Is there parking on either side of the street?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     And how was the traffic that day?

           5   A.     Fairly light.

           6   Q.     Is that normal --

           7   A.     Yes --

           8   Q.      -- for that area?

           9   A.     -- at that hour.

          10   Q.     Any kind of traffic control devices like a -- a

          11   light or a stop sign or --

          12   A.     Where the accident happened?

          13   Q.     Yes.

          14   A.     No, there's not.

          15   Q.     All right.  And can you just briefly describe how

          16   this impact occurred.

          17   A.     Yeah.  I was coming down 313, heading east.  And

          18   I -- I remember seeing a car up ahead.  But as I said, it

          19   was dark and rainy.  And I just saw running lights, so I

          20   assumed the car was moving.  And it wasn't until I was

          21   almost on top of -- of Celeste Mihalo that I realized that

          22   she was stopped.

          23                  And I don't remember any emergency

          24   rights -- lights or brake lights, just running lights.

          25   And I just -- I, of course, applied the brakes, but I
                                                                     14



           1   slipped.  I mean it was skidding, and I just plowed into

           2   her tire that was on the -- she had one of those Jeeps

           3   that had the tire on the back, and I hit that tire pretty

           4   hard.

           5   Q.     And you said you did see her car.  Can you estimate

           6   time-wise?

           7   A.     I would say about five, six seconds before.

           8   Q.     And you said you couldn't tell if she was stopped

           9   or moving?

          10   A.     I could not.  I -- I assumed she was moving.

          11   Q.     And you said the only thing you saw were running

          12   lights?

          13   A.     That's correct.

          14   Q.     And how fast would you say you thought you were

          15   going?

          16   A.     Well, I was probably going 40, 45 until I hit the

          17   brakes.  And then, I don't know how fast I was going when

          18   I hit her.

          19   Q.     And how soon after you saw her did you apply the

          20   brakes?

          21   A.     Probably about three seconds.

          22   Q.     And can you describe the impact.

          23   A.     It was fairly strong.  My airbag inflated, and that

          24   was pretty awful.

          25   Q.     Just your driver side airbag?
                                                                     15



           1   A.     Correct.

           2   Q.     And where were you looking when the collision

           3   occurred?

           4   A.     Straight ahead.

           5   Q.     And you said you hit the tire on the rear of her

           6   car.  Was it completely the front of your car.  Did you

           7   hit like square on?

           8   A.     The damage was more to the right-hand side of my

           9   front -- of the front of my car -- of my van.

          10   Q.     Other than applying the brakes, did you make any

          11   other evasive maneuvers?

          12   A.     No.  There wasn't time.

          13   Q.     And after the impact, did your car move at all?

          14   A.     I tried to move it to the -- past the bridge.  It

          15   was right at a bridge, and I tried to get it off the road

          16   because I was choking, quite honestly.  I rolled down the

          17   window and there was --

          18   Q.     'Cause of the --

          19   A.     The airbags were just -- that gunpowder, whatever

          20   they put in there was -- was choking me.  And I was

          21   putting my head out the window, trying to get it off to

          22   the side, which I managed to do.  There's a driveway just

          23   past -- at 1300 Route 13.  I managed to pull off there.

          24   Q.     But once -- or right at the impact, did your car

          25   hit and stay there?
                                                                     16



           1   A.     Pretty much, yeah.

           2   Q.     And how about my client's car?

           3   A.     I think her's -- she must have been pushed forward.

           4   Q.     Did your body move at all --

           5   A.     Yeah.

           6   Q.      -- upon impact inside the car?

           7   A.     I hit that airbag pretty hard.

           8   Q.     Did you sustain any damage to your car other than

           9   the -- the airbag being deployed?

          10   A.     The car was -- the van was totaled.

          11   Q.     How about my client's car, were you able to see if

          12   she had damage?

          13   A.     Yeah.  Her -- the tire absorbed a lot of the

          14   impact.  Her battery was knocked loose, but we managed --

          15   the police actually managed to reattach that.  And I'm

          16   sure -- I'm pretty sure she was able to drive her vehicle

          17   home.

          18   Q.     So after the impact, you said you immediately tried

          19   to move to the side of the road?

          20   A.     Correct.

          21   Q.     And can you describe to me again where you were

          22   trying to move.

          23   A.     I was trying to get to a driveway that was just

          24   past the bridge where the impact occurred.  And it's -- I

          25   remember the address is 1300.
                                                                     17



           1   Q.     And after you moved your car, what did you do next?

           2   A.     Well, we got -- I got out and made sure Celeste was

           3   okay, and she seemed to be.

           4   Q.     You spoke with her?

           5   A.     Absolutely.

           6   Q.     And what did she say?

           7   A.     She was shaken up.  She said that -- well,

           8   actually, there were two witnesses to this, which I -- I

           9   did not get their name or number.  I think they called the

          10   police though, so you might be able to get it there.  And

          11   they -- and Celeste told me a couple deer had come across

          12   the road.

          13   Q.     Did you ever see the deer?

          14   A.     I did not.

          15   Q.     Are there deer commonly in that area?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Is that why she was stopped in the road?

          18   A.     Apparently, yes.  And -- and the police did remark

          19   that they saw hoof marks on the front of her car.

          20   Q.     And you said there was two witnesses at the scene.

          21   Did you speak with them?

          22   A.     Briefly.

          23   Q.     Do you remember what was said?

          24   A.     Just that they saw it all happen and that they had

          25   called the police.
                                                                     18



           1   Q.     And the police did arrive on scene?

           2   A.     After some time, yes.

           3   Q.     Can you approximate?

           4   A.     I'd say a good 15 minutes.

           5   Q.     And what were you doing in that 15 minutes?

           6   A.     I was talking to Celeste.  But then, she got on her

           7   phone and called someone.  I was just processing what had

           8   just happened.  I called my son to let him know I would be

           9   a little bit late.

          10   Q.     Did you call anybody else?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     And what happened when the police got there?

          13   A.     Well, I should correct that.  Until I called a tow

          14   truck.

          15   Q.     Okay.  What happened once the police got there?

          16   A.     They examined the cars and determined that it was

          17   an accident.  No one was cited.  No tickets were issued to

          18   either of us.  And they saw the hoof marks and chalked it

          19   up as bad luck.

          20   Q.     Was a police report made?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Have you seen that police report?

          23   A.     I don't think so.

          24   Q.     And after speaking with the police, what happened

          25   next?
                                                                     19



           1   A.     I -- I called a -- a truck -- tow service through

           2   Triple A.  And I believe Celeste left with her car.

           3   Q.     She was able to drive away from the scene?

           4   A.     If I remember correctly, yes.  I'm not 100 percent

           5   sure.

           6   Q.     And you said your van was totaled, right?

           7   A.     It was a total loss, yeah.  I didn't have

           8   collision.  It was so old.

           9   Q.     And where was it towed to?

          10   A.     To my mechanic here in Doylestown, over on -- near

          11   the airport.

          12   Q.     And how did you leave the scene?

          13   A.     In the tow truck.

          14   Q.     And did somebody pick you up from the --

          15   A.     I think I walked home from there.

          16   Q.     Other than you, Celeste, the police officer, and

          17   the -- you said there was two witnesses?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Was there anyone else on the scene?

          20   A.     Just the people who live at 1300.  They came

          21   sometime after the accident and just pulled in their

          22   driveway.  That was the only other people.

          23   Q.     Did you speak with them?

          24   A.     No, not at all.

          25   Q.     And have you ever seen any of the witnesses or my
                                                                     20



           1   client since?

           2   A.     No.  No, I haven't.

           3   Q.     How long were you on the scene?

           4   A.     I'd say about 45 minutes to an hour.

           5   Q.     Did you sustain any injuries from this accident?

           6   A.     Personal?

           7   Q.     Yes.

           8   A.     You mean physical?

           9   Q.     Yes.

          10   A.     Yes.  I hurt my right shoulder.

          11   Q.     Did you seek treatment for that injury?

          12   A.     I did.

          13   Q.     Are you still currently treating?

          14   A.     No.

          15                  MS. HUDACK:  Let me just look over this.

          16   BY MS. HUDACK:

          17   Q.     You said you -- after the impact, you moved your

          18   car to the right?

          19   A.     Correct.

          20   Q.     Did my client ever move her car?

          21   A.     I don't think so.  The battery had come

          22   disconnected, so she couldn't start it.

          23   Q.     You said that the police came and -- and reattached

          24   it?

          25   A.     I remember the police helping her reattach the
                                                                     21



           1   battery.

           2                  MS. HUDACK:  I think that's all I have.

           3                  MS. KOELSCH:  Okay.  Awesome.

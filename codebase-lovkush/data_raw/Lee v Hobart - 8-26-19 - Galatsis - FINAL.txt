10:17:21  9        Q.  How many times?

10:17:38 10        A.  Four times.

10:17:40 11        Q.  What are you looking at, Dr. Galatsis?

10:17:42 12        A.  I'm looking at my list, my testimony list

10:17:46 13  that highlights my deposition history and trial

10:17:51 14  history.

10:17:52 15        Q.  And is this a complete list of your

10:17:56 16  deposition and testimonial history?

10:17:59 17        A.  Correct.

10:17:59 18        Q.  So I see that the first case here is from

10:18:03 19  2012, and that's the Saba case.  And I believe the

10:18:10 20  last case here listed is the Nealan case from 2019.

10:18:14 21            So between 2012 and 2019, this is a list

10:18:19 22  of all the cases in which you've either been deposed

10:18:23 23  or have testified at trial?

10:18:24 24        A.  That's correct.

10:18:25 25        Q.  Okay.  And so it is a total of four


                                                                 10










10:18:28  1  depositions?

10:18:28  2        A.  Correct.

10:18:29  3        Q.  And a total of two trials?

10:18:31  4        A.  Correct.

10:18:32  5        Q.  And there were two depositions in the Saba

10:18:37  6  case?

10:18:37  7        A.  Correct.

10:18:38  8        Q.  And you were deposed and went to trial in

10:18:41  9  the Maciel versus Anderson case, the last two

10:18:51 10  entries?

10:18:53 11        A.  In that situation -- yes, that's correct.

10:18:56 12  Yes.

10:18:58 13            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Let me go ahead and

10:19:00 14  enter this document as Exhibit 1.  You already have

10:19:09 15  it.  I'll just enter it.  We may come back to it

10:19:11 16  later.

         17            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 1 was

         18            marked for identification by the

         19            deposition reporter and is attached

         20            hereto.)

         21  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:19:12 22        Q.  You're generally familiar with the

10:19:14 23  deposition process, I take it?

10:19:15 24        A.  Yes.

10:19:15 25        Q.  So in that case, I'm not going to give you


                                                                 11










10:19:19  1  my usual lengthy admonitions, other than to say are

10:19:22  2  you taking any medications today that would in any

10:19:27  3  way impair you offering truthful testimony today?

10:19:29  4        A.  No.

10:19:30  5        Q.  So you understand that you're under oath

10:19:31  6  and the testimony you're going to give in front of

10:19:35  7  us today is like testifying before a judge and jury;

10:19:39  8  is that correct?

10:19:39  9        A.  Yes.

10:19:39 10        Q.  Okay.  So Kristi here is going to be our

10:19:43 11  court reporter and she's got a hard job to do, so

10:19:46 12  what I request is when I ask questions, please don't

10:19:49 13  interrupt me, and I'll try not to interrupt you when

10:19:53 14  you are answering so that we have a clear record; is

10:19:54 15  that okay?

10:19:55 16        A.  Yes.

10:19:55 17        Q.  All right.  And then all of your answers,

10:19:58 18  please provide verbal answers, no "uh-huhs" and, you

10:20:07 19  know, gestures and things like that.  Just try to

10:20:09 20  answer "yes," "no" in words, okay?

10:20:10 21        A.  Yes.

10:20:12 22        Q.  Okay.  And if I ask you a question and you

10:20:14 23  answer it, I'm going to assume that you understood

10:20:16 24  my question.  If you don't understand my question,

10:20:19 25  please go ahead and tell me.  I'll try to rephrase


                                                                 12










10:20:22  1  it or try to clarify it.  You're entitled to a fair

10:20:25  2  question and I will try to do my best to ask you

10:20:28  3  clear and fair questions; is that okay?

10:20:30  4        A.  Yes.

10:20:31  5        Q.  Okay.  And then if you need a break, just

10:20:33  6  let me know.  I will try as best we can to

10:20:36  7  accommodate you.  We'll try to take a break every

10:20:40  8  once in an hour or so.

10:20:43  9            Okay.  I want to start with your

10:20:46 10  background.  Perhaps what we can do is -- obviously,

10:20:52 11  you're a talented man.  I've taken a look at your CV

10:20:58 12  and you have a lot of different talents, not only in

10:21:00 13  carbon monoxide but everything else.  What I'll do

10:21:02 14  is -- let me get his declaration.

10:21:10 15            So you've got some background material in

10:21:12 16  your declaration; correct?

10:21:13 17        A.  Correct.  I believe so.

10:21:14 18        Q.  And that, I would assume, pertains to your

10:21:18 19  experience as at least this case; correct?

10:21:22 20        A.  Correct.

10:21:22 21            MR. TAYAB:  Let me go ahead and mark your

10:21:25 22  declaration as an exhibit.

10:21:25 23  ///

10:21:31  5            MR. TAYAB:  So here you go.  And you may

10:21:32  6  refer to that if you want.  That's fine.  I'm just

10:21:36  7  marking this for the record.

10:21:36  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:21:38  9        Q.  So could you go ahead and tell me a little

10:21:42 10  about your background.

10:21:46 11        A.  Absolutely.  So I have an engineering

10:21:48 12  major, undergraduate.  I have a postgraduate in

10:21:56 13  engineering, also, Ph.D., specifically in sensor

10:22:04 14  technology, specifically in developing, inventing,

10:22:09 15  testing and designing sensor technology to detect

10:22:15 16  toxic gas components.

10:22:17 17        Q.  Now, your undergraduate degree, when and

10:22:21 18  where did you earn that from?

10:22:23 19        A.  In my undergraduate degree, I earned that

10:22:26 20  at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.

10:22:35 21        Q.  In what discipline?

10:22:37 22        A.  In computer systems engineering.  That was

10:22:39 23  the major.  During that period, however, I also had

10:22:45 24  a major project that involved developing a smoke

10:22:50 25  analyzer working very intimately with a combustion


                                                                 14










10:22:54  1  burner and a stack at a private company called

10:23:01  2  Novatech Controls in Melbourne, Australia.

10:23:06  3        Q.  And this is during your undergraduate

10:23:10  4  years?

10:23:10  5        A.  That is correct.

10:23:11  6        Q.  And what time frame was that?

10:23:12  7        A.  I began my undergraduate course in 2000

10:23:25  8  and 99 -- no, excuse me.  I'll take that back.  '95

10:23:29  9  to '99, inclusive.

10:23:38 10        Q.  Okay.

10:23:38 11        A.  And my experience related to this case

10:23:41 12  working with sensor technology began three years

10:23:45 13  into that course, and as I mentioned, that involved

10:23:47 14  developing a smoke analyzer for a flue gas

10:23:57 15  environment.

10:23:57 16            And in addition, I had another project to

10:23:59 17  develop a carbon monoxide system for an automobile

10:24:03 18  that was funded by the Australian Medical

10:24:08 19  Association and the Australian government to develop

10:24:13 20  an interlock system for a vehicle to prevent exhaust

10:24:17 21  gas suicides.  Again, both projects were undertaken

10:24:22 22  at the undergraduate level.

10:24:24 23        Q.  So what did you do upon graduating from

10:24:26 24  your bachelor's program in 1999?

10:24:28 25        A.  Upon graduating, I wanted to pursue my


                                                                 15










10:24:32  1  passion for sensor technology, specifically for

10:24:35  2  toxic gas detection.  I applied for scholarship.  I

10:24:42  3  was successful.  I had a great rapport with my

10:24:45  4  supervisor at the time, and that shelved me into

10:24:48  5  working as a graduate student in the premier center

10:24:54  6  technology laboratory in Australia.

10:24:56  7        Q.  When did you complete your doctoral work?

10:25:01  8        A.  Roughly 2003, I believe it was.

10:25:06  9        Q.  And what did you do after you finished

10:25:08 10  your doctorate?

10:25:10 11        A.  After I finished my doctorate, I also

10:25:17 12  completed an MBA.  After that, I spent -- also,

10:25:23 13  during that period of time, I was still continually

10:25:25 14  working on a part-time basis for the laboratory that

10:25:29 15  I graduated from continuing these projects, and in

10:25:39 16  2005, I believe, I -- 2000 and -- let me check here

10:25:45 17  so I don't get that wrong.

10:25:47 18            MR. TAYAB:  Let me go ahead and enter your

10:25:50 19  CV as Exhibit 3 so that you can refer to it --

10:25:53 20            THE WITNESS:  Sure.  Appreciate it.

10:25:55 21            MR. TAYAB:  -- if you'd like.

10:25:57 22            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 3 was

10:25:57 23            marked for identification by the

10:25:57 24            deposition reporter and is attached

10:25:58 25            hereto.)


                                                                 16










10:25:58  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:25:58  2        Q.  Can you take a look at Exhibit 3.

10:26:00  3            Is that the most current version of your

10:26:02  4  CV?

10:26:03  5        A.  Yes.  Yes, correct.

10:26:06  6            And in 2004, I arrived into the U.S. and I

10:26:14  7  was appointed at UCLA as a -- at the time, the job

10:26:22  8  description was as a professional engineer, which

10:26:25  9  then evolved into a professorship as an adjunct

10:26:29 10  associate professor.

10:26:30 11        Q.  And so you've been an associate professor

10:26:34 12  at UCLA for how long?

10:26:36 13        A.  That lasted from 2004 through 2015.

10:26:40 14        Q.  Okay.  And then what happened after 2015?

10:26:43 15        A.  After 2015 -- 2014, 2015 time, so there

10:26:50 16  was some overlap -- we were developing some

10:26:52 17  technology with the semiconducting industry in the

10:26:57 18  U.S., names such as Intel, IBM, and we worked on a

10:27:02 19  certain specific technology related to

10:27:04 20  telecommunications and we raised some venture

10:27:07 21  funding, and we transferred that technology from the

10:27:12 22  university to a startup company in Los Angeles.

10:27:15 23        Q.  So in the 11 years that you were an

10:27:18 24  associate professor, did you work on any sensor

10:27:21 25  technologies?


                                                                 17










10:27:22  1        A.  Yes.  During that period, I parented a

10:27:26  2  very important sensor with BASF, one of the premier

10:27:30  3  chemical materials companies in Europe, with a

10:27:33  4  colleague of mine that at the time was working on

10:27:37  5  campus at UCLA.

10:27:38  6            I collaborated with numerous professors at

10:27:43  7  UCLA on sensor technology, and some of that

10:27:47  8  technology was published with various professors.

10:27:51  9  And actually, we leveraged that technology into a

10:27:57 10  very -- a different application, as I mentioned, in

10:28:00 11  telecommunications.  So the same technology we were

10:28:02 12  developing for sensing gas toxic detection, we

10:28:06 13  leveraged for a different application.

10:28:08 14        Q.  But were you doing anything related to gas

10:28:12 15  sensing between 2004 and 2015?

10:28:13 16        A.  Yes.

10:28:13 17        Q.  And were any of those efforts directed to

10:28:18 18  carbon monoxide sensors?

10:28:25 19        A.  I believe so.

10:28:28 20        Q.  And then in 2015 you became a technologist

10:28:34 21  of the school of engineering and school of

10:28:34 22  technology at UCLA?

10:28:36 23        A.  That's correct.

10:28:37 24        Q.  And what's a technologist?

10:28:39 25        A.  So at the time in 2014, I went to


                                                                 18










10:28:48  1  Carbonics as the CEO.  It was a full-time position

10:28:52  2  while my professorship was still valid at UCLA.

10:28:57  3            When that diminished and sun set, I was

10:29:01  4  converted over to a technologist and I was part of

10:29:06  5  an affiliation with the school of engineering, and

10:29:07  6  that allowed me to continue to write proposals,

10:29:10  7  obtain funding for various activities, one being I

10:29:16  8  was coordinating working groups in nanotechnology

10:29:21  9  for a certain conference, and that allowed me to

10:29:24 10  obtain funding from the National Science Foundation

10:29:28 11  and still be involved in some academic activity

10:29:32 12  whilst I was at Carbonics full time as CEO.

10:29:36 13        Q.  And Carbonics, what does it do?

10:29:38 14        A.  As I mentioned, the objective of Carbonics

10:29:42 15  is to commercialize next-generation telecommunication

10:29:48 16  technology, using the work and the technology we

10:29:51 17  invented during my time at UCLA.

10:29:54 18        Q.  Does that work involve extending battery

10:29:57 19  life and things like that?

10:29:59 20        A.  That's correct.

10:30:00 21        Q.  That's a favorite topic of mine.

10:30:02 22            What kind of batteries, just out of

10:30:04 23  curiosity?

10:30:05 24        A.  Well, what we did at Carbonics is we're

10:30:07 25  not specifically involving the battery problem; we


                                                                 19










10:30:10  1  are producing transistors and circuitry that is much

10:30:16  2  more efficient that can extend the life of

10:30:19  3  batteries.

10:30:20  4        Q.  Okay.  And then at some point in 2016, you

10:30:21  5  became a researcher with UCLA?

10:30:24  6        A.  That's correct.

10:30:24  7        Q.  Tell me what that's about.

10:30:26  8        A.  Not much different to a technologist.

10:30:29  9  It's again a non-paid position, it's an affiliation,

10:30:36 10  and that continued allowing me to submit proposals

10:30:40 11  as a non-paid affiliate of UCLA.

10:30:44 12        Q.  Okay.  At some point, you were -- you got

10:30:49 13  involved in a company called Forensic, Forensics

10:30:53 14  LLC?

10:30:53 15        A.  That's correct.

10:30:54 16        Q.  From 2000 to the present?

10:31:01 17        A.  Correct.

10:31:02 18        Q.  And what does Forensics LLC do?

10:31:06 19        A.  Over the period of working on carbon

10:31:12 20  monoxide cases that began in 2012 with the Saba

10:31:15 21  case, I was exposed and reenergized my interest in

10:31:19 22  sensing technology, or I should say further

10:31:24 23  emphasizing the importance of that in my brain

10:31:27 24  capacity.

10:31:28 25            And in 2018, again working with various


                                                                 20










10:31:34  1  cases in carbon monoxide, I saw an opportunity where

10:31:38  2  low-level carbon monoxide detection is required, and

10:31:43  3  with that entity, I began commercializing various

10:31:48  4  carbon monoxide detector products.

10:31:51  5        Q.  What sort of products?

10:31:54  6        A.  A key product is a low-level carbon

10:31:59  7  monoxide detector specifically for pilots, for

10:32:04  8  aircraft application, and it's -- there's a need, a

10:32:09  9  need where you're in a small volume of space or an

10:32:14 10  automobile or an aircraft and there is a leak coming

10:32:17 11  from somewhere, some situation is going on, and

10:32:21 12  occupants, such as moms and dads and other people

10:32:26 13  concerned about their health, typically purchase

10:32:29 14  these products and they monitor the environment.

10:32:32 15        Q.  And this is specific to carbon monoxide or

10:32:35 16  other types of gases as well?

10:32:36 17        A.  At the moment, my focus -- when we began

10:32:40 18  in 2018, the focus was specifically on carbon

10:32:44 19  monoxide, but then I saw a demand for other toxic

10:32:49 20  gases, such as ammonia, nitrogen dioxide and others.

10:32:56 21        Q.  And you said this was a low-level

10:32:59 22  detector.

10:32:59 23            What do you mean by that?

10:33:01 24        A.  So the definition of low level basically

10:33:05 25  means one will be alarmed of carbon monoxide at a


                                                                 21










10:33:09  1  low level.  Low level is less than 70 parts per

10:33:13  2  minute.  There's a demand -- a lot of people, again,

10:33:16  3  as I mentioned, folks driving vehicles, flying

10:33:21  4  planes and others, believe that being alarmed at 70

10:33:27  5  parts per million following the UL 2034 protocol

10:33:30  6  from 60 to 240 parts per million is not adequate

10:33:35  7  enough.  And there is --

10:33:36  8            MR. JARCHI:  I think you may have

10:33:40  9  misspoke.  Minutes instead of parts per million?

10:33:43 10            THE WITNESS:  Minutes.  60 to 240 minutes.

10:33:46 11  Did I say parts per million?  I apologize.

10:33:50 12            So there is a -- there are a group of

10:33:52 13  people that believe that is not adequate so there is

10:33:55 14  a demand.  There is a market demand for low-level

10:33:58 15  carbon monoxide detectors.

10:34:00 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:34:01 17        Q.  Okay.  Now, you mentioned the Saba case,

10:34:05 18  and that's listed in your list of cases as well.

10:34:09 19            Can you tell me a little bit about that

10:34:11 20  case?

10:34:11 21        A.  That was a situation where it was a home

10:34:15 22  in Arizona, and the -- both gas burning appliances,

10:34:23 23  the boiler and the furnace, were located in a small,

10:34:27 24  confined cabinet.  And what was occurring was a

10:34:34 25  backdraft situation where when the furnace was on


                                                                 22










10:34:37  1  and the water heater was on, it would suck in the

10:34:40  2  exhaust coming out from the boiler, the hot water

10:34:43  3  system, and in that situation, it was polluting and

10:34:48  4  it was polluting the inhabitants of the home.

10:34:53  5        Q.  Approximately what levels of carbon

10:34:56  6  monoxide?

10:34:56  7        A.  I don't recall.

10:34:58  8        Q.  Was it what you would consider acute?

10:35:04  9        A.  I don't recall.

10:35:07 10        Q.  Were there any immediate injuries

10:35:11 11  requiring hospitalization of the persons exposed?

10:35:14 12        A.  I don't recall.

10:35:15 13        Q.  Okay.  Did you do any sort of modeling

10:35:18 14  analysis on that case?

10:35:20 15        A.  Yes, I did.

10:35:21 16        Q.  Can you tell me a little bit about that

10:35:24 17  modeling analysis?

10:35:25 18        A.  That modeling -- that modeling analysis

10:35:28 19  was undertaken what we call based on a mass balance

10:35:33 20  model.  I employed software that's readily available

10:35:40 21  from the EPA to undertake that analysis, and that

10:35:45 22  analysis determined what a typical carbon monoxide

10:35:50 23  profile would look like in a residence over a period

10:35:55 24  of time.  I believe that period of time was over a

10:35:57 25  24-hour period, if I recall correctly.


                                                                 23










10:36:00  1        Q.  And based on that model you were able to

10:36:12  2  draw some conclusions?

10:36:14  3        A.  Correct.

10:36:15  4        Q.  And those conclusions were what?

10:36:18  5        A.  If I recall correctly, the conclusion was

10:36:22  6  that the occupants were mostly being poisoned with

10:36:27  7  carbon monoxide in the evening hours when in bed,

10:36:32  8  and the ventilation system was very close, in close

10:36:38  9  proximity to the inhabitants lying in bed, which, in

10:36:44 10  that situation, evoked a proximity situation where

10:36:48 11  the carbon monoxide was not diluting and was being

10:36:54 12  blown straight into the inhabitants' space.

10:36:59 13        Q.  Okay.  And did you perform any air flow

10:37:02 14  calculations?

10:37:05 15        A.  I believe I did not.  I believe I obtained

10:37:10 16  those inflow calculations from the appliances, and

10:37:15 17  then we input values into my model, and we made some

10:37:20 18  assumptions with regards to the air flow and

10:37:23 19  exchange ventilation of the home.

10:37:26 20        Q.  And did you also with the model determine

10:37:30 21  what the ambient concentration of the enclosed area

10:37:37 22  was within that home?

10:37:37 23        A.  Correct.  We developed a profile of carbon

10:37:41 24  monoxide with time of what that looked like, given

10:37:47 25  their daily routine within the home and some


                                                                 24










10:37:50  1  assumptions around their behaviors.

10:37:52  2        Q.  And what were the assumptions?

10:37:55  3        A.  The assumptions were lengthy, but they

10:37:59  4  considered --

10:38:00  5        Q.  Let me just --

10:38:01  6        A.  Sure.

10:38:02  7        Q.  Were the assumptions related to the

10:38:04  8  behavior of the occupants?

10:38:05  9        A.  Correct.

10:38:06 10        Q.  Okay.  I'm not interested in that.  Okay.

10:38:09 11            Did you use carbon monoxide concentration

10:38:14 12  measurements for the carbon monoxide being

10:38:17 13  discharged from the offending devices?

10:38:21 14        A.  Can you rephrase the question, please?

10:38:23 15        Q.  Did you measure the level of carbon

10:38:25 16  monoxide being released from the two devices that

10:38:29 17  you mentioned?

10:38:30 18        A.  I personally did not.

10:38:32 19        Q.  Okay.  Were measurements of carbon

10:38:35 20  monoxide releases made?

10:38:37 21        A.  Yes.

10:38:37 22        Q.  What sort of measurements were those?

10:38:40 23        A.  They were emission flue gas measurements,

10:38:44 24  COAF measurements, to be specific.

10:38:47 25        Q.  Okay.  And did you perform a similar sort


                                                                 25










10:38:57  1  of analysis in this case?

10:38:59  2        A.  No.

10:38:59  3        Q.  Okay.  So you did not do a mass balance in

10:39:03  4  this case?

10:39:03  5        A.  No.

10:39:03  6        Q.  You did not do any sort of modeling in

10:39:06  7  this case?

10:39:06  8        A.  No.

10:39:07  9        Q.  And you did not use the EPA software to

10:39:13 10  assess what the exposure would be to the individuals

10:39:16 11  in this case?

10:39:16 12        A.  That's correct.

10:39:17 13        Q.  And what's the EPA model?  Can I have the

10:39:19 14  name for that?

10:39:20 15        A.  The name I believe is IAQX.  It's again a

10:39:30 16  mass balance model.

10:39:37 17        Q.  And why did you choose not to do such an

10:39:41 18  analysis in this case?

10:39:46 19            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; form.

10:39:47 20            THE WITNESS:  In this case -- well, let me

10:39:49 21  start again.  In the Saba case, I undertook a model

10:39:55 22  effort because the defect and the situation was

10:40:01 23  changed.  They repaired the problem, and I was not

10:40:04 24  able to go in and take measurements of the ambient

10:40:11 25  environment.  That is the preferred modus operandi.


                                                                 26










10:40:15  1            The second is if that situation has

10:40:16  2  changed, which it did, then I would take whatever

10:40:19  3  parameters are available and I would put together a

10:40:23  4  model with some assumptions based on interviews,

10:40:27  5  et cetera, and various data points.

10:40:29  6            In this case, measurements were made

10:40:34  7  onsite, on location, and in my mind, that is the

10:40:41  8  gold standard in terms of having the subject

10:40:44  9  appliance, in this case, the subject of an at-hand

10:40:47 10  for measurements to be taken, hence, not requiring a

10:40:51 11  modeling effort.

10:40:52 12        Q.  So it's your view that measurements on the

10:40:57 13  subject oven in this case were taken; correct?

10:41:04 14        A.  Can you rephrase the question?

10:41:06 15        Q.  It is your view that the measurements of

10:41:09 16  carbon monoxide level from the subject oven in this

10:41:13 17  case were taken; correct?

10:41:15 18        A.  I believe the measurements taken on

10:41:17 19  September the 21st and 22nd reflect, in some limited

10:41:24 20  capacity, based on the testing on the days, the

10:41:31 21  carbon monoxide increase within the bake chamber.

10:41:37 22        Q.  Okay.  And that you considered was

10:41:39 23  adequate data to render whatever opinions you have

10:41:40 24  been engaged to render?

10:41:42 25            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,


                                                                 27










10:41:44  1  misstates the entirety of the testimony.

10:41:46  2            THE WITNESS:  That, including testimony

10:41:47  3  from plaintiffs, including various data points that

10:41:53  4  a CO detector also is alarming, that, including

10:41:59  5  other testimony from defense and various other

10:42:03  6  material that I've been provided.

10:42:06  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:42:07  8        Q.  In addition to the data points on the

10:42:10  9  carbon monoxide levels?

10:42:12 10        A.  Correct.

10:42:12 11        Q.  Okay.  We'll get back to that in a little

10:42:23 12  bit.

10:42:24 13            Are you involved with a company called

10:42:27 14  Carbon Monoxide Forensics?  We were talking about

10:42:31 15  Forensics LLC, but I saw in your invoice that

10:42:33 16  there's another company called Carbon Monoxide

10:42:36 17  Forensics LLC.

10:42:37 18            Can you tell me a little bit about that?

10:42:39 19        A.  Sure.  Carbon Monoxide Forensics is a

10:42:42 20  d.b.a.  I'm the sole proprietor.  So, effectively,

10:42:48 21  my consulting work as a witness, my work, I

10:42:50 22  typically run under that umbrella.  Since I'm a sole

10:42:56 23  proprietor, it isn't an LLC entity.

10:43:03 24        Q.  And it is exclusively for your consulting

10:43:06 25  practice --


                                                                 28










10:43:07  1        A.  Correct.

10:43:07  2        Q.  -- your litigation consulting practice?

10:43:09  3        A.  Correct.

10:43:10  4        Q.  And then I noticed another name called

10:43:13  5  Pacific Coast Research LLC.  Some of the bills were

10:43:17  6  sent under that name.

10:43:18  7        A.  That's correct.  That also merged now into

10:43:21  8  Carbon Monoxide Forensics.

10:43:22  9        Q.  Okay.  And was that a d.b.a. as well --

10:43:26 10        A.  Yes.

10:43:27 11        Q.  -- for your litigation consulting

10:43:28 12  practice?

10:43:29 13        A.  Correct.

10:43:29 14        Q.  Okay.  And so Forensics LLC, Pacific Coast

10:43:34 15  LLC are both now Carbon Monoxide Forensics LLC; is

10:43:38 16  that correct?

10:43:38 17        A.  No, it's not, because Pacific Coast

10:43:41 18  Research was not an LLC; it was a d.b.a.

10:43:44 19        Q.  Okay.  All right.  Do you hold any

10:43:48 20  licenses or certifications?

10:43:53 21        A.  No.

10:43:54 22        Q.  Are you a licensed professional engineer,

10:43:57 23  for example?

10:43:58 24        A.  No.

10:44:01 25        Q.  Any licenses or certifications as it


                                                                 29










10:44:04  1  relates to carbon monoxide issues?

10:44:07  2        A.  There's none that I'm aware.

10:44:11  3        Q.  Okay.  Now let's talk a little bit about

10:44:14  4  your publication history.  In your CV, there are a

10:44:21  5  list of publications.

10:44:22  6            Approximately how many peer-reviewed

10:44:25  7  publications have you published?

10:44:33  8        A.  I didn't keep a count, but I would say

10:44:37  9  over a hundred.

10:44:37 10        Q.  And if you were to estimate, how many of

10:44:40 11  them would relate to carbon monoxide issues?

10:44:47 12        A.  At least 20 to 30 percent.

10:44:51 13        Q.  And out of those 20 to 30 percent, which

10:44:55 14  ones would you say would be most pertinent to the

10:44:58 15  issues in this case?

10:44:59 16            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, vague, form.

10:45:02 17            THE WITNESS:  Well, 20 to 30 percent are

10:45:05 18  related to carbon monoxide; hence, I would -- this

10:45:07 19  is a carbon monoxide case, and I would map that onto

10:45:11 20  your question.

10:45:12 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:45:12 22        Q.  Are you going to rely on those 20 to

10:45:15 23  30 percent of the publications in rendering your

10:45:18 24  opinions in this case?

10:45:18 25            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.


                                                                 30










10:45:21  1            THE WITNESS:  Possibly some of them.

10:45:22  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:45:23  3        Q.  Okay.  Now, you have listed here on Page 3

10:45:28  4  of your CV selected journal publications, and there

10:45:35  5  are three articles there.

10:45:37  6            Is there any particular reason why you've

10:45:40  7  listed and selected journal publications?

10:45:43  8        A.  No reason.

10:45:44  9        Q.  Okay.  Now the third one there,

10:45:49 10  "Engineering evidence for carbon monoxide toxicity

10:45:53 11  cases," is that a paper you wrote in 2015?

10:45:56 12        A.  Yes.

10:45:58 13        Q.  And where was that paper written?

10:46:01 14        A.  Medicine Science and the Law Journal.

10:46:03 15        Q.  Is that a peer-reviewed journal?

10:46:06 16        A.  Yes.

10:46:06 17        Q.  And would you consider that an

10:46:08 18  authoritative text?

10:46:10 19        A.  I believe so.

10:46:10 20        Q.  Has it been cited before?

10:46:12 21        A.  I'm not sure.

10:46:14 22        Q.  Okay.  We'll do that later.

10:46:38 23            Now, in approximately how many cases have

10:46:40 24  you served as an expert?  I know you've testified in

10:46:43 25  a number of them, but how many have you served as an


                                                                 31










10:46:46  1  expert witness?

10:46:47  2        A.  Approximately 25.

10:46:48  3        Q.  And how many are you currently serving on

10:46:54  4  as an expert?

10:46:55  5        A.  Approximately eight.

10:46:58  6        Q.  And other than this case, are there any

10:47:01  7  others that relate to carbon monoxide issues?

10:47:04  8        A.  All of the others relate to carbon

10:47:07  9  monoxide issues.

10:47:08 10        Q.  Okay.  And they all relate to injuries

10:47:12 11  associated with carbon monoxide exposure?

10:47:23 12        A.  Most of them, yes.

10:47:27 13        Q.  And are those cases related to residential

10:47:32 14  incidences or industrial or hotels?  Can you give me

10:47:36 15  some sense of that?

10:47:37 16        A.  All of the above.

10:47:38 17        Q.  Okay.  Some residential, I take it?

10:47:40 18        A.  Correct.  Some residential, some

10:47:43 19  commercial.

10:47:44 20        Q.  Okay.  Any of them relate to bakeries?

10:47:47 21        A.  No.

10:47:48 22        Q.  Any related to food equipment?

10:47:51 23        A.  No.

10:47:52 24        Q.  Any related to ovens?

10:48:00 25        A.  A residential oven at the moment.


                                                                 32










10:48:02  1        Q.  As in an oven in a kitchen?

10:48:07  2        A.  That's correct.

10:48:08  3        Q.  But no commercial oven such as the oven in

10:48:12  4  this case?

10:48:12  5        A.  Correct.

10:48:12  6        Q.  And any of those cases relate to heat

10:48:16  7  exchanger issues?

10:48:18  8        A.  No.

10:48:19  9        Q.  Have you ever worked in a case involving

10:48:23 10  heat exchangers?

10:48:27 11        A.  I've worked on a case that -- no.

10:48:30 12        Q.  So this is your first case involving heat

10:48:35 13  exchangers and bakery equipment?

10:48:39 14        A.  Correct.

10:48:39 15        Q.  Now, have you ever worked in a carbon

10:48:49 16  monoxide case that involves exposure over a

10:48:50 17  protracted period of time?

10:48:52 18            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

10:48:54 19            THE WITNESS:  What's your definition of

10:48:56 20  "protracted"?

10:48:57 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:48:57 22        Q.  Over, say, a lengthy period of time.

10:48:59 23            MR. JARCHI:  Same --

10:49:00 24            MR. TAYAB:  Months, years.

10:49:01 25            MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.


                                                                 33










10:49:06  1            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

10:49:06  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:49:07  3        Q.  And can you give me a sense of what type

10:49:10  4  of exposure?

10:49:11  5        A.  Absolutely.  You mentioned -- the Saba

10:49:15  6  case was over a protracted period of time, months.

10:49:19  7        Q.  Okay.

10:49:19  8        A.  I'm involved the Ford Explorer cases,

10:49:24  9  carbon monoxide leaking in the vehicle cabin, also

10:49:31 10  including behaviors over a lengthy period of time.

10:49:38 11        Q.  Okay.  And any cases involving chronic

10:49:45 12  exposures?

10:49:46 13            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

10:49:56 14            THE WITNESS:  Yes --

10:49:56 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:49:56 16        Q.  Sorry.  Go ahead.

10:49:59 17        A.  -- similarly.

10:50:00 18        Q.  What's your understanding of the term

10:50:02 19  "chronic exposure to carbon monoxide"?

10:50:04 20            MR. JARCHI:  Vague.  Vague as to form.

10:50:12 21            THE WITNESS:  Chronic to me would mean it

10:50:15 22  is sustained over some period of time beyond a day.

10:50:21 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:50:21 24        Q.  And regardless of the level of exposure?

10:50:25 25        A.  That would all be -- have to be


                                                                 34










10:50:28  1  considered.  I'm not a toxicologist to start making

10:50:34  2  those demarcations with regards to exposure and how

10:50:38  3  it influences one's health, so that's probably going

10:50:42  4  beyond the scope of the subject of my expertise.

10:50:47  5        Q.  Now, let's talk about when you first came

10:50:49  6  to be involved in this case.

10:50:52  7            When were you first approached on this

10:50:55  8  case?  Are you looking for your invoices?

10:51:05  9        A.  No, I'm looking for a notation.  I believe

10:51:08 10  it was 2016.  2016, I believe, if I'm not mistaken.

10:51:12 11        Q.  Would it help if we enter your invoices?

10:51:27 12        A.  Actually, it's in my Materials Reviewed.

10:51:33 13  Date retained, July 30, 2016.

10:51:42 14        Q.  Okay.  So you said July 2016.

10:51:46 15        A.  That's correct.

10:51:47 16        Q.  Who contacted you?

10:51:51 17        A.  My memory does not serve me well.  I'm not

10:51:56 18  sure.

10:51:57 19        Q.  Was it Mr. Jarchi?

10:51:59 20        A.  I'm not sure if it was Mr. Jarchi or his

10:52:03 21  paralegal or his office or some other personnel.

10:52:06 22        Q.  Okay.  And how is it that they came to

10:52:08 23  contact you?  How did they know to contact you?

10:52:10 24        A.  I'm not sure.  I presume I may have been

10:52:14 25  recommended by somebody, so I'm not sure.


                                                                 35










10:52:17  1        Q.  Have you worked with Mr. Jarchi before?

10:52:20  2        A.  No.

10:52:20  3        Q.  Have you worked with his firm before?

10:52:22  4        A.  Yes.

10:52:23  5        Q.  Who at this firm?

10:52:24  6        A.  There is an attorney called Christine

10:52:30  7  Spagnoli, and we worked on a case together several

10:52:35  8  years prior.

10:52:36  9        Q.  And was that a carbon monoxide case?

10:52:38 10        A.  Yes.

10:52:39 11        Q.  Okay.  And you were representing the

10:52:43 12  defense side or the plaintiff's side in that case?

10:52:48 13        A.  Defense side.

10:52:49 14        Q.  Do you recall what the outcome was?

10:52:51 15        A.  No, I do not.

10:52:59 16        Q.  And you say you do not recall anything

10:53:01 17  about your first meeting with respect to this case?

10:53:06 18        A.  My first contact or my first meeting?

10:53:08 19        Q.  Contact.  I'm not very precise there.

10:53:10 20  Sorry about that.

10:53:11 21        A.  No, I don't.

10:53:12 22        Q.  What about the first meeting as it relates

10:53:14 23  to this case?

10:53:17 24        A.  I cannot, unfortunately.

10:53:21 25        Q.  Any idea who you met with?


                                                                 36










10:53:25  1        A.  I know I met with and spoke with

10:53:28  2  Mr. Jarchi, but in terms of when that occurred, I'm

10:53:36  3  not sure.

10:53:38  4            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Why don't we go ahead

10:53:40  5  and enter your invoices as Exhibit 4.  Perhaps that

10:53:44  6  will refresh your recollection.

10:53:46  7            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 4 was

10:53:46  8            marked for identification by the

10:53:46  9            deposition reporter and is attached

10:53:46 10            hereto.)

10:53:46 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:53:53 12        Q.  Is Exhibit 4 a true and correct copy of

10:53:55 13  your invoices in this case?

10:53:56 14        A.  Yes.

10:54:01 15        Q.  So your invoice from July just says

10:54:05 16  Retainer.  I take it that you did no work in July on

10:54:10 17  this case.

10:54:11 18        A.  That's correct.  I typically obtain a

10:54:14 19  retainer and, yes, that's correct.

10:54:16 20        Q.  Okay.  And then on the 18th of August, I

10:54:26 21  see here that you had a call with Mr. Jarchi for an

10:54:30 22  hour and 15 minutes; is that correct?

10:54:32 23        A.  That's correct.

10:54:32 24        Q.  Do you recall what you discussed in that

10:54:34 25  meeting?


                                                                 37










10:54:35  1        A.  I recall we discussed the data set coming

10:54:37  2  from September 21st and 22nd of 2010.

10:54:47  3        Q.  When you say "data set," can you be more

10:54:52  4  specific?

10:54:52  5        A.  Sure.  There were measurements taken at

10:54:55  6  the supermarket, in the bakery, of the subject oven,

10:55:00  7  and there is data obtained from that inspection.

10:55:06  8        Q.  And who took those measurements?

10:55:14  9        A.  I believe there was a Mr. Brignola taking

10:55:23 10  measurements --

10:55:23 11        Q.  Okay.

10:55:24 12        A.  -- and a Mr. Bertoch taking measurements.

10:55:29 13        Q.  Anybody else?

10:55:37 14        A.  That's basically it.

10:55:38 15        Q.  And what were you provided of

10:55:42 16  Mr. Brignola's data?

10:55:45 17        A.  Mr. Brignola's data -- at that time?

10:55:48 18        Q.  At that time.

10:55:50 19        A.  I believe I was provided some photographs,

10:55:57 20  if I'm not mistaken, and some notes, if I'm not

10:56:03 21  mistaken, yes.

10:56:05 22        Q.  Were these handwritten notes?

10:56:13 23        A.  That's correct.

10:56:13 24        Q.  Were there any data downloads?

10:56:16 25        A.  From?


                                                                 38










10:56:17  1        Q.  From Mr. Brignola's work?

10:56:20  2        A.  At this time?

10:56:21  3        Q.  At that time.

10:56:22  4        A.  I don't believe there was.

10:56:24  5        Q.  Okay.  So as far as you can recall, it was

10:56:27  6  certain photographs and handwritten notes?

10:56:29  7        A.  That's correct.

10:56:30  8        Q.  Any declarations?

10:56:33  9        A.  From Mr. Brignola, specifically?  No.

10:56:40 10        Q.  Okay.  And what about Mr. Bertoch in

10:56:46 11  August of 2016?

10:56:47 12        A.  I was provided with his instrument

10:56:51 13  download data set.

10:56:52 14        Q.  Okay.  Anything else?

10:56:59 15        A.  I was also provided with his notes.

10:57:04 16        Q.  Anything else?

10:57:11 17        A.  I believe that was it at that point in

10:57:13 18  time.

10:57:14 19        Q.  Okay.  And what were you initially told

10:57:17 20  about the facts of this case?

10:57:21 21        A.  Just the key points; that there is a

10:57:25 22  subject oven in a bakery in a supermarket that has

10:57:36 23  a -- that the instrument or the appliance is

10:57:41 24  allowing carbon monoxide flue gases to enter into

10:57:46 25  the bake chamber via the heat exchanger, and to look


                                                                 39










10:57:52  1  at that situation with regard to the data that has

10:57:56  2  been provided.

10:57:57  3        Q.  Okay.  And did you form any impressions

10:58:01  4  after that first meeting with Mr. Jarchi where this

10:58:05  5  data was discussed?

10:58:07  6        A.  Not that I recall.

10:58:08  7        Q.  Okay.  And did you place any reliance on

10:58:11  8  that data that you looked at at that point in time?

10:58:15  9        A.  At that point in time --

10:58:17 10            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

10:58:17 11            THE WITNESS:  At that point in time, I

10:58:20 12  probably didn't have any conclusion or analysis.

10:58:23 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:58:23 14        Q.  Okay.  And were there any particular facts

10:58:27 15  that were important to you from that meeting that

10:58:29 16  you took away with you?

10:58:31 17            MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, argumentative,

10:58:33 18  vague and ambiguous, object to form.

10:58:36 19            THE WITNESS:  At that point in time, not

10:58:38 20  that I recall.

10:58:38 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

10:58:39 22        Q.  Okay.  And did you take -- did you make

10:58:42 23  the decision to take on the engagement after that

10:58:45 24  initial meeting?

10:58:46 25        A.  I believe so.


                                                                 40










10:58:47  1        Q.  Okay.  And what led you to do that?

10:58:50  2        A.  Most likely at the time -- I do not recall

10:58:54  3  specifically, but most likely, I felt I can

10:58:58  4  contribute in analyzing data, in analyzing the

10:59:01  5  situation and adding value and understanding of

10:59:03  6  what's going on.

10:59:04  7        Q.  Okay.  And then what did you do after that

10:59:14  8  initial meeting?

10:59:16  9        A.  I believe the sequence of events was that

10:59:21 10  I analyzed the data set that was provided.  I looked

10:59:27 11  at it, tried to decipher what was occurring during

10:59:31 12  the September 21st, 22nd measurement period.  I had

10:59:36 13  some questions regarding the instrumentation.  I

10:59:43 14  made some calls to TSI to clarify the instrument's

10:59:48 15  operation, and I believe from then on I was provided

10:59:52 16  with more material in terms of testimony to analyze

10:59:58 17  and review.

10:59:59 18        Q.  And do you recall what sort of materials

11:00:03 19  you were provided?

11:00:04 20        A.  I was provided with the materials that I

11:00:07 21  provided you a list of in 2016, which were numerous

11:00:13 22  materials, deposition, photographs and others that

11:00:17 23  are listed in 2016.

11:00:27 24            MR. TAYAB:  Let me enter Exhibit 5.

11:00:27 25  ///


                                                                 41










11:00:29  1            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 5 was

11:00:29  2            marked for identification by the

11:00:29  3            deposition reporter and is attached

11:00:29  4            hereto.)

11:00:29  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:00:31  6        Q.  Is that the document you're referring to?

11:00:33  7        A.  Yes, correct.

11:01:19  8        Q.  So in August of 2016 you were provided

11:01:24  9  with all of this material that's listed in

11:01:29 10  Exhibit 5; is that correct?

11:01:31 11        A.  Correct.

11:01:31 12        Q.  So these were case documents such as the

11:01:38 13  complaint filed by the plaintiffs?

11:01:40 14        A.  Correct.

11:01:41 15        Q.  Certain manuals?

11:01:44 16        A.  Yes.

11:01:44 17        Q.  Did you review each of these manuals that

11:01:48 18  were provided to you?

11:01:51 19        A.  Correct.

11:01:51 20        Q.  And there were certain depositions that

11:01:56 21  were provided to you?

11:01:56 22        A.  Yes.

11:01:58 23        Q.  And did you review all of those materials?

11:02:01 24        A.  Yes.

11:02:01 25        Q.  And I see that there are six depositions


                                                                 42










11:02:06  1  there of the plaintiffs; is that correct?

11:02:09  2        A.  Correct.

11:02:09  3        Q.  And then there are four depositions of --

11:02:14  4  from the defense side.

11:02:16  5            Did you review those as well?

11:02:18  6        A.  Yes.

11:02:18  7        Q.  Did you review them yourself?

11:02:20  8        A.  Yes.

11:02:21  9        Q.  In their entirety?

11:02:22 10        A.  Yes.

11:02:23 11        Q.  And then there were certain photographs

11:02:25 12  that were sent to you of the various inspections

11:02:28 13  that were done.

11:02:29 14            Did you review those as well?

11:02:31 15        A.  Yes.

11:02:32 16        Q.  I've got a question here.  Under the

11:02:36 17  Photograph 5e, there's a notation for JVF.

11:02:42 18            What's JVF?

11:02:58 19        A.  I presume that would be some photographs

11:03:06 20  taken during the inspection at Santa Maria, since

11:03:15 21  it's -- and that's August 28th.  I'm not sure at

11:03:19 22  this point in time.

11:03:19 23        Q.  Yeah.  It says August 28th of 2012, so

11:03:23 24  that's why I -- I don't know what that is.

11:03:30 25        A.  I don't recall either.


                                                                 43










11:03:38  1        Q.  And then on the next page under h, you

11:03:41  2  have an article by Richard Karg.

11:03:44  3            Why did you review that article?

11:03:48  4        A.  This is a preeminent article regarding

11:03:53  5  carbon monoxide air-free measurements.

11:04:00  6        Q.  Did you say preeminent?

11:04:02  7        A.  Yes.

11:04:03  8        Q.  Do you know where it's published?

11:04:05  9        A.  It is published on the Web.

11:04:07 10        Q.  Is it a peer-reviewed article?

11:04:09 11        A.  The same article was also published in

11:04:11 12  Dr. Penney's book.

11:04:13 13        Q.  Is Dr. Penney's book peer-reviewed?

11:04:16 14        A.  I don't believe so.

11:04:17 15        Q.  And what do you mean by "preeminent"?

11:04:22 16        A.  I mean that it is an important summary of

11:04:26 17  topic of carbon monoxide air-free measurements.

11:04:32 18        Q.  And you relied upon that article to

11:04:37 19  refresh or learn about issues related to carbon

11:04:41 20  monoxide air-free issues?

11:04:45 21        A.  Partly, yes.

11:04:46 22        Q.  And then you list your own article from

11:04:49 23  2015 that we talked about earlier.

11:04:51 24            Any particular reason why you reviewed

11:04:54 25  that article in connection with this effort?


                                                                 44










11:04:56  1        A.  No.

11:04:56  2        Q.  Okay.  And you reviewed all of this

11:05:05  3  material -- was it in August?

11:05:15  4        A.  September 30th.

11:05:16  5        Q.  So through September 30th?

11:05:18  6        A.  Yes.

11:05:19  7        Q.  And then in October you worked on drafting

11:05:30  8  the declaration that you ultimately submitted on

11:05:34  9  November 2nd of 2016?

11:05:36 10        A.  Seems like it, yes.

11:05:38 11        Q.  Okay.  So you spent a total of about 59

11:05:42 12  hours in reviewing materials and drafting your

11:05:46 13  declaration?

11:05:46 14        A.  Sounds about right, yes.

11:05:49 15        Q.  What's your hourly rate?

11:05:58 16        A.  It's changed over the few years that we've

11:06:01 17  been here, but at the moment it's $490.

11:06:05 18        Q.  490?

11:06:06 19        A.  Correct.

11:06:06 20        Q.  And when you first got engaged, it was a

11:06:09 21  different number?

11:06:13 22        A.  I believe it was 450.

11:06:17 23        Q.  And when did it change from 450 to 490?

11:06:20 24        A.  I believe that was the first of 2018, if I

11:06:34 25  recall correctly.


                                                                 45










11:06:41  1        Q.  At the time you submitted your declaration

11:06:43  2  in 2016, did you do any work on this case, or did

11:06:49  3  you do any work from then until December of 2018?

11:06:54  4  Because I don't see any invoices in that time frame.

11:06:57  5        A.  Probably not.  If there were no invoices,

11:07:00  6  I did not work.

11:07:01  7        Q.  Okay.  So there was a 22-month break in

11:07:04  8  between your declaration and resuming your work on

11:07:08  9  this case?

11:07:08 10        A.  Quite possible.

11:07:09 11        Q.  Okay.  And then I see that there's an

11:07:11 12  invoice for two hours in December, and that was a

11:07:14 13  call with Mr. Jarchi and reviewing of the documents.

11:07:18 14            Do you recall what the call was about?

11:07:21 15        A.  Can you give me the invoice number,

11:07:23 16  please, you're looking at?

11:07:25 17        Q.  I'm looking at Invoice Number 5 to

11:07:29 18  Forensics LLC.

11:07:35 19        A.  So do I recall what we discussed August

11:07:37 20  the 13th, 2018?

11:07:38 21        Q.  Yes.

11:07:39 22        A.  I do not.

11:07:40 23        Q.  And then five days later you had a

11:07:47 24  document review and another call with Mr. Jarchi.

11:07:51 25            Any recollection as to what was discussed?


                                                                 46










11:07:52  1        A.  No.

11:08:01  2        Q.  The next invoice is from April, so I take

11:08:04  3  it no work was done in this case by you between

11:08:10  4  September of 2018 and April of 2019; is that

11:08:12  5  correct?

11:08:12  6        A.  That's correct.

11:08:13  7        Q.  And then April 14th of 2019 you resumed

11:08:18  8  work, and that was a call with Mr. Jarchi for an

11:08:22  9  hour; is that correct?

11:08:22 10        A.  Correct.

11:08:22 11        Q.  Do you recall what that call was about?

11:08:25 12        A.  No.  I'm sure it was related to some

11:08:27 13  aspects of the case, some documents to review, but

11:08:31 14  I'm sure it was related to something about the case.

11:08:33 15        Q.  Okay.  And then from then on, from

11:08:37 16  April 16 through July 31st, all of your entries say

11:08:44 17  Document Review; is that correct?

11:08:45 18        A.  Correct.

11:08:46 19        Q.  What documents did you review?

11:08:50 20        A.  Well, I was -- to be honest, I was

11:08:53 21  provided with many documents, as you can see from my

11:08:58 22  recent list here that I have in front of me, and I

11:09:07 23  understand I was provided with more testimony.

11:09:11 24            MR. TAYAB:  Let me mark Exhibit 6.

11:09:11 25  ///


                                                                 47










11:09:15  1            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 6 was

11:09:15  2            marked for identification by the

11:09:15  3            deposition reporter and is attached

11:09:16  4            hereto.)

11:09:16  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:09:16  6        Q.  Can you identify that document for the

11:09:18  7  record?

11:09:18  8        A.  Yes.  That is my Materials Reviewed

11:09:20  9  document that I put together and it's dated August

11:09:23 10  the 19th.

11:09:23 11        Q.  And is it fair to say that all of this

11:09:26 12  material was reviewed after you rendered your

11:09:29 13  declaration in November of 2016?

11:09:31 14        A.  Correct.

11:09:34 15        Q.  Okay.  And who sent you this material?

11:09:38 16        A.  Rob Jarchi's office.

11:09:40 17        Q.  Okay.  And did you review all of the

11:09:50 18  material that was sent to you?

11:09:52 19        A.  Yes.

11:09:52 20        Q.  So as far as I can tell, all of your

11:10:06 21  invoices through the present day, with the exception

11:10:12 22  of one invoice here that says Depositions, all of it

11:10:15 23  is document review.

11:10:16 24        A.  Yes.  There are many, many documents.

11:10:18 25        Q.  Okay.  Now, have you been asked to render


                                                                 48










11:10:21  1  any additional opinions in addition to the ones that

11:10:25  2  you've rendered in your declaration?

11:10:27  3        A.  No.

11:10:28  4        Q.  So all of the opinions that you've

11:10:30  5  rendered thus far in this case are contained in your

11:10:33  6  declaration --

11:10:33  7            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

11:10:34  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:10:34  9        Q.  -- is that correct?

11:10:35 10            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

11:10:42 11            THE WITNESS:  This declaration was

11:10:43 12  published or written in 2016.  Based on the recent

11:10:48 13  depositions that I've read recently, there may be a

11:10:55 14  situation where the current opinions that I've

11:10:56 15  provided in the declaration are actually further

11:10:59 16  enhanced or I could probably further elaborate upon.

11:11:02 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:11:03 18        Q.  Have you enhanced those opinions thus far?

11:11:07 19            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

11:11:10 20            THE WITNESS:  The data that I've seen and

11:11:12 21  the additional information that has been provided to

11:11:16 22  me further solidifies my opinions that was written

11:11:19 23  in this declaration.

11:11:20 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:11:21 25        Q.  Other than solidification of those


                                                                 49










11:11:24  1  opinions, are you planning to render any additional

11:11:28  2  opinions?

11:11:28  3        A.  At this point in time, no.

11:11:30  4        Q.  Okay.  Have you been asked to render any

11:11:33  5  other opinions in addition to those that are

11:11:35  6  rendered in your declaration?

11:11:37  7        A.  No.

11:11:37  8        Q.  Okay.  So is it fair to say that the

11:11:49  9  opinions that you render in your declaration are the

11:11:49 10  opinions that you intend to present to the jury in

11:11:54 11  this case at trial?

11:11:54 12        A.  Correct.

11:11:55 13        Q.  No additional opinions?

11:11:55 14            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates prior testimony.

11:11:57 15            THE WITNESS:  At this point in time as we

11:11:59 16  sit here today, that's correct.

11:12:01 17            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Let me give you what

11:12:54 18  has been marked as Exhibit 7.

11:12:56 19            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 7 was

11:12:56 20            marked for identification by the

11:12:56 21            deposition reporter and is attached

11:12:56 22            hereto.)

11:12:56 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:12:57 24        Q.  Can you identify that document for the

11:12:59 25  record, please.


                                                                 50










11:13:07  1        A.  It looks like it's a list of materials

11:13:09  2  provided to me.

11:13:17  3        Q.  Have you reviewed all of these materials?

11:13:21  4            MR. JARCHI:  Compound.

11:13:34  5            THE WITNESS:  I believe I have.

11:13:35  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:13:35  7        Q.  All of these materials?  You've reviewed

11:13:38  8  every one of these?

11:13:39  9        A.  At the minimum, I've skimmed these

11:13:42 10  materials.  There were some materials that were

11:13:48 11  more, let's say, interesting to me than others, but

11:14:00 12  most of the materials I do believe I have received.

11:14:04 13        Q.  You have received, but have you reviewed

11:14:06 14  them?

11:14:17 15        A.  The majority.

11:14:19 16        Q.  Did anyone tell you to review specific

11:14:22 17  items on this list?

11:14:30 18        A.  Can you repeat that question?

11:14:32 19        Q.  Did anyone select materials for you to

11:14:35 20  review from this list?

11:14:37 21        A.  Not that I believe.

11:14:39 22        Q.  Okay.  And are there any materials that

11:14:43 23  you requested that you haven't received?

11:14:48 24        A.  Can you repeat the question?

11:14:49 25        Q.  Have you requested any materials that were


                                                                 51










11:14:53  1  not provided to you?

11:14:55  2        A.  No.

11:14:55  3        Q.  So anything that you've requested has been

11:14:58  4  provided to you?

11:14:59  5        A.  I have not requested any materials.

11:15:01  6        Q.  Okay.  So whatever materials was provided

11:15:04  7  to you were the materials that you reviewed; you

11:15:07  8  have not undertaken an effort to ask for anything

11:15:10  9  extra?

11:15:11 10        A.  That's correct.

11:15:12 11        Q.  Okay.  Now, what fraction of time do you

11:15:21 12  spend in performing legal consulting work?

11:15:25 13        A.  From a time scale, it would be no more

11:15:32 14  than 10 percent.

11:15:33 15        Q.  Do you mainly work for plaintiffs or

11:15:37 16  defendants?

11:15:38 17        A.  Mainly, the majority of cases at the

11:15:41 18  moment are defendants, but I have been retained for

11:15:48 19  I believe a few plaintiff cases.

11:15:53 20        Q.  And how frequently do you work for

11:15:56 21  Mr. Jarchi's firm?

11:16:00 22        A.  Can you rephrase that in terms of defining

11:16:03 23  frequent?  Frequent in the terms of time or days of

11:16:05 24  the year?

11:16:05 25        Q.  Number.  How many cases have you worked on


                                                                 52










11:16:08  1  with Mr. Jarchi's firm?

11:16:13  2        A.  Just two.

11:16:13  3        Q.  This and the case that you previously

11:16:15  4  mentioned?

11:16:15  5        A.  Correct.

11:16:16  6        Q.  Okay.  And have you worked with any

11:16:18  7  experts on this case, any other experts in this

11:16:21  8  case?

11:16:21  9        A.  Yes.

11:16:22 10        Q.  Who?

11:16:25 11        A.  Dr. Lin Weaver and Dr. David Penney.

11:16:31 12        Q.  Okay.  And what case did you work on with

11:16:40 13  Dr. Weaver?

11:16:40 14        A.  With Dr. Weaver, I believe we worked on

11:16:43 15  the Saba case together and the Maciel case together.

11:16:57 16        Q.  Okay.  Just the two?

11:16:58 17        A.  And the Edwards case together.  And I

11:17:02 18  believe we are working on one more case together.

11:17:05 19        Q.  And that case, you have not been deposed

11:17:10 20  on that case or are offering any testimony on that

11:17:12 21  case?

11:17:13 22        A.  That is correct.

11:17:13 23        Q.  And where is that case pending?

11:17:18 24        A.  (Gestured.)

11:17:19 25        Q.  Where is that case pending?


                                                                 53










11:17:21  1        A.  Where?

11:17:21  2        Q.  Where.

11:17:21  3        A.  In Florida.

11:17:22  4        Q.  And what does that relate to?

11:17:24  5        A.  That relates to a boat having carbon

11:17:27  6  monoxide leaking in the boat cabin.

11:17:30  7        Q.  And how is it that you've come to work

11:17:33  8  with Dr. Weaver on these four occasions?

11:17:36  9            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation, lacks

11:17:40 10  foundation.

11:17:40 11            THE WITNESS:  Well, previously, I

11:17:42 12  mentioned my undergraduate work and that I was

11:17:46 13  funded by the Australian Medical Association.

11:17:49 14  Dr. David Penney was involved in that effort also.

11:17:52 15  I believe he was commissioned or contracted by the

11:17:57 16  Australian government.  And at that time, we had

11:17:59 17  some collaborations together across the Pacific

11:18:03 18  Ocean.

11:18:03 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:18:06 20        Q.  Oh, but my question was with regards to

11:18:09 21  Dr. Weaver.

11:18:10 22        A.  Dr. Weaver.  I believe --

11:18:13 23            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for -- sorry.  Calls

11:18:15 24  for speculation, lacks foundation.

11:18:17 25            THE WITNESS:  We worked on a case or


                                                                 54










11:18:20  1  several cases together.  Again, I believe the

11:18:26  2  current case and one more case I believe not listed

11:18:36  3  here.

11:18:36  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:18:36  5        Q.  Did Dr. Weaver recruit you for this case?

11:18:39  6            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,

11:18:41  7  assumes facts, calls for speculation.

11:18:42  8            THE WITNESS:  I do not know.

11:18:44  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:18:44 10        Q.  Did he recommend you to this case?

11:18:46 11            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

11:18:48 12            THE WITNESS:  Same answer.  I do not know.

11:18:50 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:18:52 14        Q.  Okay.  And are you working with any other

11:18:56 15  experts who are experts on this case?

11:18:59 16        A.  Not that I believe.

11:19:02 17        Q.  Dr. Hipskind; do you know who that is?

11:19:05 18        A.  No.

11:19:05 19        Q.  Dr. Helffenstein; do you know who that is?

11:19:09 20        A.  I believe I was on the Maciel case with

11:19:13 21  Dr. Helffenstein, but I never met him, I've never

11:19:18 22  spoken with him.

11:19:19 23        Q.  And you've never met him or spoken to him

11:19:20 24  on this case?

11:19:20 25        A.  That's correct.


                                                                 55










11:19:22  1        Q.  What about Mr. Hendrickson; do you know

11:19:24  2  who that is?

11:19:25  3        A.  I do know who that is.  I believe I met

11:19:28  4  him at the inspection of a heat exchanger in

11:19:33  5  Signal Hill.

11:19:33  6        Q.  That was in September of 2016?

11:19:36  7        A.  That's correct.

11:19:38  8        Q.  Okay.  What about Mr. Romig?

11:19:45  9        A.  I have never met him prior to this case.

11:19:47 10        Q.  Have you met him on this case?

11:19:50 11        A.  Face to face, no.

11:19:52 12        Q.  Have you spoken with him?

11:19:53 13        A.  Yes.

11:19:54 14        Q.  On the phone?

11:19:54 15        A.  Correct.

11:19:55 16        Q.  What about Dr. Hendrickson?

11:20:02 17        A.  I have never spoken with him over the

11:20:05 18  phone.

11:20:05 19        Q.  Okay.  So the one meeting you had at the

11:20:08 20  inspection was the only meeting you had with him?

11:20:10 21        A.  Correct.

11:20:10 22        Q.  And with Mr. Romig you have spoken with

11:20:16 23  him on the phone?

11:20:16 24        A.  Correct.

11:20:17 25        Q.  Approximately how many times?


                                                                 56










11:20:18  1        A.  I believe twice.

11:20:19  2        Q.  And when was this?

11:20:21  3        A.  At least within the prior three months.

11:20:24  4        Q.  Okay.  So it was relatively recently?

11:20:26  5        A.  Correct.

11:20:27  6        Q.  It was not prior to or at the time of your

11:20:31  7  declaration?

11:20:32  8        A.  No.

11:20:33  9        Q.  And what were the circumstances of you

11:20:35 10  speaking with Mr. Romig recently?

11:20:38 11        A.  Well, Mr. Romig was planning to undertake

11:20:42 12  some emission measurements from the burner, and I

11:20:44 13  wanted to make sure that -- to understand what he

11:20:48 14  was planning on doing and explore that with him.

11:20:52 15  And we also discussed the data that was provided for

11:21:00 16  the case.

11:21:00 17        Q.  You discussed the data provided for the

11:21:05 18  case prior to his doing the experiments?

11:21:09 19            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

11:21:10 20            THE WITNESS:  I don't recall.  I don't

11:21:13 21  recall.

11:21:13 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:21:14 23        Q.  Okay.  As far as I understand, as of

11:21:17 24  June 28th of 2019, Mr. Romig performed some

11:21:24 25  experiments on an oven and food makers, is my


                                                                 57










11:21:28  1  understanding; correct?

11:21:28  2        A.  I believe so.

11:21:29  3        Q.  Were you involved with that set of

11:21:32  4  experiments?

11:21:32  5        A.  No.

11:21:33  6        Q.  Any reason why you were not involved?

11:21:37  7        A.  Not that I'm aware of.  No reason.

11:21:40  8        Q.  Were you present in the country when the

11:21:42  9  experiments were going on?

11:21:43 10        A.  Actually, I believe I was in Europe at the

11:21:46 11  time.

11:21:46 12        Q.  So you were unavailable to do the

11:21:48 13  experiments?

11:21:48 14        A.  I wasn't asked to do the experiments.

11:21:50 15        Q.  Oh, you were not asked.  Okay.

11:21:53 16            Did you talk to any of the experts in this

11:21:55 17  case with respect to those experiments in June of

11:22:01 18  2019?

11:22:02 19        A.  No.

11:22:02 20        Q.  Did you have any input into the design of

11:22:04 21  the experimental protocols, for example?

11:22:07 22        A.  No.

11:22:07 23        Q.  Were you aware that the experiments were

11:22:09 24  going on?

11:22:10 25        A.  Yes.


                                                                 58










11:22:10  1        Q.  Prior to those experiments happening?

11:22:12  2        A.  I believe Dr. Romig mentioned they were

11:22:17  3  planning to do it, but -- and that's basically it.

11:22:21  4        Q.  Okay.  So you didn't have any involvement

11:22:23  5  in the -- in the design of the protocol or in

11:22:28  6  deciding how to conduct those experiments?

11:22:31  7        A.  No.  That's correct.

11:22:32  8        Q.  And did you come to find out what the

11:22:35  9  results of those experiments were at some point?

11:22:37 10        A.  Yes.

11:22:38 11        Q.  And when was that?

11:22:44 12        A.  I believe that was sometime after the

11:22:52 13  investigation.  Maybe -- again, I'm speculating --

11:22:57 14  sometime in July, I believe, late June or July.

11:23:01 15        Q.  What were you provided?

11:23:02 16        A.  I was provided with graphs plus.

11:23:11 17        Q.  Anything else?

11:23:12 18        A.  That's basically it.

11:23:14 19        Q.  Photographs of those experiments?

11:23:26 20        A.  No.

11:23:26 21        Q.  What about data plots?

11:23:28 22            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

11:23:29 23            THE WITNESS:  Data plots?

11:23:29 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:23:30 25        Q.  Let me rephrase:  What about the raw data,


                                                                 59










11:23:31  1  the raw underlying data in support of those charts?

11:23:34  2        A.  That may have been provided.  I'm not

11:23:36  3  sure.  It may have been provided.

11:23:37  4        Q.  Okay.  And did you have any discussions

11:23:39  5  with any of the experts on this case with respect to

11:23:42  6  the results of the experimentation?

11:23:44  7        A.  No.

11:23:44  8        Q.  So you were provided with these plots and

11:23:47  9  information, but you have not had any discussions

11:23:50 10  with any of the experts in this case with respect to

11:23:52 11  that data; is that what you're saying?

11:23:54 12        A.  That's correct.

11:23:55 13        Q.  Okay.  Do you know Dr. Jones?

11:23:59 14        A.  No.

11:23:59 15        Q.  What about Dr. Gill?

11:24:02 16        A.  No.

11:24:04 17        Q.  Have you ever worked with any of the

11:24:08 18  experts for defendants in this case?

11:24:10 19        A.  Can you repeat the question?

11:24:16 20        Q.  Not on this case, but on previous

11:24:17 21  occasions.  Say, for example, Dr. Freeman.

11:24:20 22            Do you know who Dr. Freeman is?

11:24:22 23        A.  No.

11:24:22 24            MR. JARCHI:  Just for the record, the

11:24:24 25  question is vague and ambiguous.  Did you say worked


                                                                 60










11:24:26  1  for or worked with?

11:24:27  2            MR. TAYAB:  Worked with.  I'm sorry.  Poor

11:24:30  3  grammar there.  Worked with.  Sorry about that.

11:24:33  4            THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase the

11:24:34  5  question?

11:24:34  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:24:35  7        Q.  Do you know who Dr. Freeman is?

11:24:37  8        A.  No.

11:24:37  9        Q.  Okay.  And what about Dr. Carnahan?

11:24:40 10        A.  No.

11:24:41 11            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Let me hand you what is

11:25:17 12  Exhibit 8.

11:25:18 13            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 8 was

11:25:18 14            marked for identification by the

11:25:18 15            deposition reporter and is attached

11:25:18 16            hereto.)

11:25:18 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:25:19 18        Q.  Do you know what that document is?

11:25:23 19        A.  So what's the question?

11:25:32 20        Q.  Have you ever seen that document before?

11:25:49 21        A.  Yes, I have.

11:25:50 22        Q.  And if you'll flip to the third page of

11:25:53 23  this document, or actually the second page of that

11:25:55 24  document, it lists a -- it -- on Page 2 it begins to

11:25:59 25  list a number of topics.


                                                                 61










11:26:02  1            Do you see that under numbered

11:26:05  2  Paragraphs 1, 2 and such?  Do you see that?

11:26:07  3        A.  Yes.

11:26:08  4        Q.  And those are requests for documents.

11:26:16  5            Have you complied with each one of these

11:26:20  6  requests?

11:26:20  7        A.  I believe I have.

11:26:21  8        Q.  For example, Number 4:

11:26:23  9       "Any correspondence,

11:26:25 10            including, but not limited to,

11:26:26 11            letters, faxes, E-mails to or

11:26:32 12            from deponent, or any agent

11:26:36 13            acting on behalf of the deponent,

11:26:37 14            in this case."

11:26:38 15            So you believe you've gathered all of the

11:26:40 16  correspondence related to this?

11:26:41 17        A.  Absolutely.

11:26:42 18        Q.  And provided that to your attorney?

11:26:44 19        A.  Absolutely.

11:26:44 20        Q.  All of your E-mails as well?

11:26:46 21        A.  Absolutely.

11:26:46 22        Q.  And then what about Number 5.  That is

11:26:50 23  communications with any other experts who are

11:26:52 24  designated to testify in this case.

11:26:54 25        A.  Absolutely.


                                                                 62










11:26:56  1        Q.  And Number 6.  All of your billing records

11:26:58  2  have been provided?

11:26:59  3        A.  Absolutely.

11:27:00  4        Q.  Number 7.  I do not see a retainer

11:27:04  5  agreement or a retention letter in this case.

11:27:06  6            Do you have one in this case?

11:27:07  7        A.  I don't believe I do.

11:27:09  8        Q.  So you're working without an engagement

11:27:13  9  agreement?

11:27:13 10        A.  Most of my cases are with an attorney

11:27:16 11  engagement letter, so it's not abnormal.  Once the

11:27:20 12  check is provided and taken to the bank, I consider

11:27:23 13  that as an acceptance.

11:27:24 14        Q.  Okay.  And then Number 8, any and all

11:27:27 15  articles or literature read, reviewed or relied upon

11:27:32 16  in forming your opinions in this case.

11:27:33 17            You have provided all of the articles that

11:27:35 18  you are relying upon?

11:27:35 19        A.  Absolutely.

11:27:36 20        Q.  Okay.  And then the list of cases we've

11:27:40 21  discussed already that you believe is complete.

11:27:43 22  That's Item Number 9, and Item Number 10 is your CV.

11:27:48 23            That's your most current CV that you

11:27:51 24  provided; is that correct?

11:27:53 25        A.  That's right.


                                                                 63










11:27:54  1        Q.  And then Item Number 11:

11:27:55  2       "All instruments, detectors,

11:27:56  3            sensors, and equipment for carbon

11:27:58  4            monoxide detection, testing,

11:27:59  5            and/or measurement, together with

11:28:00  6            their respective manuals,

11:28:02  7            operating instructions, used by or

11:28:04  8            provided to the deponent, or any

11:28:06  9            agent acting on behalf of the

11:28:09 10            deponent."

11:28:09 11  Have you -- are there any instruments that pertain

11:28:14 12  to that request?

11:28:15 13        A.  Not that I'm aware.

11:28:17 14        Q.  I recall in one of the documents that you

11:28:21 15  had inspected a CO sensor.

11:28:25 16            Am I correct in recalling that?

11:28:27 17        A.  I don't believe I did.  I'd love to see

11:28:35 18  the document.

11:28:36 19            MR. TAYAB:  Just give me one second.  Let

11:28:38 20  me try and find that, okay?  Why don't we take a

11:29:03 21  quick break while I look for this.

11:29:05 22            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.

11:29:07 23  The time is 11:29 a.m.

11:29:07 24            (Whereupon, a recess was held

11:37:30 25            from 11:29 a.m. to 11:37 a.m.)


                                                                 64










11:37:30  1            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the

11:37:32  2  record.  The time is 11:37 a.m.

11:37:34  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:37:35  4        Q.  Dr. Galatsis, before we went to break, I

11:37:39  5  was asking you about item I believe 11 in your

11:37:43  6  deposition notice, and one of the issues was, you

11:37:48  7  know, detectors and sensors that you may have

11:37:51  8  received.  If you'll take a look at Exhibit 2 and

11:37:55  9  the language that I've highlighted.

11:38:14 10            Now, that's Paragraph 13 of your

11:38:16 11  declaration, which refers to the materials which I

11:38:19 12  reviewed to assist in developing my opinion, and

11:38:22 13  that includes a carbon monoxide detector.

11:38:25 14            Can you tell me what detector that was

11:38:28 15  that you reviewed?

11:38:29 16            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony.

11:38:31 17  It's a partial reading of the entire sentence.  It's

11:38:34 18  misleading.

11:38:35 19            THE WITNESS:  So various photographs taken

11:38:37 20  of carbon monoxide detector.  So it was photographs

11:38:42 21  that I reviewed of the carbon monoxide detector that

11:38:46 22  was provided to me.

11:38:48 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:38:49 24        Q.  Okay.  So you never received a detector

11:38:53 25  or -- okay.


                                                                 65










11:38:54  1        A.  Correct.

11:38:55  2        Q.  Okay.  I get what you're saying.

11:39:02  3            And going back to your deposition notice,

11:39:04  4  Item Number 12, all photographs, audio recordings,

11:39:09  5  video recordings, and images, provided to or

11:39:10  6  generated by you.

11:39:11  7            Have you provided all of those?

11:39:12  8        A.  Absolutely.

11:39:13  9        Q.  Are there any audio recordings?

11:39:15 10        A.  No.

11:39:16 11        Q.  Any video recordings?

11:39:17 12        A.  No.

11:39:18 13        Q.  Okay.  But there are photographs that you

11:39:21 14  took and you produced in this case?

11:39:23 15        A.  Correct.

11:39:23 16        Q.  Okay.  And then Number 13:

11:39:25 17       "All records of any exemplar

11:39:28 18            testing or measurements."

11:39:29 19            Did you do any exemplar testing or

11:39:33 20  measurements in this case?

11:39:34 21        A.  No.

11:39:34 22        Q.  And have you provided all of the testing

11:39:38 23  that -- testing and data that was provided to you?

11:39:41 24        A.  Yes.

11:39:45 25        Q.  Okay.  And then Item Number 14.  All


                                                                 66










11:39:52  1  charts, graphs, models, simulations, blowups,

11:39:55  2  illustrations, or any visual aids prepared or

11:39:58  3  created by you in developing your opinions.

11:39:58  4        A.  Absolutely.

11:40:01  5        Q.  Have you provided all of those?

11:40:04  6        A.  Absolutely.

11:40:05  7        Q.  All right.  You can put aside the

11:40:10  8  deposition notice.

11:40:18  9            So what topics have you been designated to

11:40:21 10  opine upon in this case?

11:40:23 11            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

11:40:26 12  ambiguous.

11:40:26 13            THE WITNESS:  I've been -- similarly, as

11:40:30 14  my declaration shows, to opine on the situation of

11:40:36 15  carbon monoxide exposure as it relates to the DRO2G

11:40:43 16  oven.

11:40:43 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:40:43 18        Q.  In your declaration under Paragraph 12,

11:40:45 19  you say:

11:40:46 20       "The law firm of Greene,

11:40:48 21            Broillet & Weaver (sic) retained

11:40:49 22            me."

11:40:50 23            MR. JARCHI:  You said Weaver.  It's

11:40:53 24  Wheeler.

11:40:53 25            MR. TAYAB:  Wheeler.


                                                                 67










11:40:53  1            MR. JARCHI:  Dr. Weaver did not become a

11:40:56  2  member of this firm.

11:40:59  3            MR. TAYAB:  Still jet lagged, you know.

11:41:00  4            MR. JARCHI:  That's fine.  When did you

11:41:02  5  get back?

11:41:02  6            MR. TAYAB:  I got back midweek last week,

11:41:06  7  but it's been --

11:41:07  8            MR. JARCHI:  It takes a while.

11:41:08  9            MR. TAYAB:  It takes a while.

11:41:10 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:41:11 11        Q.  Paragraph 12; do you see that in your

11:41:13 12  declaration?

11:41:14 13        A.  Yes.

11:41:14 14        Q.    "I have performed an

11:41:17 15            analysis of the minimum levels

11:41:18 16            of exposure of the Plaintiffs in

11:41:20 17            this action to carbon monoxide

11:41:23 18            based upon my review of the

11:41:24 19            terms in this case."

11:41:25 20            Do you see that?

11:41:26 21        A.  Yes.

11:41:26 22        Q.  What do you mean by the term "analysis of

11:41:29 23  the minimal levels of exposure"?

11:41:32 24        A.  I would describe that by saying the

11:41:35 25  approach and the analysis that I've undertaken to


                                                                 68










11:41:38  1  come up with my opinions, specifically as it states

11:41:42  2  here to the exposure of carbon monoxide, is at a

11:41:46  3  conservative level.  It's making assumptions coming

11:41:53  4  from a conservative angle, and that is what the

11:41:58  5  minimum level refers to in Paragraph Number 12.

11:42:01  6        Q.  In other words, you're opining on at least

11:42:06  7  whatever levels you're opining on that they were

11:42:12  8  exposed to; is that right?

11:42:13  9        A.  Correct.

11:42:14 10        Q.  Okay.  And is that the extent of your

11:42:15 11  analysis?

11:42:17 12            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, asked

11:42:19 13  and answered.

11:42:19 14            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'll have to defer

11:42:22 15  to -- my declaration captures my analysis and its

11:42:30 16  conclusions.

11:42:30 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:42:31 18        Q.  Okay.  And does Paragraph 50 of your

11:42:33 19  declaration capture essentially all of your opinions

11:42:37 20  in this case?

11:42:37 21            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, asked and

11:42:40 22  answered.

11:42:40 23            THE WITNESS:  At this exact point in time,

11:42:45 24  yes, it does.

11:42:46 25  ///


                                                                 69










11:42:46  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:42:47  2        Q.  So in other words, this Paragraph 50,

11:42:51  3  you've got four opinions here; correct?

11:42:53  4        A.  That's correct.

11:42:53  5        Q.  And those are essentially the opinions you

11:42:56  6  plan to offer the jury in this case?

11:42:59  7        A.  At this point in time.

11:43:01  8            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the prior

11:43:02  9  testimony.

11:43:04 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:43:05 11        Q.  And you have not been asked to render any

11:43:10 12  additional opinions at this point in time?

11:43:13 13        A.  That's correct.

11:43:13 14        Q.  And you do not plan to render any

11:43:13 15  additional opinions at this point in time?

11:43:13 16            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

11:43:16 17            THE WITNESS:  At this point in time as I

11:43:16 18  sit here, I --

11:43:16 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:43:18 20        Q.  You have not been asked to?

11:43:20 21        A.  That's correct.

11:43:22 22        Q.  Okay.  Now, have you ever been disqualified

11:43:28 23  as an expert on any case?

11:43:29 24        A.  Never.

11:43:30 25        Q.  Has your -- have your opinions been


                                                                 70










11:43:34  1  challenged in any case that you're aware of?

11:43:38  2        A.  In my opinion, never.

11:43:41  3        Q.  And it's been about three years since

11:43:52  4  you've written this declaration; correct?

11:43:54  5        A.  (Nodded.)

11:43:55  6        Q.  Is there anything you want to change or

11:43:57  7  correct in this declaration?

11:43:58  8        A.  Yes, there is.

11:44:30  9        Q.  Okay.  Can you point that out to me?

11:44:32 10        A.  Yes.  On Page 9, Paragraph 30, last

11:44:37 11  sentence:

11:44:40 12       "The UL 2034 standard

11:44:46 13            requires alarming to take place

11:44:47 14            at 70 plus minus 5 parts per

11:44:50 15            million with a response time of

11:44:53 16            60-250."

11:44:55 17            That 250 should be 240 minutes.

11:44:58 18        Q.  Okay.  Any other changes?

11:45:06 19        A.  There is one more clarification.  Page 11,

11:45:20 20  Paragraph 38 is the OSHA standard.  They were

11:45:29 21  considering to change that at 35, as it states in my

11:45:33 22  declaration, but it did not get changed to 35, so it

11:45:37 23  stayed at 50 parts per million.

11:45:40 24        Q.  So you want to change 35 to 50?

11:45:43 25        A.  Correct.


                                                                 71










11:45:47  1        Q.  Okay.  Any other changes?

11:45:55  2        A.  That's all at this time.

11:45:57  3        Q.  So as you sit here today, other than those

11:46:01  4  changes, you believe your declaration to be accurate

11:46:05  5  in its entirety?

11:46:07  6        A.  Absolutely.

11:46:07  7        Q.  And you stand by all of your statements in

11:46:10  8  your declaration?

11:46:11  9        A.  100 percent.

11:46:13 10        Q.  Okay.  Now, are you planning on rendering

11:46:19 11  an expert report in this case?

11:46:21 12            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, calls

11:46:23 13  for speculation.

11:46:23 14            THE WITNESS:  I do not know.

11:46:25 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:46:26 16        Q.  Have you been asked to write an expert

11:46:30 17  report?

11:46:31 18        A.  At this point in time, no.

11:46:32 19        Q.  Now, how did you prepare for your

11:46:34 20  deposition today?

11:46:35 21        A.  I prepared for my deposition by reviewing

11:46:54 22  my declaration, of course, my invoices.  I prepared

11:47:02 23  for this deposition today by reviewing the raw data

11:47:07 24  coming from Mr. Bertoch's meter and also

11:47:17 25  Mr. Brignola's meter, reviewing handwritten notes of


                                                                 72










11:47:25  1  the inspection that occurred the 21st and 22nd of

11:47:32  2  September 2010, reviewing data from Dr. Romig

11:47:39  3  regarding his emission data sets he obtained in

11:47:46  4  June, reviewing my notes taken with TSI, which is

11:47:56  5  the manufacturer of Mr. Bertoch's detector used on

11:48:02  6  September the 22nd, reviewing technical service

11:48:10  7  bulletins.

11:48:10  8        Q.  Do you recall which ones?

11:48:13  9        A.  The rack oven heat exchange inspection

11:48:17 10  technical service bulletin specifically, which was

11:48:22 11  noted as Exhibit 16 of Gumbert.

11:48:28 12        Q.  Okay.  Why did you choose that particular

11:48:32 13  TSB to review?

11:48:35 14        A.  This is a particularly important TSB

11:48:39 15  because it highlights a method or a process where a

11:48:43 16  Hobart service personnel should proceed forward in

11:48:49 17  inspecting an oven, specifically a heat exchanger

11:48:53 18  inspection, and how one would determine that by

11:48:57 19  testing within the oven using a flue gas measurement

11:49:02 20  and employing COAF to determine that.

11:49:10 21        Q.  Okay.  We'll get back to that later.

11:49:13 22            Any other documents?

11:49:14 23        A.  Reviewing the materials I reviewed,

11:49:25 24  reviewing some literature regarding carbon monoxide

11:49:31 25  air-free measurements.


                                                                 73










11:49:35  1        Q.  Now, is that the Karg article?

11:49:39  2        A.  That includes the Karg article.  It

11:49:42  3  includes other references related to COAF and my

11:49:47  4  summary of that -- of those references.

11:49:51  5        Q.  And what are the other references related

11:49:59  6  to COAF that you mentioned?

11:50:01  7        A.  There are certain references I have used

11:50:05  8  that are highlighted in this document.

11:50:13  9        Q.  Which document are you referring to?

11:50:17 10            (Document handed to counsel.)

11:50:19 11            MR. TAYAB:  So let me go ahead, then, and

11:50:21 12  mark that.

11:50:28 13            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 9 was

11:50:28 14            marked for identification by the

11:50:28 15            deposition reporter and is attached

11:50:44 16            hereto.)

11:50:44 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:50:44 18        Q.  Show you what's marked as Exhibit 9.

11:50:47 19            Can you identify that document, please.

11:50:52 20        A.  This is a document that I published or I

11:50:54 21  put together on June the 6th, 2019 titled "Carbon

11:50:58 22  Monoxide COAF Measurements and Its Use as a 'Source

11:51:03 23  Concentration' to Estimate CO Ambient Levels & Air

11:51:07 24  Quality."

11:51:07 25        Q.  And why did you prepare this document?


                                                                 74










11:51:17  1        A.  I prepared this document to summarize the

11:51:25  2  key references that I believe were very important

11:51:28  3  and were frankly missed by the other experts that

11:51:36  4  were rebutting my expert opinion.

11:51:40  5        Q.  Which expert are you referring to?

11:51:45  6        A.  I believe it was Barrera, and the other

11:51:51  7  expert, unfortunately I do not recall.

11:51:53  8        Q.  Are you talking about Dr. Renee Kalmes?

11:51:57  9        A.  That's correct.

11:51:59 10        Q.  And what do you mean by missed by

11:52:02 11  rebutting experts?

11:52:03 12        A.  Well, they make some statements in that

11:52:09 13  document that I do not agree with.

11:52:12 14        Q.  Can you recall which statements you did

11:52:16 15  not agree with?

11:52:17 16        A.  The main --

11:52:17 17            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for a narrative.

11:52:18 18            THE WITNESS:  I'd prefer to actually read

11:52:22 19  the statements.

11:52:23 20            MR. TAYAB:  I'd be happy to.

11:52:28 21            Can we go off the record for a second?

11:52:31 22            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  The

11:52:33 23  time is 11:52 a.m.

11:52:33 24            (Whereupon, there was a brief

11:53:42 25            pause in the proceedings.)


                                                                 75










11:53:42  1            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the

11:53:44  2  record.  The time is 11:53 a.m.

11:53:44  3            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 10 was

11:53:44  4            marked for identification by the

11:53:44  5            deposition reporter and is attached

11:53:46  6            hereto.)

11:53:46  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:53:47  8        Q.  Dr. Galatsis, would you go ahead and

11:53:50  9  identify Exhibit 10 for the record, please.

11:53:52 10        A.  Sure.  This is titled "Declaration of

11:53:55 11  Renee Kalmes and Carlos Barrera," dated December 13,

11:54:03 12  2016.

11:54:03 13        Q.  And before the break, you mentioned that

11:54:05 14  there are certain statements in this declaration

11:54:08 15  that you disagree with.

11:54:09 16            Would you please point those out?

11:54:19 17            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; calls for a

11:54:20 18  narrative, overbroad, form.

11:54:24 19            THE WITNESS:  There is a statement here

11:54:29 20  saying:

11:54:30 21       "COAF is not a

11:54:33 22            toxicologically meaningful

11:54:34 23            measurement."

11:54:35 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:54:35 25        Q.  Is that Paragraph 8 on Page 2?


                                                                 76










11:54:37  1        A.  That is correct.

11:54:40  2       "It is not relevant to human

11:54:42  3            health but rather primarily used

11:54:44  4            to assess combustion equipment."

11:54:47  5        Q.  And you disagree with that statement?

11:54:50  6        A.  Correct.

11:54:50  7        Q.  Why do you disagree with that statement?

11:54:54  8        A.  Simply because the origins of the

11:54:58  9  definition and the use of COAF was developed early

11:55:04 10  in the 20th century for that exact purpose where the

11:55:10 11  impetus was on the human health aspects of occupants

11:55:16 12  of an enclosed space reaching and exposed to

11:55:22 13  100 parts per million within a one-hour period.

11:55:26 14            And what they did when they were

11:55:29 15  developing this methodology of COAF measurements was

11:55:33 16  to look at the human health aspects based on this

11:55:37 17  100 parts per million over a one-hour period that

11:55:41 18  they deemed to be inappropriate, and they backward

11:55:45 19  engineered the circumstances and the flu emissions

11:55:51 20  to come up with a COAF that would produce in a

11:55:54 21  certain volume of space, given certain assumptions,

11:55:57 22  an amount of flue gas, COAF, that would then occur

11:56:01 23  in the ambient up to 100 parts per million for one

11:56:07 24  hour.

11:56:07 25            So the point here is, the historic


                                                                 77










11:56:10  1  evolution of COAF or the origin of COAF has actual

11:56:17  2  roots and impetus and motivation from a human health

11:56:22  3  standpoint which, on Page 2, Paragraph 8, says the

11:56:27  4  total polar opposite.

11:56:34  5        Q.  And in preparing the document -- I forget

11:56:37  6  what the exhibit number is, the one that you

11:56:39  7  authored.  Exhibit 9.

11:56:44  8            So what is it that you prepared there in

11:56:48  9  response to the statements made in Paragraph 8?

11:56:51 10            MR. JARCHI:  Objection -- what's the right

11:56:56 11  word -- incomprehensible, violates the rules of time

11:57:01 12  and space as one was prepared after the other.

11:57:06 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:57:07 14        Q.  Do you understand what I said?

11:57:08 15        A.  Would you please rephrase?

11:57:09 16        Q.  You had indicated that you prepared this

11:57:12 17  document, which is dated June 6, 2019, Exhibit 9,

11:57:18 18  because in part, there were statements in

11:57:24 19  Dr. Kalmes and Barrera's declarations that you

11:57:28 20  disagreed with.

11:57:30 21            What I'm asking is:  What is it about this

11:57:33 22  document that responds to that disagreement that you

11:57:36 23  had?

11:57:36 24        A.  Sure, absolutely.  It provides key

11:57:41 25  references that gets to the heart of these disputed


                                                                 78










11:57:44  1  issues for the authors of this declaration to

11:57:51  2  review, and hopefully with those references, they

11:57:58  3  could review that and understand actually it isn't

11:58:01  4  quite what they believe it is to be.

11:58:09  5        Q.  And so was it for the exclusive purpose of

11:58:11  6  gathering these references to educate Mr. Barrera

11:58:17  7  and Dr. Kalmes that you prepared this document?

11:58:19  8            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

11:58:23  9            THE WITNESS:  No.  Actually, I was

11:58:25 10  inspired to put these together after reading this

11:58:29 11  because I see this actually occurring quite often in

11:58:33 12  various CO cases, and there is no one authority or

11:58:39 13  publication that one can go to to actually get a

11:58:42 14  historic perspective of the COAF measurement and

11:58:47 15  protocol that exists today.

11:58:49 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

11:58:50 17        Q.  Now, have you published this, or is it

11:58:52 18  something that you compiled for yourself?

11:58:54 19        A.  I'm considering publishing an extended

11:58:57 20  version of this, but for the time being, it's a

11:59:00 21  private document.

11:59:01 22        Q.  Have you shared it with anyone else?

11:59:03 23        A.  I have shared this with Dr. Romig.

11:59:09 24        Q.  And why did you share it with Dr. Romig?

11:59:14 25        A.  Actually, one of the main points was to


                                                                 79










11:59:17  1  get his feedback and his response to this, and I

11:59:22  2  actually also shared this with Dr. Karg.

11:59:27  3        Q.  And what was Dr. Romig's feedback?

11:59:33  4        A.  There wasn't any.

11:59:40  5        Q.  And did Dr. Karg respond to this?

11:59:45  6        A.  I believe he did.

11:59:58  7        Q.  Before we started discussing Exhibit 9,

12:00:06  8  you were talking about the various documents that

12:00:08  9  you've reviewed in preparation for your deposition.

12:00:10 10            Are there any other documents you reviewed

12:00:14 11  in preparation for your deposition?

12:00:17 12            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

12:00:18 13            THE WITNESS:  That was basically it.

12:00:23 14  There's also my deposition notes that, as I was

12:00:26 15  reviewing various documents, I would take some notes

12:00:30 16  and keep for my personal use.

12:00:32 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:00:32 18        Q.  Okay.  Any other documents?

12:00:35 19        A.  The various testimony, declarations,

12:00:41 20  depositions of definitely the plaintiffs, of

12:00:48 21  Mr. Gumbert from ITW, Mr. McGee, Mr. Vanwyk --

12:01:01 22        Q.  Okay.

12:01:02 23        A.  -- Mr. Mills, I believe, Dr. Mills,

12:01:18 24  Mr. Durazo.

12:01:19 25        Q.  Anyone else?


                                                                 80










12:01:21  1        A.  And various documents that was I believe

12:01:32  2  coming from ITW in terms of the evaluation

12:01:38  3  checklist, if I recall correctly.

12:01:42  4            MR. TAYAB:  Now, I did notice that there

12:01:43  5  was a particular evaluation checklist in your

12:01:48  6  records.  Let me go ahead and mark that.  Let me go

12:02:08  7  ahead and give you what's marked as Exhibit 11.

12:02:11  8            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 11 was

12:02:11  9            marked for identification by the

12:02:11 10            deposition reporter and is attached

12:02:11 11            hereto.)

12:02:11 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:02:12 13        Q.  Can you identify that document for the

12:02:14 14  record, please.

12:02:15 15        A.  Yes.  The title of the document, the DRO

12:02:21 16  Evaluation Inspection Checklist.  And there is a

12:02:23 17  date on the top left, 10-11-2002.

12:02:26 18        Q.  Okay.  And why did you look at this

12:02:29 19  particular DRO evaluation checklist?

12:02:32 20        A.  This is an interesting checklist for the

12:02:35 21  reasons that there is a checkmark on Item Number 13

12:02:43 22  that says heat exchanger inspection Per TSB-1169 has

12:02:50 23  failed, and along with it there is a letter from

12:03:02 24  Hobart to the Hobart customer mentioning that the

12:03:08 25  oven requires a new heat exchanger, the existing


                                                                 81










12:03:13  1  heat exchanger is cracked and can lead to further

12:03:17  2  damage to the oven.

12:03:22  3            And in addition to that, there is also

12:03:27  4  reference to how the situation allows exhaust gases,

12:03:33  5  such as deadly carbon monoxide, from the burner into

12:03:39  6  the oven cavity.

12:03:40  7        Q.  And where were you reading that part from?

12:03:45  8        A.  That is from the correspondence on the

12:03:47  9  last page of this Exhibit Number 11.

12:04:04 10        Q.  Why did you read this particular document

12:04:09 11  in preparation for your deposition?

12:04:10 12        A.  I read this because it was interesting, as

12:04:17 13  I didn't see a letter from Hobart sent to Albertsons

12:04:24 14  for this case.  So it was somewhat missing and it

12:04:33 15  was an interesting part of the material that was

12:04:36 16  provided to me.

12:04:37 17        Q.  And did you look at the DRO evaluation

12:04:41 18  checklist for the subject oven?

12:04:44 19        A.  I believe so.

12:04:45 20        Q.  And did you look at the quote that was

12:04:49 21  provided with that checklist for the replacement of

12:04:53 22  the heat exchanger?

12:04:54 23            MR. JARCHI:  Vague as to "provided" and

12:04:57 24  assumes facts.  It misstates the evidence.

12:05:03 25            THE WITNESS:  I believe you're


                                                                 82










12:05:03  1  referring -- do you have that?  Can I see that

12:05:06  2  document, please.

12:05:06  3            MR. TAYAB:  Sure.

12:05:06  4            (Document handed to witness.)

12:05:26  5            MR. TAYAB:  We can go ahead and mark this

12:05:27  6  as Exhibit 12.

12:05:29  7            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 12 was

12:05:29  8            marked for identification by the

12:05:29  9            deposition reporter and is attached

12:05:29 10            hereto.)

12:05:29 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:05:30 12        Q.  Would you identify that for the record,

12:05:31 13  please.

12:05:31 14        A.  So this is a document titled DRO

12:05:34 15  Evaluation Inspection Checklist.  On top there is a

12:05:37 16  date, 07-15-2002, Exhibit 12.

12:05:42 17        Q.  Have you seen this document before?

12:05:45 18        A.  Yes, I have.

12:05:46 19        Q.  And what is the condition of the heat

12:05:51 20  exchanger indicated on this document?

12:05:53 21            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.  It's a

12:05:55 22  multipage document, compound.

12:06:09 23            THE WITNESS:  The box is ticked as Failed

12:06:11 24  for Item Number 13 and it mentions Heat Exchanger

12:06:17 25  Inspection per TSB 1169.


                                                                 83










12:06:20  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:06:21  2        Q.  And this checklist refers to the subject

12:06:25  3  oven?

12:06:27  4        A.  I believe so.

12:06:29  5        Q.  And if you'll go to the next page, what do

12:06:37  6  you understand this service report to say?

12:06:45  7        A.  It says Repaired and Tested.

12:06:48  8        Q.  Where do you see that?

12:06:50  9        A.  At the bottom.

12:06:51 10        Q.  Can you show that to me?

12:07:01 11        A.  Sure.  Repaired and Tested.

12:07:02 12        Q.  Do you understand this to be a quote for a

12:07:12 13  heat exchanger given to the customer?

12:07:14 14            MR. JARCHI:  And for the record, Counsel,

12:07:16 15  are you referring to the next page now?

12:07:17 16            MR. TAYAB:  I'm referring to the next

12:07:19 17  page.

12:07:23 18            MR. JARCHI:  And what was the question?  I

12:07:24 19  apologize.  Can I have that read back?

12:07:24 20  (The record was read as follows:

12:07:24 21            Q.   Do you understand this to

12:07:24 22            be a quote for a heat exchanger

12:07:34 23            given to the customer?)

12:07:34 24            MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  That assumes

12:07:35 25  facts and misstates the evidence and misstates the


                                                                 84










12:07:39  1  testimony.

12:07:40  2            THE WITNESS:  I don't know if this was

12:07:42  3  given to the customer.

12:07:43  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:07:43  5        Q.  Would you go back to the previous page,

12:07:48  6  please, the second page.

12:07:50  7        A.  Okay.

12:07:51  8        Q.  And do you notice a signature at the

12:07:54  9  bottom left-hand side of this document?

12:07:58 10        A.  No.

12:07:59 11        Q.  It says Remarks Store Stamp, and there's a

12:08:03 12  signature there.

12:08:04 13            Do you know whose signature that is?

12:08:06 14        A.  No.

12:08:06 15        Q.  Did you attempt to find out?

12:08:18 16        A.  I see we have different signatures here.

12:08:21 17  That's what I see.

12:08:22 18        Q.  Different signatures to what?

12:08:24 19        A.  To the first page.

12:08:33 20        Q.  What signature do you see on the first

12:08:35 21  page?

12:08:36 22        A.  So you directed my attention to store

12:08:39 23  stamp signature; is that right, initially, or

12:08:42 24  customer signature.

12:08:43 25        Q.  Yes.


                                                                 85










12:08:44  1        A.  And I see it not being the same as

12:08:50  2  customer signature on the first page.

12:08:52  3        Q.  Whose signature is on the first page?

12:08:55  4        A.  I don't know.

12:09:01  5        Q.  Did you attempt to find out?

12:09:05  6        A.  No.

12:09:12  7        Q.  Could it be David Wilkes?

12:09:15  8        A.  Can you repeat the question?

12:09:17  9        Q.  Could it be David Wilkes?

12:09:19 10            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation, lacks

12:09:20 11  foundation.

12:09:20 12            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'm not sure.

12:09:22 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:09:22 14        Q.  Do you know who David Wilkes is?

12:09:25 15            MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.

12:09:27 16            THE WITNESS:  From the Albertsons store?

12:09:29 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:09:30 18        Q.  Do you know who David Wilkes is?

12:09:32 19        A.  I have seen the name.

12:09:34 20        Q.  Do you believe him to be an Albertsons

12:09:37 21  employee?

12:09:38 22            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation, lacks

12:09:39 23  foundation.

12:09:39 24            THE WITNESS:  Can you repeat the question?

12:09:45 25  I'm having trouble hearing.


                                                                 86










12:09:46  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:09:47  2        Q.  Do you believe him to be an employee of

12:09:49  3  Albertsons?

12:09:49  4            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation.

12:09:50  5            THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't know at this

12:09:52  6  point in time.

12:10:07  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:10:07  8        Q.  We'll come back to this.

12:10:07  9            Approximately how long did you spend

12:10:10 10  preparing for your deposition?

12:10:11 11        A.  Well, my deposition was scheduled for a

12:10:15 12  different day, so I spent probably a few hours

12:10:18 13  preparing for that initial time, and then the date

12:10:22 14  was changed.  In hours billed, I think in total it

12:10:29 15  is about at least 20 hours.

12:10:35 16        Q.  In those 20 hours, did you meet with

12:10:39 17  anybody to prepare for your deposition?

12:10:44 18        A.  Yes.

12:10:44 19        Q.  Who did you meet with?

12:10:45 20        A.  Well, yesterday I met with Mr. Jarchi.

12:10:49 21        Q.  For how long did you meet?

12:10:51 22        A.  We met starting at 10:00 until the

12:10:56 23  afternoon.

12:10:56 24        Q.  So about how many hours?

12:11:00 25        A.  I would say about seven.


                                                                 87










12:11:05  1        Q.  Did he give you any documents to review

12:11:07  2  when you met?

12:11:09  3        A.  No.

12:11:10  4        Q.  Well, what did you talk about?

12:11:13  5        A.  We talked about my deposition notes that I

12:11:16  6  summarized --

12:11:17  7        Q.  Okay.

12:11:18  8        A.  -- and the documents that I just verbally

12:11:22  9  mentioned to you prior.

12:11:23 10        Q.  Did he provide any documents to you?

12:11:28 11        A.  The most recent thing that was provided

12:11:31 12  was the data set obtained by Mr. Brignola, and I

12:11:43 13  believe that is it.

12:11:54 14        Q.  That's the only document he provided to

12:11:56 15  you yesterday?

12:11:57 16        A.  I think he provided this to me on Saturday

12:12:01 17  by E-mail.  Today is Monday, so, yes.  But this is

12:12:05 18  the most recent document that was provided to me.

12:12:09 19            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  So let me go ahead and

12:12:16 20  enter that document as an exhibit.  It's Exhibit

12:12:20 21  Number 13.

12:12:20 22            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 13 was

12:12:20 23            marked for identification by the

12:12:20 24            deposition reporter and is attached

12:12:20 25            hereto.)


                                                                 88










12:12:20  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:12:22  2        Q.  Can you identify this document for the

12:12:23  3  record, please, Exhibit 13.

12:12:26  4        A.  Exhibit 13 is the digital data obtained by

12:12:32  5  Mr. Brignola's equipment used during his

12:12:40  6  investigation, his visit onsite at Albertsons in

12:12:45  7  September 2010, and it shows various recorded data

12:12:51  8  points at various times, and the columns represent

12:12:58  9  various variables coming from the detector.

12:13:02 10        Q.  Okay.  And so this data suggests that it

12:13:04 11  was captured on September 22nd and September 23rd;

12:13:08 12  is that correct?

12:13:09 13        A.  That is what the time stamp represents,

12:13:12 14  yes.

12:13:13 15        Q.  And these are very early in the morning;

12:13:16 16  is that correct?

12:13:16 17        A.  Very early in the morning.  I see

12:13:19 18  10:33 p.m. and 1:19, but I do recall reading his

12:13:25 19  testimony that the time stamp was off, so I believe

12:13:29 20  there is definitely an offset here somewhere.

12:13:32 21        Q.  So this time is in error?

12:13:34 22        A.  That is what was mentioned in his

12:13:37 23  testimony.

12:13:37 24        Q.  So you've read Bertoch's -- no, this

12:13:42 25  is Brignola.


                                                                 89










12:13:45  1        A.  Correct.

12:13:46  2        Q.  So this is Brignola's data?

12:13:49  3        A.  Correct.

12:13:49  4        Q.  This is Brignola's data from his

12:13:52  5  inspection of the subject oven on the 22nd or the

12:13:57  6  21st.

12:13:58  7            Do you know what date?

12:13:59  8        A.  I believe this is the 22nd.  I believe he

12:14:03  9  clarified that in his testimony, if I recall

12:14:05 10  correctly.

12:14:06 11        Q.  Okay.  And what did you recall discussing

12:14:11 12  about this data?

12:14:12 13        A.  Well, first and foremost, this data is not

12:14:17 14  a -- it's not a sequence data set that gives us a

12:14:22 15  complete reading of the situation, so it seems to be

12:14:27 16  that he's capturing or recording data at ad hoc

12:14:31 17  periods of time, ad hoc periods of time, signifying

12:14:37 18  something.  I'm not sure what propelled him to press

12:14:41 19  the Record button.

12:14:44 20            The other feature here is that it further

12:14:49 21  aligns with the high numbers of COAF, the

12:14:54 22  measurements of the prior day also, and also falls

12:15:00 23  in sequence with the handwritten notes from both

12:15:05 24  Bertoch and Brignola.

12:15:11 25        Q.  And what are the COAF numbers here?  I'm


                                                                 90










12:15:15  1  having a hard time deciphering this.

12:15:18  2            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

12:15:21  3            THE WITNESS:  What --

12:15:21  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

12:15:22  5        Q.  Data point 54 for COAF?

12:15:25  6        A.  That's correct.

12:15:27  7        Q.  All right.  I've never seen this before,

12:15:33  8  so on a break I will take a more careful look and I

12:15:36  9  will ask you some more questions about that, okay?

12:15:43 10  So you can put that aside for now.

12:15:51 11            Now, in preparing for your deposition, did

12:15:53 12  you discuss any questions that would be expected of

12:15:57 13  you?

12:16:00 14        A.  No, not specifically.

12:16:02 15        Q.  Did you do a Q and A of any sort?

12:16:05 16        A.  Not specifically, no.

12:16:06 17        Q.  Okay.  Did you discuss your qualifications?

12:16:10 18        A.  No.

12:16:11 19        Q.  Your prior testimony?

12:16:13 20        A.  No.

12:16:14 21        Q.  Your methodologies?

12:16:18 22        A.  No.

12:16:18 23        Q.  Your conclusions?

12:16:21 24        A.  No.

12:16:22 25        Q.  So what essentially did you do for the


                                                                 91










12:16:25  1  seven hours that you were preparing for your

12:16:27  2  deposition?

12:16:27  3        A.  So we went through the documents, as I

12:16:29  4  mentioned.

12:16:30  5        Q.  Okay.

12:16:30  6        A.  We tried to actually look at the data set

12:16:33  7  and understand what's happening and try and map that

12:16:36  8  on to testimony provided the previous week from

12:16:42  9  Mr. Brignola, Mr. Bertoch and Dr. Romig.  So we had

12:16:47 10  the raw data, and it took some time for us to

12:16:51 11  understand the sequence of events.  So that took up

12:16:54 12  quite a bit of time.

12:16:55 13            And also, just making sure I have all the

12:16:59 14  documents that are important, as I've mentioned to

12:17:04 15  you, and that's basically it.

12:17:06 16        Q.  Now, did you draw any conclusions from the

12:17:08 17  review and analysis of the data set when you met for

12:17:14 18  seven hours?

12:17:14 19        A.  Oh, which data set specifically are you

12:17:16 20  mentioning?

12:17:18 21        Q.  You mentioned three data sets.  One is

12:17:22 22  Brignola's data set, Bertoch's data set and Romig's

12:17:28 23  data set.

12:17:30 24        A.  Further solidified my conclusions in my

12:17:34 25  declaration.  So nothing was new.  There was


                                                                 92










12:17:37  1  additional data points that further solidifies and

12:17:40  2  backs up my opinions --

12:17:42  3        Q.  Okay.

12:17:42  4        A.  -- that I have presented in my

12:17:44  5  declaration.

12:17:45  6            MR. TAYAB:  All right.  Let's go ahead and

12:18:18  7  take a break.

01:06:26  7  beginning of Media Number 2 in the videotaped

01:06:35 10

01:06:37 11                  EXAMINATION (Resumed)

01:06:37 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:06:38 13        Q.  Welcome back, Dr. Galatsis.  I am ready to

01:06:44 14  move on to a different topic.

01:06:46 15            So on 9-16-2016, did you have an

01:06:50 16  opportunity to inspect the subject oven?

01:07:03 17        A.  Yes, I believe I did.

01:07:06 18        Q.  And where was this inspection done?

01:07:14 19        A.  It was done in California, Signal Hill.

01:07:18 20        Q.  So was that at the Vollmer-Gray location?

01:07:21 21        A.  That's correct.

01:07:23 22        Q.  Who was present at this inspection?

01:07:27 23        A.  Numerous people were present.  The people

01:07:32 24  I recall was Mr. Jarchi and Dr. Hendrickson, and

01:07:46 25  that's as far as my memory goes.


                                                                 94










01:07:48  1        Q.  What about Dr. Jones?

01:07:49  2        A.  I do not recall.

01:07:51  3        Q.  Dr. Gill?

01:07:53  4        A.  I read her testimony and she was there,

01:07:57  5  but I don't -- again, I don't recall conversing with

01:08:00  6  her or meeting her.

01:08:02  7        Q.  Any other attorneys other than Mr. Jarchi?

01:08:05  8        A.  I'm sure there were, but again, my memory

01:08:08  9  fails me at this point in time.

01:08:10 10        Q.  And how long did this inspection last?

01:08:13 11        A.  I believe I was there for a few hours.  I

01:08:17 12  know that I was not there for the entirety of the

01:08:21 13  inspection, especially the destructive part of it.

01:08:26 14  I was there, I observed, I took some pictures and

01:08:31 15  saw the large gorges, the massive gorges, the

01:08:34 16  deterioration of the tubes in the heat exchanger.

01:08:39 17  And after that, the photos, the inspection, the

01:08:43 18  visual inspection, I believe I departed.

01:08:51 19            MR. TAYAB:  So I've handed you Exhibit 14.

01:08:53 20            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 14 was

01:08:53 21            marked for identification by the

01:08:53 22            deposition reporter and is attached

01:08:54 23            hereto.)

01:08:54 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:08:55 25        Q.  Can you identify that document for the


                                                                 95










01:08:58  1  record.

01:08:58  2        A.  Yes.  It seems like there are various

01:09:00  3  photographs taken of a heat exchanger with large

01:09:07  4  gorges.  I would describe it as of the heat

01:09:10  5  exchanger tubes, corrosion, cracks, et cetera, of --

01:09:17  6  I believe -- yes, I believe it's the subject oven.

01:09:20  7        Q.  Did you take these pictures?

01:09:27  8        A.  I've seen pictures similar to this and it

01:09:31  9  would not surprise me if these are indeed mine.

01:09:34 10        Q.  Okay.  And what was your role in this

01:09:39 11  inspection?

01:09:42 12        A.  Actually, I was quite passive in terms of

01:09:51 13  doing a traditional inspection.  It was more for my

01:09:56 14  understanding of visibly seeing the failure of the

01:10:02 15  exchanger, and I was actually shocked when I was

01:10:06 16  there.  I wasn't expecting to see what I saw.

01:10:09 17        Q.  In terms of the corrosion?

01:10:11 18        A.  In terms --

01:10:12 19            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

01:10:13 20  ambiguous, argumentative.

01:10:15 21            THE WITNESS:  In terms of the complete

01:10:20 22  disintegration of metal in the heat exchanger.  It

01:10:27 23  went beyond what I believe were cracks or some

01:10:30 24  failure at welds, but it was, again, what I can only

01:10:36 25  describe as a massive gorge and disintegration of


                                                                 96










01:10:44  1  metal.

01:10:44  2        Q.  And how old was this heat exchanger when

01:10:48  3  you saw it?

01:10:48  4        A.  Can you --

01:10:49  5        Q.  How old was this heat exchanger when you

01:10:52  6  saw it?

01:10:52  7        A.  I believe from all the data that I have

01:10:55  8  read it was put into place in 1997, so when I saw it

01:11:06  9  in 2016, that would make it just under 18, 19 years

01:11:18 10  old, I would presume.

01:11:18 11        Q.  And how long was it in operation?

01:11:21 12        A.  I believe it was taken out of operation in

01:11:26 13  the 2010 time frame.  So, yeah, that actually

01:11:35 14  changes the equation.  So it would have been

01:11:38 15  operating for about 13 or so years.  That's correct.

01:11:41 16        Q.  Is this first -- is this your first

01:11:44 17  inspection of a heat exchanger?

01:11:46 18        A.  No.  There was another situation -- I

01:11:50 19  wouldn't call it a case.  It was an inspection of a

01:11:54 20  furnace where the client thought -- actually, two

01:12:00 21  clients thought that they had cracked heat

01:12:02 22  exchangers, but that was not the case.  They were

01:12:08 23  wall-mounted furnaces.

01:12:09 24        Q.  And were these residential furnaces?

01:12:13 25        A.  Correct.


                                                                 97










01:12:17  1        Q.  Okay.  Did you get an opportunity -- oh,

01:12:20  2  have you done any other inspections of the subject

01:12:23  3  oven, or was this the only one?

01:12:25  4        A.  Of the subject oven, this is the only one.

01:12:28  5        Q.  Did you look at anything other than the

01:12:30  6  heat exchanger components when you did your

01:12:33  7  inspection?

01:12:33  8        A.  On this day?

01:12:34  9        Q.  On that day, yes.

01:12:35 10        A.  Not that I believe.

01:12:36 11        Q.  You did not look at the bake chamber or

01:12:40 12  any of the other components?

01:12:42 13        A.  I do not recall seeing that.

01:12:44 14        Q.  Okay.  So you looked -- as far as you can

01:12:47 15  recall, you looked only at the heat exchanger?

01:12:49 16        A.  I believe so.

01:12:50 17        Q.  Okay.  Now, did you get familiar with how

01:12:58 18  the DRO2G oven operates?

01:13:03 19        A.  At the abstract level, yes.

01:13:20 20        Q.  Sir, can you describe to me the basic

01:13:22 21  components of the DRO2G oven?

01:13:27 22        A.  It operates like pretty much most furnaces

01:13:31 23  operate where there is a burner, a blower, a heat

01:13:34 24  exchanger, a convection fan that blows air through

01:13:40 25  the heat exchanger to move and circulate and heat up


                                                                 98










01:13:44  1  the air.

01:13:45  2        Q.  You mean around the heat --

01:13:46  3        A.  Around the heat exchanger, that's correct.

01:13:49  4  So that function of combustion, fossil fuel

01:13:56  5  combustion to exchanging that energy or that heat to

01:14:00  6  an ambient environment or, in this case, an oven

01:14:09  7  environment, is fairly well understood by myself.

01:14:12  8        Q.  Okay.  And so this particular oven, it has

01:14:14  9  a bake chamber to the right-hand side; is that

01:14:17 10  right?

01:14:17 11        A.  That's what -- yes.

01:14:19 12        Q.  Do you know what the dimensions of the

01:14:22 13  bake chamber are?

01:14:23 14        A.  I believe the internal volume is about

01:14:26 15  90 cubic feet, if I'm not mistaken.

01:14:29 16        Q.  Okay.  Did you make those measurements?

01:14:31 17        A.  I believe I took that number from

01:14:34 18  Dr. Romig's testimony --

01:14:38 19        Q.  Okay.

01:14:38 20        A.  -- a few weeks back.

01:14:40 21        Q.  Okay.  And then to the left is a smaller

01:14:42 22  chamber where the burner sits?

01:14:44 23        A.  That's correct.

01:14:45 24        Q.  And the burner has a blow motor?

01:14:49 25        A.  Correct.


                                                                 99










01:14:50  1        Q.  And what's the function of the blow motor?

01:14:52  2        A.  To move air into the area of combustion.

01:14:54  3        Q.  So to provide combustion air?

01:14:59  4        A.  Correct.

01:14:59  5        Q.  Do you know what the rate of horsepower of

01:15:00  6  that combustion motor is?

01:15:00  7        A.  The rate of horsepower of the combustion

01:15:02  8  motor?

01:15:02  9        Q.  Actually, strike that.

01:15:03 10            Do you know what the rate of horsepower

01:15:06 11  the burner motor is?

01:15:08 12        A.  Of the burner itself?  I have seen various

01:15:13 13  numbers, but it is somewhere -- 300,000 BTUs, 318-,

01:15:23 14  320-.  I've seen various numbers, but it's in that

01:15:27 15  vicinity.

01:15:27 16        Q.  Oh, no, but I was asking about the

01:15:32 17  horsepower of the burner motor which is blowing air

01:15:35 18  through the burner.

01:15:36 19        A.  Understood.  No, I don't.

01:15:39 20        Q.  You don't.

01:15:40 21            Do you know what the air flow rate is past

01:15:43 22  the burner?

01:15:43 23        A.  No.

01:15:45 24        Q.  Okay.  And then from the burner, there is

01:15:49 25  a combustion chamber; is that correct?


                                                                100










01:15:52  1        A.  Correct.

01:15:52  2        Q.  That's where the flame comes out?

01:15:54  3        A.  Correct.

01:15:55  4        Q.  And what's past the combustion chamber?

01:15:58  5        A.  There is a combustion chamber.  Then I

01:16:00  6  believe there is a box, and then that goes into a

01:16:05  7  serpentine structure that I believe there are a

01:16:09  8  number of tubes that try and increase the surface

01:16:14  9  area, so when there is flow external to the heat

01:16:16 10  exchanger, it can heat up the environmental air

01:16:20 11  circulating.

01:16:21 12        Q.  Okay.  And the heat exchanger is connected

01:16:25 13  to a flue?

01:16:25 14        A.  That's correct.

01:16:26 15        Q.  Okay.  And what's the primary function of

01:16:28 16  the flue?

01:16:29 17        A.  The primary function of the flue is to

01:16:32 18  redirect toxic gas, combustion byproducts,

01:16:37 19  combustion of flue gas to an outdoor environment

01:16:41 20  where it is safe.

01:16:42 21        Q.  Okay.  And then you talked about air being

01:16:46 22  circulated around the heat exchanger.

01:16:48 23            How is that done?

01:16:49 24        A.  I believe that's done by a convection fan

01:16:55 25  or blower of some type so that the internal air of


                                                                101










01:16:59  1  the bake chamber can heat up.

01:17:01  2        Q.  And do you know the rate of capacity of

01:17:08  3  that convection fan?

01:17:08  4        A.  No, I do not.

01:17:09  5        Q.  Do you know what the mass flow rate of air

01:17:11  6  is over the heat exchanger?

01:17:12  7        A.  The mass flow rate over the heat exchange?

01:17:16  8  No, I do not.

01:17:16  9        Q.  Okay.  Did you attempt to find out?

01:17:20 10        A.  I had no reason to find out.

01:17:22 11        Q.  Do you have any reason to find out the

01:17:26 12  flow of air mass inside the oven?

01:17:31 13            MR. JARCHI:  Vague, form.

01:17:35 14            THE WITNESS:  I had no reason to find that

01:17:39 15  out either.

01:17:40 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:17:40 17        Q.  Is the flow of air not of relevance to

01:17:43 18  your opinions inside the bake chamber?

01:17:48 19        A.  The flow of air of an intact DRO2G

01:17:53 20  operating without a compromised heat exchanger is

01:17:59 21  not relevant to my opinions, no, it's not.

01:18:02 22        Q.  And what about the flow of air with the

01:18:05 23  heat exchanger with cracks in it?

01:18:08 24        A.  Can you rephrase that question?

01:18:12 25        Q.  Have you looked at the manner in which the


                                                                102










01:18:15  1  air flows inside the bake chamber with the

01:18:19  2  compromised heat exchanger?

01:18:21  3        A.  Other than looking at an animation that

01:18:24  4  I've seen provided to me and also looking at the

01:18:31  5  massive gorges of the heat exchange, I haven't

01:18:35  6  undertaken an analytical numerical analysis.  No, I

01:18:40  7  have not.

01:18:40  8        Q.  So you've done no calculations with

01:18:43  9  respect to how much air flows within the bake

01:18:46 10  chamber; is that right?

01:18:47 11        A.  That was not my tasked work.

01:18:50 12        Q.  Okay.  And you have not looked at the

01:18:53 13  quantity of air flowing out of the heat exchanger

01:18:56 14  through the cracks; correct?

01:18:58 15            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

01:18:59 16  ambiguous.

01:18:59 17            THE WITNESS:  Again, that was not part of

01:19:02 18  my tasked work.

01:19:03 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:19:03 20        Q.  But you have in your declaration spoken

01:19:06 21  extensively about the air flowing out of the heat

01:19:09 22  exchanger into the bake chamber?

01:19:12 23        A.  I don't understand what you mean,

01:19:15 24  "extensively."

01:19:16 25        Q.  Well, you've spoken about air from the


                                                                103










01:19:19  1  heat exchanger flowing through the cracks into the

01:19:24  2  bake chamber; correct?

01:19:25  3        A.  Actually, it's no different to how

01:19:28  4  Mr. Gumbert from ITW and Mr. McGee describes if

01:19:33  5  there is a compromised heat exchange how it would

01:19:36  6  enter into the bake oven chamber.

01:19:40  7        Q.  So it's just a factual statement.

01:19:40  8        A.  That's correct.

01:19:41  9        Q.  But you have not attempted to quantify it

01:19:44 10  in any way or attempted to determine how much or its

01:19:47 11  quantity or its nature; correct?

01:19:49 12            MR. JARCHI:  That's vague and ambiguous,

01:19:51 13  it's argumentative and it misstates the testimony,

01:19:52 14  asked and answered.

01:19:53 15            THE WITNESS:  Again, I have read

01:19:57 16  depositions from Mr. Gumbert and Mr. McGee and they

01:20:00 17  described themselves how toxic gas, flue gases would

01:20:06 18  enter into the bake chamber based on a compromised

01:20:11 19  heat exchange.

01:20:12 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:20:12 21        Q.  Correct.  That's obvious if there is a

01:20:14 22  crack and air can come out of the crack and get into

01:20:16 23  the bake chamber.

01:20:19 24            So it's just a factual statement; right?

01:20:19 25        A.  Correct.


                                                                104










01:20:19  1        Q.  You have not done anything to analyze the

01:20:22  2  nature of the air coming out, the quantity of the

01:20:24  3  air coming out; correct?

01:20:26  4            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:20:26  5            THE WITNESS:  Coming out of --

01:20:27  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:20:28  7        Q.  Coming out of the inside of the heat

01:20:29  8  exchanger into the bake chamber.

01:20:31  9            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:20:32 10            THE WITNESS:  Again, that was an analytical

01:20:36 11  calculation I did not attempt.

01:20:38 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:20:38 13        Q.  Okay.  Now, there is a hood above the

01:20:43 14  oven; correct?

01:20:44 15        A.  I believe so.

01:20:45 16        Q.  Okay.  What's the purpose of that hood?

01:20:51 17        A.  The hood above the door of the oven?

01:20:55 18        Q.  Correct.

01:20:57 19        A.  My understanding is that that hood is

01:21:01 20  meant to evacuate any smoke that may arise or smell

01:21:07 21  that may arise during a baking process to keep the

01:21:11 22  occupational space workable.

01:21:13 23        Q.  Okay.  And so when the oven door is

01:21:19 24  opened, does the hot air from the inside of the bake

01:21:23 25  chamber get into the hood?


                                                                105










01:21:24  1            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

01:21:26  2  incomplete hypothetical, object to form.

01:21:28  3            THE WITNESS:  Based on again, what I have

01:21:30  4  read, I have to defer to Mr. Gumbert.  As you

01:21:34  5  mentioned, as one opens the door, whatever is inside

01:21:38  6  the bake cavity of the oven will come at the person

01:21:42  7  that is opening the door.  They will be receiving a

01:21:45  8  blast of whatever is in the cavity.

01:21:48  9            Where that then goes on to, I do not know.

01:21:50 10  I haven't done the analysis.  I don't know the

01:21:53 11  operations of that dynamic situation.

01:21:56 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:21:57 13        Q.  Okay.  But would you agree that hot air

01:22:00 14  rises?

01:22:00 15        A.  Correct.

01:22:01 16        Q.  Okay.  So when the door is opened, does

01:22:03 17  the air rise up through the hood, or what happens to

01:22:07 18  the air when the door is opened?

01:22:09 19            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; incomplete

01:22:10 20  hypothetical, assumes facts.

01:22:17 21            THE WITNESS:  Again, with the situation

01:22:18 22  regarding the subject oven, I'll have to defer to

01:22:22 23  Mr. Gumbert that when one does open the oven, they

01:22:30 24  will be receiving a blast of whatever is inside the

01:22:33 25  cavity, the bake chamber.


                                                                106










01:22:35  1            Now, what proportion of that is going up,

01:22:38  2  across, down, sideways, left or right, I have not

01:22:42  3  analyzed.

01:22:42  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:22:42  5        Q.  And why is that?

01:22:48  6        A.  Because there was no need.  As far as I

01:22:51  7  was concerned, the dynamics before me in terms of

01:22:55  8  what an employee, a bakery employee is experiencing

01:23:00  9  opening the door, Mr. Gumbert definitively answered

01:23:04 10  in his testimony.

01:23:05 11        Q.  But you're the expert.  You're doing the

01:23:08 12  analysis, and you're opining that when the door is

01:23:11 13  opened, the person opening the door will be exposed

01:23:17 14  to the air from inside the oven; correct?

01:23:19 15            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

01:23:20 16            THE WITNESS:  I'm opining that based on

01:23:23 17  Mr. Gumbert's testimony.

01:23:24 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:23:25 19        Q.  No, but what's your view as an expert?

01:23:29 20  Are you an expert in thermodynamics?

01:23:32 21        A.  No.

01:23:32 22        Q.  Have you taken any courses in thermodynamics?

01:23:36 23        A.  Yes.

01:23:36 24        Q.  And are you rendering any opinion that

01:23:38 25  relate to the flow of air coming out of the oven


                                                                107










01:23:40  1  into the bakery area?

01:23:42  2            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:23:45  3            THE WITNESS:  Again, I haven't undertaken

01:23:48  4  any simulation modeling or analytical numeric

01:23:52  5  computation that would give me -- or give me an

01:23:56  6  opinion in that space.  That was not my task.

01:23:59  7            MR. JARCHI:  Just make sure you --

01:24:01  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:24:02  9        Q.  So, in other words, all you're saying is

01:24:03 10  when you open the oven door, hot air from inside the

01:24:07 11  oven comes out of the oven; that's all you're

01:24:10 12  saying?

01:24:10 13            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony.

01:24:11 14            THE WITNESS:  I'm not saying that; ITW is

01:24:14 15  saying that.

01:24:14 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:24:15 17        Q.  What are you saying?  When the employee

01:24:17 18  opens the oven door, what happens?  What are you

01:24:20 19  saying?

01:24:20 20        A.  I'm saying what the experts say in this

01:24:22 21  case and what the manufacturer is saying.  If the

01:24:25 22  manufacturer of this oven is testifying under oath

01:24:30 23  that when one opens the door, they will be receiving

01:24:33 24  a blast of what is in the oven cavity, then I have

01:24:37 25  no reason not to believe that person saying that


                                                                108










01:24:41  1  under oath.

01:24:43  2        Q.  So you're not rendering any sort of

01:24:46  3  opinion as to what happens to the air once it comes

01:24:50  4  out of the bake chamber when the door is opened --

01:24:53  5            MR. JARCHI:  It's argumentative.

01:24:53  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:24:55  7        Q.  -- is that correct?

01:24:55  8            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

01:24:56  9            THE WITNESS:  I have no reason not to

01:24:59 10  believe ITW.

01:25:00 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:25:00 12        Q.  You haven't done any analysis to figure

01:25:02 13  out what the flow path of the air is when the oven

01:25:06 14  door is opened and the air comes out of the oven?

01:25:09 15            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and form.

01:25:10 16            THE WITNESS:  I have no reason to believe

01:25:12 17  why the toxic gas from the oven when one opens the

01:25:17 18  door would not hit that person, that employee

01:25:21 19  opening that door, in line with the testimony given

01:25:24 20  by Mr. Gumbert and Mr. --

01:25:28 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:25:28 22        Q.  Right.  That's not what I asked.

01:25:30 23            MR. JARCHI:  You got cut off.

01:25:32 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:25:33 25        Q.  Were you done?


                                                                109










01:25:33  1        A.  Mr. Gumbert.

01:25:36  2            MR. JARCHI:  And you said somebody else

01:25:38  3  and you got cut off.

01:25:40  4            THE WITNESS:  Mr. McGee.

01:25:41  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:25:41  6        Q.  But you have not done any independent

01:25:43  7  analysis to figure out what the pathway of the air

01:25:46  8  is once the oven door is opened.

01:25:48  9            You're relying on somebody's else's

01:25:51 10  statement as to what happens?

01:25:52 11        A.  Again, I have not undertaken any modeling,

01:25:55 12  simulation, numeric calculation in the dynamics of

01:25:59 13  the air flowing out from the oven cavity up, down,

01:26:05 14  left, right.

01:26:05 15        Q.  Okay.

01:26:06 16        A.  I depend on the testimony from ITW.

01:26:11 17        Q.  Okay.  Now, continuing with your

01:26:12 18  understanding as to how the oven works, the flue

01:26:20 19  stack, is that connected to something called a draft

01:26:25 20  inducer?

01:26:26 21        A.  I believe that's correct.

01:26:27 22        Q.  Do you know what a draft inducer is?

01:26:30 23        A.  It is a -- it is a motor that moves air,

01:26:39 24  and it is inducing, since it is in effect sucking

01:26:42 25  air from a certain location.  In this case, it is


                                                                110










01:26:45  1  the heat exchanger, or the flue connected to the

01:26:50  2  heat exchanger.

01:26:50  3        Q.  Do you have any idea as to what the rate

01:26:54  4  of capacity of that motor is?

01:26:54  5            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:26:55  6            THE WITNESS:  The capacity of the motor,

01:26:57  7  no.

01:26:57  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:26:58  9        Q.  Do you have any idea what amount of mass

01:27:00 10  of air is drawn through the draft inducer when it's

01:27:03 11  operating?

01:27:04 12            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:27:09 13            THE WITNESS:  No, I do not.

01:27:10 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:27:10 15        Q.  And is the draft inducer coupled to

01:27:14 16  something called a barometer damper?

01:27:18 17        A.  I'm not sure.

01:27:20 18        Q.  Now, have you -- do you generally

01:27:29 19  understand how the air flows through the combustion

01:27:35 20  chamber into the heat exchanger into the flue pipe,

01:27:39 21  the draft inducer, the barometer damper and then

01:27:41 22  out?  Do you generally understand the flow of air to

01:27:44 23  that part of the oven?

01:27:48 24        A.  Again, in abstract form, yes, I do believe

01:27:50 25  I understand that.


                                                                111










01:27:51  1        Q.  Okay.  You have not quantified that flow

01:27:54  2  of air in any way?

01:27:55  3        A.  I have not quantified it in terms again of

01:27:58  4  a simulation or a model or a numeric calculation of

01:28:03  5  some variable with respect to that operation.

01:28:07  6        Q.  And do you understand the flow of air

01:28:11  7  inside the oven from the blower motor to over the

01:28:20  8  heat exchanger into the bake chamber; there's a

01:28:24  9  recycling of air; isn't that correct?

01:28:26 10        A.  The general concept and the mechanism of

01:28:29 11  that is to heat up the air in a homogenous fashion

01:28:34 12  so, ultimately, the bake product can be cooked as

01:28:38 13  even as possible.

01:28:39 14        Q.  And -- but have you quantified the motion

01:28:43 15  of air within the mass flow rates or things like

01:28:48 16  that?

01:28:48 17        A.  The motion of air or the mass flow rates,

01:28:51 18  I didn't undertake any modeling or simulation.

01:28:54 19        Q.  And your understanding is that as long as

01:28:54 20  the air is circulating, the composition of the air

01:28:58 21  is homogenous within the bake chamber and the

01:28:59 22  temperature is constant; is that correct?

01:29:01 23        A.  No, it's not.  That is an objective the

01:29:06 24  oven has to achieve.  In a situation where it's

01:29:11 25  starting or there's a compromised heat exchange, a


                                                                112










01:29:16  1  lot of the variables are changing.  That is my

01:29:18  2  understanding.

01:29:19  3        Q.  Okay.  And do you have an understanding as

01:29:35  4  to how the burner in this oven works?

01:29:45  5        A.  A general understanding, an abstract, yes.

01:29:48  6        Q.  And what's your understanding as to how

01:29:50  7  the burner works?

01:29:51  8        A.  My understanding is that the burner is

01:29:53  9  achieving combustion to translate a fossil fuel,

01:29:59 10  which in this case is natural gas, coming in at a

01:30:03 11  certain pressure and flow, and it is mixing that

01:30:08 12  natural gas as efficiently as possible in some

01:30:13 13  fashion with air coming into the same combustion

01:30:21 14  space and it is being ignited to produce a thermal

01:30:26 15  energy by combustion.

01:30:27 16        Q.  Now, have you looked at the manual for the

01:30:32 17  burner?

01:30:33 18        A.  I have looked at it.

01:30:35 19        Q.  And do you understand the sequence of

01:30:38 20  operations of how the burner works when there's a

01:30:42 21  call for heat?

01:30:43 22        A.  It's fairly detailed.  Do I understand it?

01:30:46 23  No, I don't.  If you're going to ask me to repeat

01:30:52 24  it, I don't know how that sequence of commands

01:30:56 25  operates because it gets somewhat complicated.


                                                                113










01:31:00  1        Q.  So do you understand that once there's a

01:31:03  2  call for heat, the burner has what's called a

01:31:07  3  pre-purge timer that runs for 30 seconds after

01:31:11  4  there's a command for heat?  Do you understand that?

01:31:15  5        A.  I believe I may.

01:31:16  6            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; form.

01:31:18  7            THE WITNESS:  I believe I may have read

01:31:20  8  that.

01:31:20  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:31:20 10        Q.  Okay.  Do you understand what a 30-second

01:31:24 11  pre-purge cycle could be for?

01:31:26 12        A.  No.

01:31:27 13        Q.  Do you have an understanding that the

01:31:30 14  burner motor comes on for 30 seconds before the

01:31:33 15  burner fires?

01:31:40 16            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:31:41 17            THE WITNESS:  Can you repeat that

01:31:42 18  question?

01:31:43 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:31:43 20        Q.  So the burner has a pre-purge relay that

01:31:47 21  delays the ignition by 30 seconds.

01:31:51 22            Do you understand that?

01:31:52 23            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

01:31:53 24  ambiguous, form.

01:31:54 25            THE WITNESS:  I do understand it, but I


                                                                114










01:31:57  1  don't -- I have many questions regarding that, but

01:32:01  2  if that's what is written in the instruction manual,

01:32:05  3  okay.

01:32:05  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:32:06  5        Q.  And do you know what the purpose of that

01:32:08  6  is?

01:32:08  7        A.  No.

01:32:08  8        Q.  Do you understand that -- do you not

01:32:11  9  understand that to be a mechanism to purge the air

01:32:19 10  past the burner for 30 seconds before the burner

01:32:21 11  comes on?

01:32:22 12            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous and

01:32:24 13  incomplete hypothetical.

01:32:25 14            THE WITNESS:  I have not had that

01:32:27 15  understanding.  I don't know what else to say

01:32:32 16  regarding that question.

01:32:33 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:32:33 18        Q.  And the manner in which the burner

01:32:35 19  operates, is that relevant to your opinions?

01:32:39 20            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:32:41 21            THE WITNESS:  It's a bit of a difficult

01:32:43 22  question to answer, the manner in which it operates.

01:32:49 23  What do you mean by operate?  In terms of physically

01:32:53 24  combusting fossil fuels or receiving commands from a

01:32:56 25  control or receiving commands from a system?


                                                                115










01:32:58  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:32:59  2        Q.  I'm specifically talking about the

01:33:02  3  sequence at which it operates.

01:33:05  4        A.  I have not studied that.

01:33:06  5        Q.  Okay.  And you did not consider it

01:33:09  6  necessary for your opinions; is that correct?

01:33:13  7        A.  For my opinions I did not study that;

01:33:16  8  hence, I believe it did not have a bearing on my

01:33:19  9  opinions.

01:33:20 10        Q.  Okay.  Now, do you understand what a duty

01:33:23 11  cycle is for a burner?

01:33:24 12        A.  Yes, I do.

01:33:25 13        Q.  What is -- what's your understanding of a

01:33:29 14  duty cycle?

01:33:29 15        A.  A duty cycle is a common metric used in

01:33:36 16  engineering, to start with.  It's usually quoted in

01:33:42 17  percentage.

01:33:43 18            For example, if something is on for one

01:33:49 19  minute and it is off for three minutes, one then has

01:33:55 20  a duty cycle of on for 25 percent, so the duty cycle

01:34:01 21  equals 25 percent.

01:34:03 22            Now, I've seen duty cycle used in other

01:34:06 23  formats in other domains differently, but typically

01:34:10 24  speaking, when one speaks of a duty cycle, it means

01:34:14 25  something is on for a certain period of time and


                                                                116










01:34:17  1  something is off for a certain period of time.

01:34:19  2        Q.  And do you understand what the duty cycle

01:34:23  3  for the burner in the subject oven is -- or strike

01:34:27  4  that.

01:34:27  5            Do you understand what -- in general

01:34:30  6  terms, what the duty cycle of the burner in a DRO2G

01:34:37  7  oven is?

01:34:39  8            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:34:39  9            THE WITNESS:  Do I understand what it is?

01:34:41 10  I believe I do understand what it is, yes.

01:34:45 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:34:46 12        Q.  Now, is the burner on constantly while the

01:34:49 13  bake cycle is going on?

01:34:51 14            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

01:34:52 15  incomplete hypothetical.

01:34:54 16            THE WITNESS:  It depends on the various

01:34:56 17  items, parameters, variables.

01:34:58 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:34:59 19        Q.  So if you set the oven for 400 degrees

01:35:03 20  Fahrenheit and the bake cycle for a particular

01:35:06 21  product is, say, 20 minutes, does the burner come

01:35:10 22  off and on during that process, or does it stay on

01:35:14 23  all the time?

01:35:15 24            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

01:35:15 25  incomplete hypothetical.


                                                                117










01:35:17  1            THE WITNESS:  Again, for that specific

01:35:20  2  condition you gave me, it's hard for me to give you

01:35:23  3  a definitive answer.

01:35:26  4            But in general, just like our home

01:35:29  5  furnace, our home heater, no different.  It's --

01:35:34  6  it's not uncommon to have a burner turn on and turn

01:35:38  7  off as controlled by the thermostat to achieve a

01:35:42  8  certain steady temperature.

01:35:44  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:35:45 10        Q.  And so when the burner is on, combustion

01:35:51 11  gases are formed; correct?

01:35:52 12        A.  That's correct.

01:35:55 13        Q.  Are combustion gases formed when the

01:35:58 14  burner is off?

01:36:02 15        A.  What do you mean "formed," new combustion

01:36:04 16  products generated when the burner is off?

01:36:06 17        Q.  Correct.

01:36:06 18        A.  No, they are not.  Existing combustion

01:36:09 19  gases remain.  In this case, they remain within the

01:36:13 20  oven cavity.

01:36:14 21        Q.  And what's your basis for saying that?

01:36:17 22        A.  My basis for saying that the flue gases

01:36:20 23  remain in the oven cavity is in line with, again,

01:36:24 24  Mr. Gumbert referring to flue gases coming into the

01:36:30 25  oven cavity if there is a compromised heat exchange,


                                                                118










01:36:35  1  and we know for a fact that is the case for this

01:36:38  2  oven.

01:36:38  3        Q.  There is a draft inducer, is there not,

01:36:39  4  which is sucking out air from within the heat

01:36:42  5  exchanger?

01:36:44  6        A.  That's correct.

01:36:45  7            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

01:36:47  8  incomplete hypothetical.

01:36:47  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:36:48 10        Q.  And by extension, sucking out air from

01:36:52 11  through the cracks; isn't that correct?

01:36:54 12            MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, misstates the

01:36:59 13  evidence.

01:36:59 14            THE WITNESS:  It would be sucking --

01:37:02 15  again, it's hard for me to answer the question not

01:37:05 16  understanding how the oven operates with respect to

01:37:08 17  when the burner is off.  I do not know if the

01:37:15 18  inducer continues to operate once the burner is off.

01:37:20 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:37:20 20        Q.  So you don't know one way or the other

01:37:23 21  whether the draft inducer operates when the burner

01:37:26 22  is off?

01:37:26 23        A.  I haven't seen testimony if it is off or

01:37:29 24  on.

01:37:29 25        Q.  You have not read anything in the


                                                                119










01:37:31  1  instruction manual that says the draft inducer is on

01:37:35  2  for at least 20 minutes after the burner goes off?

01:37:37  3        A.  I'd love to see it.

01:37:39  4            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Let me show it to you.

01:39:12  5            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 16 was

01:39:12  6            marked for identification by the

01:39:12  7            deposition reporter and is attached

01:39:12  8            hereto.)

01:39:13  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:39:13 10        Q.  Take a look at Exhibit 16, if you will.

01:39:15 11            MR. JARCHI:  What page?

01:39:16 12            MS. GARRISON:  Exhibit 16.

01:39:25 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:39:26 14        Q.  Have you seen this document before?

01:39:32 15        A.  (No audible response.)

01:42:03 16        Q.  Dr. Galatsis, have you seen this document

01:42:05 17  before?

01:42:05 18        A.  I may have, but I do not recall it.

01:42:08 19        Q.  Okay.  So if you'll go to Page 4, I just

01:42:12 20  want to see if you can help me with something.

01:42:19 21            Page 4 describes the sequence of operation

01:42:22 22  of the DRO2G oven as it's being loaded and unloaded.

01:42:29 23        A.  Okay.

01:42:29 24        Q.  And before I handed you the document, I

01:42:32 25  asked you the question as to whether you understand


                                                                120










01:42:35  1  that the stack fan, which is the draft inducer fan,

01:42:42  2  remains on for 20 minutes after the burner is off.

01:42:46  3            Do you remember that?

01:42:47  4        A.  Yes.

01:42:47  5        Q.  Now, I've highlighted two sections there.

01:42:50  6  One is during the loading and unloading section that

01:42:50  7  says:

01:42:54  8       "Note, stack fan operates on

01:42:56  9            a 20-minute delay before 4TR 25/26

01:43:05 10            is open."

01:43:06 11            Do you see that?

01:43:07 12        A.  I do.  Just give me one minute, please.

01:43:10 13        Q.  Sure.  Take your time.

01:43:10 14            (Document reviewed by witness.)

01:44:28 15            THE WITNESS:  Okay.

01:44:28 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:44:28 17        Q.  Okay.  Do you see the highlighted language

01:44:31 18  I've got there?

01:44:32 19        A.  Yes.

01:44:32 20        Q.  Okay.  So do you understand that under the

01:44:38 21  sequence of operations for the DRO2G oven, the stack

01:44:44 22  fan remains on for 20 minutes after the burner goes

01:44:48 23  off?

01:44:49 24            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

01:44:51 25  ambiguous as to do you understand versus what it


                                                                121










01:44:54  1  says in the document.  Incomplete hypothetical.

01:44:59  2            THE WITNESS:  I see that there is text

01:45:02  3  here saying:

01:45:04  4       "Stack fan operates on a

01:45:07  5            20-minute delay before 4TR 25/26

01:45:16  6            is open. 4TR 25/26 is in series

01:45:22  7            with a switch, an M3 switch."

01:45:26  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:45:26  9        Q.  Okay.

01:45:28 10        A.  And to answer your question, which was

01:45:31 11  specifically -- can you rephrase that again?

01:45:35 12        Q.  So the stack fan continues to operate for

01:45:39 13  20 minutes after the burner turns off?

01:45:43 14            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

01:45:46 15  incomplete hypothetical.

01:45:47 16            THE WITNESS:  It's hard for me to answer

01:45:49 17  that question, not understanding what M3 is.

01:45:52 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:45:53 19        Q.  Okay.  Now, assume that M3 is the burner,

01:45:57 20  okay?  Can you do that for me?

01:45:59 21            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

01:46:01 22  incomplete hypothetical.

01:46:15 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:46:15 24        Q.  I'm just trying to understand a very

01:46:19 25  simple thing here.


                                                                122










01:46:20  1        A.  Sure.  So am I.  I'm not trying to

01:46:21  2  understand a simple series circuit, but it's hard

01:46:21  3  for me to have these definitions.

01:46:24  4        Q.  Okay.  So assume that the stack fan

01:46:29  5  operates -- continues to operate after the burner

01:46:32  6  goes off.

01:46:34  7            Would that evacuate the combustion

01:46:37  8  products from the oven --

01:46:38  9            MR. JARCHI:  Objection --

01:46:38 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:46:39 11        Q.  -- or from the heat exchanger?

01:46:41 12            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; incomplete

01:46:42 13  hypothetical, assumes facts not in evidence.

01:46:46 14            THE WITNESS:  Again, the way I'm reading

01:46:48 15  this circuit diagram coming -- being an electronic

01:46:52 16  engineer and putting schematics like this together,

01:46:56 17  I see M3 being a switch open that has to be closed

01:47:01 18  for the stack fan to continue operating, irrelevant

01:47:04 19  of what 4TA is doing, as referenced in this bullet

01:47:11 20  point that you highlighted.

01:47:12 21            So it's hard for me to engage with this

01:47:16 22  assumption and hypothetical that if M3 is open,

01:47:19 23  because you mentioned it would be off, which is in

01:47:22 24  the open state.  So I don't see how the stack fan is

01:47:26 25  operating when there is no closed circuit.


                                                                123










01:47:30  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:47:30  2        Q.  So is it your understanding that the stack

01:47:33  3  fan does not operate when the burner is off?

01:47:35  4        A.  Based on what you're providing me today

01:47:38  5  and this immediate understanding, I don't see how

01:47:41  6  it's operating when M3 is off.

01:47:43  7        Q.  Okay.  So have you attempted to understand

01:47:46  8  the sequence of operations with this oven?

01:47:49  9            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

01:47:51 10            THE WITNESS:  In the past few minutes I

01:47:53 11  have tried.

01:47:54 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:47:54 13        Q.  Okay.  And other than the past few

01:47:57 14  minutes, have you ever attempted to understand the

01:48:00 15  sequence of operations of a 2G oven, DRO2G oven?

01:48:06 16        A.  In this granularity, I have not, but in

01:48:09 17  the abstract form, yes.

01:48:11 18        Q.  Isn't that relevant to the opinions that

01:48:15 19  you're rendering that you understand precisely how

01:48:19 20  this oven works?

01:48:20 21            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

01:48:21 22  ambiguous, argumentative, assumes facts, incomplete

01:48:24 23  hypothetical, form.

01:48:25 24            THE WITNESS:  The use of fan, as its

01:48:29 25  called here, fan, is drawing a pressure of .04 to


                                                                124










01:48:36  1  .08 water column.  That is very small.  That is very

01:48:36  2  small.

01:48:44  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:48:44  4        Q.  But you don't know what amount of air it's

01:48:47  5  drawing?

01:48:47  6        A.  Now, the amount of air, the volume of air

01:48:50  7  it is moving across its orifice, I have not seen it.

01:48:55  8  I do not know.

01:48:56  9        Q.  You haven't attempted to study it or

01:48:58 10  quantify it; is that correct?

01:49:00 11            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

01:49:01 12  incomplete hypothetical, misstates prior testimony.

01:49:07 13            THE WITNESS:  I know that the pressure,

01:49:11 14  the negative pressure created by the inducer fan

01:49:14 15  does not change my opinions whatsoever.

01:49:17 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:49:18 17        Q.  Okay.  So regardless of the fact that

01:49:19 18  there's a negative pressure operating from the draft

01:49:22 19  inducer, it would not impact your opinions one way

01:49:25 20  or the other is what you're saying?

01:49:27 21        A.  What I'm saying is I haven't seen that

01:49:29 22  that is the case, and from the data that I have

01:49:36 23  seen, my opinions stand.

01:49:38 24        Q.  Okay.  And if air is being evacuated from

01:49:45 25  the oven when the burner is off through the bake


                                                                125










01:49:49  1  cycle, that doesn't impact your opinion one way or

01:49:54  2  the other?

01:49:54  3            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

01:49:55  4  assumes facts not in evidence, misstates the prior

01:49:58  5  testimony.

01:49:58  6            THE WITNESS:  I would have to analyze the

01:49:59  7  data with some granularity and key variables, such

01:50:05  8  as mass flow, when that's occurring, et cetera,

01:50:08  9  et cetera.

01:50:09 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:50:10 11        Q.  And you have not attempted to do so yet?

01:50:13 12        A.  I haven't seen any data, given the vast

01:50:16 13  amounts of information that I have seen there.

01:50:19 14        Q.  But this is not data; this is basic

01:50:22 15  sequence of operations of an oven --

01:50:22 16            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

01:50:22 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:50:25 18        Q.  -- of this particular oven, and you

01:50:26 19  haven't attempted to figure out the basic ways in

01:50:29 20  which this oven works; is that correct?

01:50:31 21            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, assumes facts,

01:50:36 22  misstates prior testimony.

01:50:37 23            THE WITNESS:  I disagree with your

         18            A.   I haven't seen any data,

         19            given the vast amounts of

         20            information that I have seen

         21            there.

         22            Q.   But this is not data; this

         23            is basic sequence of operation

01:51:29 24            of an oven --

01:51:29 25            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.


                                                                127










01:51:29  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:51:29  2            Q.   And why is that?)

01:51:29  3            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative,

01:51:31  4  unintelligible, vague and ambiguous, incomplete

01:51:33  5  hypothetical, form.

01:51:34  6            THE WITNESS:  So you're asking me if I

01:51:35  7  have attempted.  I have indeed attempted.  You were

01:51:38  8  asking me if I have attempted, if I have attempted.

01:51:42  9  You've used that descriptive; correct?  And I

01:51:45 10  believe I have attempted.

01:51:47 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:51:47 12        Q.  You have attempted what?

01:51:49 13        A.  I'm answering your question.  I have

01:51:50 14  attempted, in the affirmative.

01:51:53 15        Q.  Have you attempted to understand how this

01:51:55 16  oven operates on a basic level?

01:51:58 17            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:52:01 18            THE WITNESS:  I have indeed.

01:52:02 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:52:03 20        Q.  Have you attempted to understand the

01:52:05 21  sequence of operations of this oven?

01:52:08 22            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:52:13 23            THE WITNESS:  I believe I have.

01:52:15 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:52:15 25        Q.  And what is your understanding of the


                                                                128










01:52:16  1  sequence of operation of this oven?

01:52:21  2            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:52:22  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:52:23  4        Q.  And let's start one step at a time.

01:52:25  5            What happens when the door of the oven is

01:52:28  6  open?

01:52:31  7            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered,

01:52:31  8  incomplete hypothetical, vague and ambiguous, form.

01:52:37  9            THE WITNESS:  Obviously, what happens is

01:52:41 10  stated here (indicating).

01:52:43 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:52:44 12        Q.  Yes.  I want to know if you understand

01:52:46 13  that.

01:52:46 14        A.  I understand, again as I mentioned, the

01:52:50 15  abstract form of its operation.  As I mentioned, I

01:52:55 16  haven't obtained any data, variables, analysis that

01:53:04 17  comes back to that question.

01:53:06 18        Q.  What data would you need to understand how

01:53:10 19  the oven operates?

01:53:13 20        A.  Well, for example, we talked about some

01:53:16 21  descriptors before here as M3.  I don't have

01:53:20 22  those -- that explained here, and this -- you

01:53:24 23  sending this to me today.  So I don't have those --

01:53:28 24  that information.

01:53:28 25        Q.  Oh, you do.  You have it in your


                                                                129










01:53:31  1  production documents.  You certainly do have that

01:53:33  2  produced to you --

01:53:34  3        A.  Yes.

01:53:34  4        Q.  -- and available to you.

01:53:36  5        A.  And you said the M3 is the motor, the

01:53:39  6  burner motor, or the burner; is that correct?

01:53:43  7        Q.  Yes.

01:53:43  8        A.  And I don't understand how --

01:53:45  9        Q.  Well, you've said that already.

01:53:48 10            What my question is:  Have you attempted

01:53:50 11  to understand the sequence of operation of a DRO2G

01:53:57 12  oven?

01:53:58 13            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:53:59 14            THE WITNESS:  At the abstract level, at

01:54:01 15  the operational level.

01:54:02 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:54:02 17        Q.  But you don't understand what happens --

01:54:05 18  what mechanisms are triggered when a door of the

01:54:08 19  oven is opened, for example?

01:54:10 20        A.  I have not memorized the command sequence

01:54:14 21  of the controller, of the burner, nor the oven.

01:54:18 22        Q.  I'm not asking you whether you memorized

01:54:20 23  it or not.

01:54:21 24            What happens when the door -- do you

01:54:23 25  understand what happens when the door is opened?  It


                                                                130










01:54:26  1  trips a relay in the door.

01:54:28  2            Do you understand that?

01:54:28  3        A.  Yes.

01:54:29  4        Q.  What is the impact of the relay being

01:54:32  5  tripped; do you understand that?

01:54:33  6        A.  There are multiple functions when that

01:54:36  7  happens.

01:54:36  8        Q.  Okay.  What are the multiple functions

01:54:39  9  that happen?

01:54:39 10        A.  One is the light turns on.

01:54:41 11        Q.  And?

01:54:42 12        A.  The burner switches off --

01:54:45 13        Q.  Okay.

01:54:46 14        A.  -- et cetera, et cetera.  Now --

01:54:48 15        Q.  And does the burner motor continue to burn

01:54:51 16  when the burner switch is off?

01:54:54 17        A.  No, it doesn't.

01:54:55 18        Q.  So your understanding is there's no purge

01:54:58 19  cycle when the burner turns off?

01:55:02 20        A.  That is unclear to me.

01:55:04 21        Q.  Okay.  And is it your understanding that

01:55:06 22  the draft inducer doesn't continue to work when the

01:55:09 23  door is opened?

01:55:12 24        A.  That isn't clear to me either.

01:55:15 25        Q.  Okay.  But all of that is laid out here in


                                                                131










01:55:17  1  the sequence of operations; it's just not clear to

01:55:21  2  you because you haven't studied it?

01:55:23  3            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

01:55:23  4  argumentative.

01:55:24  5            THE WITNESS:  Again, I haven't studied it.

01:55:28  6  I don't know with granularity -- that's the third

01:55:31  7  time I'm saying that -- and I understand the

01:55:34  8  operation at an abstract level.

01:55:36  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:55:36 10        Q.  And not understanding the granular level

01:55:40 11  at which this oven works does not impact your

01:55:43 12  opinions one way or the other?

01:55:44 13        A.  Can you repeat the question, please?

01:55:46 14        Q.  Not understanding how this oven operates

01:55:50 15  on a granular level does not impact the opinions

01:55:53 16  you've rendered in this case; is that what you're

01:55:56 17  saying?

01:55:56 18        A.  Okay.  So I did not say I don't understand

01:56:00 19  it; it's just that I haven't put an effort in

01:56:04 20  reviewing this information.

01:56:05 21        Q.  Okay.  Let's move on to your visit to the

01:56:23 22  Albertsons on September 27, 2016.

01:56:24 23            What was the purpose of your visit?

01:56:26 24        A.  I think the general purpose was to visibly

01:56:34 25  see the bakery, see roughly where the oven was


                                                                132










01:56:41  1  located, because when we arrived, there was a

01:56:45  2  replacement, and to basically get a sense of the

01:56:52  3  environment.

01:56:52  4        Q.  Okay.  And who all was present in addition

01:56:57  5  to you at this inspection?

01:56:59  6        A.  Mr. Jarchi was there, Ms. Frederick was

01:57:06  7  there, I believe, and Ms. Julie Lee.

01:57:13  8        Q.  Anybody else?

01:57:14  9        A.  I think there was another gentleman

01:57:17 10  taking -- if I remember, there was another

01:57:21 11  gentleman.  We signed on his sheet.  I'm not sure

01:57:25 12  who that was.  That's all I could remember.

01:57:29 13        Q.  Was he another expert, do you think?

01:57:31 14        A.  I don't believe so.  I'm not sure.

01:57:35 15        Q.  You don't know one way or the other who it

01:57:38 16  was?

01:57:38 17        A.  No.

01:57:38 18        Q.  Okay.  Was Dr. Jones there?

01:57:40 19        A.  I'm not sure.

01:57:41 20        Q.  Dr. Gill?

01:57:44 21        A.  I don't believe -- again, I'm not sure.

01:57:48 22  I'm not sure.

01:57:48 23        Q.  Were there any employees of Albertsons

01:57:51 24  other than Julie Lee?

01:57:55 25        A.  They were indeed working at the time.


                                                                133










01:57:59  1        Q.  Did you --

01:57:59  2        A.  No, not that I recall.

01:58:01  3        Q.  Did you speak to anyone else?

01:58:03  4        A.  Not that I recall.

01:58:04  5        Q.  Did you speak to Marvin Byrd?

01:58:07  6        A.  Not that I recall.

01:58:08  7        Q.  Okay.  And how long did this inspection

01:58:15  8  last?

01:58:16  9        A.  Again, probably one hour.

01:58:19 10        Q.  Okay.  You've billed nine hours and 45

01:58:23 11  minutes for this inspection.

01:58:24 12            So does that refresh your recollection as

01:58:30 13  to how long you were there at the inspection or --

01:58:33 14        A.  Does that include drive time?  I'm --

01:58:36 15        Q.  So it would include drive time in your

01:58:38 16  billings?

01:58:39 17        A.  At that time, yes.

01:58:40 18        Q.  So to the best of your recollection, how

01:58:45 19  long were you at the Albertsons for this particular

01:58:48 20  inspection?

01:58:49 21            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:58:52 22            THE WITNESS:  I believe from memory it was

01:58:54 23  about an hour, but it could have been longer; it

01:58:56 24  could have been shorter.

01:58:58  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:58:58  2        Q.  I'm just trying to understand the

01:59:01  3  nine-hour billings for the inspection.

01:59:03  4        A.  Sure, sure.

01:59:04  5        Q.  You don't know one way or the other how

01:59:06  6  you spent the other eight hours and 45 minutes?

01:59:10  7            MR. JARCHI:  That's vague and ambiguous,

01:59:13  8  misstates testimony.

01:59:14  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

01:59:14 10        Q.  You were there for an hour --

01:59:16 11        A.  Yes.

01:59:17 12        Q.  -- but you billed for nine hours and 45

01:59:20 13  minutes.

01:59:20 14        A.  Yes.

01:59:21 15        Q.  So do you know what you did for the

01:59:22 16  balance of that time that you billed towards that

01:59:24 17  inspection?

01:59:25 18            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

01:59:26 19            THE WITNESS:  Well, if I billed nine hours

01:59:30 20  and 45 minutes, I probably drove two, three hours

01:59:33 21  there and back.  It seems to me I may have been

01:59:37 22  there for more than an hour, and I probably billed

01:59:41 23  another hour in preparation for getting my materials

01:59:45 24  together, et cetera, et cetera.

01:59:48 25            So it may be, based on that information,


                                                                135










01:59:50  1  that I was there for more than an hour.  Maybe it

01:59:55  2  was two or three hours.  But I don't recall being

01:59:56  3  there for more than three hours.  Maybe it was two

02:00:00  4  hours, but it didn't feel like it was a big

02:00:03  5  afternoon block or anything like that.

02:00:05  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:00:05  7        Q.  So anywhere between one and two hours is

02:00:09  8  what you're --

02:00:09  9        A.  I think so.  I think so.

02:00:11 10        Q.  Okay.  And what did you do during that one

02:00:16 11  or two hours that you were there at the Albertsons?

02:00:20 12        A.  So during that time, I took some

02:00:23 13  measurements of the location of the bakery.  I spoke

02:00:32 14  with Ms. Julie Lee to get a better sense of the

02:00:37 15  location of the carbon monoxide detector.  That's

02:00:49 16  basically it.

02:01:04 17            MR. TAYAB:  Let me hand you Exhibit 17.

         18            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 17was

         19            marked for identification by the

         20            deposition reporter and is attached

         21            hereto.)

         22  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:01:07 23        Q.  Would you please identify that document

02:01:09 24  for the record.

02:01:10 25        A.  Sure.  This is a dimensional Math-Berry


                                                                136










02:01:19  1  course showing the perimeter of the bakery,

02:01:27  2  identifying the various vents in the space.

02:01:31  3        Q.  And did you draw this?

02:01:33  4        A.  Yes.

02:01:34  5        Q.  Did you draw it when you were at the

02:01:37  6  bakery?

02:01:38  7        A.  Yes.

02:01:38  8        Q.  Okay.  Now, if you will, please, help me

02:01:44  9  understand what it is you've drawn there and in as

02:01:48 10  much detail as you possibly can.

02:01:50 11        A.  Sure.  There's a box, and within it there

02:01:57 12  are four vents that were in the bakery location,

02:02:03 13  Vent 1, Vent 2, Vent 3, Vent 4 as noted, and I have

02:02:08 14  taken their locations superimposed on the perimeter

02:02:15 15  of this bakery.

02:02:16 16        Q.  And where is the location of the oven

02:02:22 17  here?

02:02:22 18        A.  I don't know, because when I was there, it

02:02:24 19  was replaced.

02:02:25 20        Q.  Okay.  Where is the location of the

02:02:27 21  replacement oven?

02:02:28 22        A.  I didn't note that.

02:02:30 23        Q.  Okay.  And why is that?

02:02:31 24        A.  Because it's totally irrelevant.

02:02:33 25        Q.  But wouldn't you presume that the


                                                                137










02:02:35  1  replacement oven went in the same location as the

02:02:39  2  original oven?

02:02:39  3        A.  No, I didn't presume that.

02:02:41  4        Q.  Okay.  Did you inquire as to whether it

02:02:44  5  was in the same location or in a different location?

02:02:46  6        A.  No.  It was in the vicinity of where the

02:02:49  7  replacement was, but I knew that it was replaced and

02:02:53  8  it wasn't in the exact same location; hence, I

02:02:55  9  didn't use that as my reference point.

02:02:58 10        Q.  And how do you know it was not in the

02:03:01 11  exact same location?

02:03:02 12        A.  Because it's a replacement oven.

02:03:06 13        Q.  And so?

02:03:08 14        A.  By definition, if it's replaced, it's not

02:03:11 15  going to be in the exact same location.

02:03:15 16        Q.  Okay.  You're saying it shifted a couple

02:03:18 17  inches or something like that?

02:03:19 18        A.  Exactly.  The new oven could have

02:03:19 19  different dimensions.  I believe it was a different

02:03:21 20  brand, et cetera, et cetera.

02:03:23 21        Q.  Okay.  Now, you've got the four vents

02:03:26 22  here.

02:03:26 23            You've also got something towards the

02:03:30 24  bottom right, which is called a Return; is that

02:03:31 25  correct?


                                                                138










02:03:31  1        A.  Yes.

02:03:32  2        Q.  All right.  With respect to Vent 1, what

02:03:39  3  is Vent 1?

02:03:40  4        A.  Vent 1 is a ceiling vent.

02:03:55  5        Q.  Okay.  Now, I want you to explain that

02:03:58  6  drawing you've made in conjunction with certain

02:04:01  7  pictures that you may have taken, okay?  So let me

02:04:04  8  hand you what's Exhibit 18, and if you will, please

02:04:08  9  identify that for the record.

02:04:09 10            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 18 was

02:04:09 11            marked for identification by the

02:04:09 12            deposition reporter and is attached

02:04:09 13            hereto.)

02:04:15 14            THE WITNESS:  So I'm holding Exhibit 18,

02:04:17 15  pictures that I took during the Albertsons

02:04:22 16  inspection, and my set of photographs, so vents,

02:04:30 17  ceiling vents and a return vent held up with an air

02:04:36 18  flow needle.

02:04:37 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:04:37 20        Q.  Okay.  And all of these photographs are

02:04:39 21  the ones you took?

02:04:40 22        A.  That's correct.

02:04:41 23        Q.  Okay.  Now, going back to your handwritten

02:04:44 24  drawing.  We were talking about Vent 1.

02:04:56 25            Can you identify Vent 1 in the photographs?


                                                                139










02:04:59  1        A.  No, I cannot.

02:05:00  2        Q.  Can you identify what that device is on

02:05:05  3  the top right-hand corner of the first page you're

02:05:08  4  holding up?

02:05:09  5        A.  Sure.  That's my hand.  That's my meter,

02:05:14  6  air flow meter that measures flow of air at various

02:05:19  7  locations.  Could measure it outdoor, indoor, on

02:05:20  8  vent, et cetera.

02:05:20  9        Q.  Okay.  Now, where did you use the data you

02:05:25 10  got from the air flow meter?

02:05:28 11        A.  The data is written on my notes.

02:05:32 12        Q.  Okay.  So you measured the data from the

02:05:35 13  vent and noted it on the handwritten drawing that

02:05:39 14  you have here?

02:05:39 15        A.  That's correct.

02:05:40 16        Q.  Getting back to Vent 1, you make a

02:05:44 17  notation here which says Vent 1, 20 inches by 20

02:05:50 18  inches, and then you've got something in

02:05:50 19  parentheticals.

02:05:54 20            What is that?

02:05:55 21        A.  So Vent 1, 20 by 20 is the physical

02:05:58 22  diameter of the vent.

02:05:59 23        Q.  You mean physical dimension of the vent?

02:06:02 24        A.  Dimension of the vent, that's correct.

02:06:05 25  And I have in parentheses, air from .3, forward


                                                                140










02:06:08  1  arrows .7 meters per second.

02:06:10  2        Q.  What does that mean?

02:06:11  3        A.  So that means that I measured air flow of

02:06:14  4  that vent in that range.

02:06:17  5        Q.  And what does that match?

02:06:21  6        A.  Meters per second.

02:06:23  7        Q.  Meters per second.

02:06:26  8            So are we to understand that the air flow

02:06:28  9  from Vent 1 when you measured it ranged between .3

02:06:32 10  and .7 meters per second?

02:06:35 11        A.  My measurement range, that range, because

02:06:43 12  there are sitting grills on the vent and that was

02:06:45 13  the range that I measured.

02:06:46 14        Q.  Is this air going out of the vent or into

02:06:56 15  the vent?

02:06:57 16        A.  Out of the vent.

02:06:58 17        Q.  So this is air blowing out of the vent?

02:07:04 18        A.  Correct.

02:07:04 19        Q.  And how did you take this measurement?

02:07:08 20        A.  Using my handheld air flow meter.

02:07:11 21        Q.  Let me -- I'm trying to look for something

02:07:14 22  here.  Give me one second.

02:07:14 23        A.  Sure.

02:07:14 24            (Whereupon, there was a brief

02:07:14 25            pause in the proceedings.)


                                                                141










02:08:15  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:08:15  2        Q.  Now, did you measure the air flow at just

02:08:18  3  one spot, or did you measure them at multiple spots

02:08:23  4  of the vent?

02:08:24  5        A.  So each vent was measured at multiple

02:08:28  6  spots, locations of the same vent; hence, I have the

02:08:31  7  range that I obtained.

02:08:32  8        Q.  Okay.  And then for Vent 2 you did the

02:08:38  9  same thing?

02:08:38 10        A.  That's correct.

02:08:39 11        Q.  And you got a range of air flows from 0 to

02:08:43 12  .3 meters per second?

02:08:45 13        A.  That's correct.

02:08:45 14        Q.  Okay.  And was this when the HVAC system

02:08:50 15  was cycling on and off?

02:08:52 16        A.  The HVAC system was on and I have no

02:09:01 17  reason to believe it was off.

02:09:04 18        Q.  Okay.  You're getting a value of 0 for

02:09:08 19  Vent 2, and then I presume at some point you got a

02:09:11 20  value of .3.

02:09:13 21        A.  It was momentarily.  As I was moving past

02:09:19 22  the grill, it would register, because it was -- the

02:09:21 23  grill is, as you can see from the photographs,

02:09:24 24  blocking the little spindles on the fan from

02:09:28 25  fanning, so you have to adjust it to obtain some


                                                                142










02:09:32  1  operation.

02:09:36  2        Q.  Okay.  So you could have the same vent,

02:09:38  3  but you could get different values by the manner in

02:09:41  4  which you're holding the apparatus to the vent; is

02:09:45  5  that correct?

02:09:45  6        A.  Effectively, yes; hence, that range of

02:09:49  7  values is noted here (indicating).

02:09:52  8        Q.  Okay.  So at Vent 3 you say air is equal

02:09:56  9  to 0.

02:09:57 10            So you got no air flow through Vent 3?

02:10:01 11        A.  Correct.

02:10:01 12        Q.  Now, are these vents interconnected, do

02:10:05 13  you know?

02:10:05 14        A.  I don't know.  I didn't inspect the

02:10:09 15  internals.

02:10:09 16        Q.  So you didn't go up past the roof to look

02:10:14 17  at the way in which the venting was connected?

02:10:18 18        A.  That's correct.

02:10:19 19        Q.  And then at Vent 4, you call it the

02:10:22 20  Return.

02:10:22 21            What does that mean?

02:10:24 22        A.  That is a return vent.  It's a larger vent

02:10:32 23  that pulls air in, and the data for that, as we can

02:10:41 24  see on Page 4 of Exhibit 18, specifically the last

02:10:52 25  three digits of the bottom left, or let's say bottom


                                                                143










02:10:57  1  right, Picture 136, has an air flow, a return air

02:11:02  2  flow of 2 meters per second.

02:11:04  3        Q.  Which means it's air flowing from the

02:11:08  4  bakery into the vent?

02:11:10  5        A.  That's correct.

02:11:10  6        Q.  The other three we looked at, air flow was

02:11:12  7  flowing from the vents into the bakery?

02:11:15  8        A.  That's correct.

02:11:15  9        Q.  Okay.  And at Vent 3 you got no air flow;

02:11:25 10  correct?

02:11:26 11        A.  That's correct.

02:11:26 12        Q.  And at Vent 4 you got a return, but you

02:11:32 13  haven't noted what the air flow is?

02:11:37 14        A.  I haven't; however, the photographs have

02:11:44 15  that data on there.

02:11:48 16        Q.  Which is 20 --

02:11:48 17        A.  I see 2.0 meters per second, and the other

02:11:57 18  photograph ending with 130 and 144, I cannot make

02:12:07 19  out.

02:12:11 20        Q.  In other words, Vent 4 is pulling a lot

02:12:21 21  more air out than Vents 1, 2 and 3 are pushing in;

02:12:28 22  is that correct?

02:12:35 23        A.  If I was to take 136 as the intake at

02:12:44 24  2 meters per second, summate the four vents, there

02:12:58 25  is a gap of some amount of flow.


                                                                144










02:13:05  1        Q.  So it's almost double -- it is double,

02:13:07  2  isn't it?

02:13:08  3        A.  It is double; however, I'm not sure if

02:13:14  4  there are other vents that were drawing up air using

02:13:18  5  the same system of return.

02:13:19  6        Q.  And to the bottom right of the figure,

02:13:23  7  you've got a fifth box, and that says Return.

02:13:28  8            What is that?

02:13:38  9        A.  So that is the return vent, 21 1/2 by

02:13:45 10  21 1/2 return vent at the bottom.

02:13:48 11        Q.  And then what is Vent 4 --

02:13:50 12        A.  The discrepancy.

02:13:52 13        Q.  -- return?

02:13:53 14        A.  There must be another vent that was

02:13:57 15  missed.

02:14:04 16        Q.  So clarify that for me.  So you're saying

02:14:07 17  there are four vents that are blowing in air, and

02:14:10 18  there is one vent sucking in air; is that right?

02:14:16 19        A.  I believe so, but Vent 4 that's blowing

02:14:21 20  out air, the Vent 4 that is presumably blowing out

02:14:28 21  air, I haven't noted its flow rate.

02:14:30 22        Q.  Yeah, but you pointed to the picture and

02:14:32 23  said it's 2.0.

02:14:34 24        A.  That was for the return.

02:14:36 25        Q.  But you said -- Vent 4 you then noted in


                                                                145










02:14:41  1  the parentheticals that it is a return.

02:14:43  2        A.  That should not be Vent 4 there.  That

02:14:47  3  must be a typo.

02:14:49  4        Q.  So what do you think is the correct --

02:14:50  5  what should have been the correct notation there?

02:14:52  6        A.  Vent 4 should equal whatever the diameter

02:14:57  7  of the vent is -- I didn't know that -- and the flow

02:15:02  8  rate.  I must have missed it.

02:15:04  9        Q.  Okay.  So you're saying Vent 4 is not a

02:15:08 10  return but the return really is the one to the

02:15:10 11  bottom right; is that right?

02:15:12 12        A.  Seems to be the case, yes.

02:15:14 13        Q.  Okay.  And you don't have the flow data

02:15:18 14  for Vent 4?

02:15:19 15        A.  That seems to be the case.  That correct.

02:15:20 16        Q.  Now, did you use this data in any way?

02:15:27 17        A.  No.

02:15:27 18        Q.  Why?

02:15:28 19        A.  If I'm going to an inspection, I typically

02:15:33 20  do that so I don't have to come again and retake,

02:15:38 21  but given that I missed that, I would have had to

02:15:41 22  return if I had to do any analysis regarding air

02:15:43 23  flow.

02:15:43 24        Q.  Now, did you do a calculation of the air

02:15:48 25  change rate for this bakery?


                                                                146










02:15:50  1        A.  No.

02:15:50  2        Q.  And so you're saying the only reason you

02:15:59  3  have this data is that on inspections as a matter of

02:16:03  4  course you generate data such as this; is that

02:16:07  5  correct?

02:16:07  6        A.  Knowing what I knew about the situation

02:16:09  7  where there was a subject oven in a bakery space, I

02:16:15  8  had my air flow meter with me, I had my tape measure

02:16:19  9  with me.  The subject oven wasn't there, so I chose

02:16:23 10  to obtain as much information as possible from the

02:16:27 11  environment.

02:16:27 12        Q.  But you're not using this data for your

02:16:28 13  opinions?

02:16:28 14        A.  I have not used this data for my opinions.

02:16:33 15        Q.  Now, have you looked at dimensions that

02:16:37 16  others who have done previous inspections of the

02:16:41 17  bakery have reported on the dimension of the bakery?

02:16:41 18        A.  Of the bakery itself?

02:16:42 19        Q.  Yes.

02:16:46 20        A.  I know on the day there were other photos

02:16:49 21  taken with measurements.  I've used that to

02:16:52 22  determine the distance of certain key locations such

02:16:58 23  as a co detector, where it was stored in the drawer,

02:17:02 24  cabinet, such as opposite the oven on the wall

02:17:10 25  distance.  But other than that, I haven't analyzed


                                                                147










02:17:14  1  other information.

02:17:15  2        Q.  Now, who are the others recording

02:17:18  3  dimension information?

02:17:19  4        A.  I believe there was another gentleman on

02:17:24  5  this same day that I mentioned that took the roll

02:17:27  6  call.  I think he may have taken some measurements

02:17:35  7  and I used these pictures that he took.

02:17:35  8        Q.  Ah.  Now, where are those pictures?

02:17:35  9        A.  They are somewhere in my file, I believe.

02:17:44 10        Q.  I don't think we've seen those pictures.

02:17:51 11        A.  Let me see.

02:17:53 12            MR. TAYAB:  Do you know?

02:17:53 13            MR. JARCHI:  I think they were produced in

02:17:55 14  discovery if you have them.

02:17:57 15            MR. TAYAB:  But do you know who took those

02:17:59 16  pictures?

02:17:59 17            MR. JARCHI:  I don't.

02:18:00 18            MR. TAYAB:  Do you know who the other

02:18:02 19  person was at the inspection?

02:18:04 20            MR. JARCHI:  I don't.  I could look and

02:18:06 21  try to figure it out.

02:18:06 22            MR. TAYAB:  Would you?

02:18:09 23            MR. JARCHI:  Yes.

02:18:09 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:18:10 25        Q.  And you reviewed those pictures for what


                                                                148










02:18:12  1  purpose?

02:18:12  2        A.  As I said, to understand the distance

02:18:16  3  of -- distance from the subject oven, again, from to

02:18:22  4  the wall where Julie Lee mentioned that she plugged

02:18:26  5  it in in February of 2009 and the distance to where

02:18:32  6  she mentioned she placed it in a cabinet or a drawer

02:18:36  7  and to understand those locations.

02:18:38  8        Q.  Okay.  Now, if you will flip Exhibit 17 to

02:18:46  9  the reverse side, there's another sketch that has

02:18:51 10  been drawn.

02:18:51 11            Who made that sketch?

02:18:53 12        A.  I did.

02:18:54 13        Q.  And you made that during the same

02:18:57 14  inspection?

02:18:58 15        A.  Yes.

02:18:59 16        Q.  What is it a sketch of?

02:19:05 17        A.  The bakery -- okay.  This is a sketch of

02:19:11 18  the bakery, but it's not the full bakery.  It's part

02:19:14 19  of the bakery.  There's a funny wall piece that

02:19:21 20  disembarks different color tile, and I just mapped

02:19:25 21  out that piece of the bakery which, if you can see

02:19:27 22  on the first page of Exhibit 17, has like a --

02:19:33 23  somewhat of a kink.

02:19:38 24        Q.  Are you talking about the top right side?

02:19:44 25        A.  The top middle side.


                                                                149










02:19:48  1        Q.  Okay.

02:19:52  2        A.  So, effectively, this is the magnification

02:19:55  3  of that space.  And I have taken those points,

02:19:58  4  random points in that space to analyze the air flow

02:20:03  5  with my meter.

02:20:05  6        Q.  Okay.  Now, this magnified spot that

02:20:10  7  you're talking about, is it to the front of the

02:20:12  8  bakery or the back of the bakery?

02:20:15  9        A.  It's toward the front of the bakery.

02:20:17 10        Q.  So this is the customer-facing side?

02:20:19 11        A.  Yes.

02:20:19 12        Q.  Okay.

02:20:25 13        A.  The wall is here, wall to the external

02:20:27 14  space.  That is a brick wall of the supermarket.  I

02:20:30 15  believe it's a brick wall, if I recall correctly.

02:20:34 16        Q.  Okay.  So you've got three points here,

02:20:38 17  Point A, Point B and Point C.

02:20:40 18            What do they depict?

02:20:41 19        A.  They depict effectively what I'm doing

02:20:45 20  with these photographs over here on Exhibit 18, Page

02:20:55 21  Number 5, and it shows the locations.  I'm not sure

02:21:10 22  if the photos corroborate these points, but it shows

02:21:17 23  the time of taking an air flow measurement.

02:21:23 24        Q.  So, essentially, this location is from the

02:21:27 25  bakery looking out into the store; is that correct?


                                                                150










02:21:31  1        A.  You're referring to Exhibit 17, Page 2?

02:21:34  2        Q.  Yes.

02:21:35  3        A.  Yes.

02:21:37  4        Q.  And what did you determine from your air

02:21:41  5  flow measurements of those three points?

02:21:43  6        A.  The air flow was zero meters per second,

02:21:49  7  and that's basically it.

02:21:50  8        Q.  So for all three points, the air flow was

02:21:55  9  0 meters per second?

02:21:56 10        A.  That's what the meter was reading,

02:21:59 11  correct.

02:21:59 12        Q.  And what does that mean to you?

02:22:01 13        A.  It means at that specific point there was

02:22:06 14  0 meters per second flowing through my meter.

02:22:09 15        Q.  And would that mean that there is zero air

02:22:16 16  flowing into the bakery or out of the bakery?

02:22:20 17        A.  I would not describe it that way.  I would

02:22:24 18  describe it as at that point that there was no air

02:22:29 19  flow at that specific absolute location of the

02:22:30 20  bakery.

02:22:31 21        Q.  Okay.  So at that point in time, there was

02:22:33 22  no air flow when you measured it at Point A, B and

02:22:38 23  C?

02:22:38 24        A.  Correct.

02:22:38 25        Q.  But you're not saying one way or the other


                                                                151










02:22:42  1  whether air flows into the bakery or air flows out

02:22:51  2  of the bakery or if it's static?

02:22:51  3        A.  I didn't undertake that analysis because

02:22:54  4  one would have to do a lot more work to conclude if

02:22:59  5  it's moving in, moving out.  But as a -- as a -- how

02:23:09  6  can I put it.

02:23:09  7            I noticed -- I actually felt that there

02:23:12  8  was no air flow.  It felt somewhat stagnant.  I can

02:23:17  9  definitely testify to that.  And I think the points

02:23:20 10  that I mention here shows that.

02:23:22 11            So it wasn't a surprise to me to feel that

02:23:25 12  it was stagnant and to have the actual data that it

02:23:29 13  was stagnant.

02:23:30 14        Q.  Now, are you doing any sort of analysis on

02:23:33 15  the flow of air through the bakery?

02:23:35 16            MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  Other than what

02:23:37 17  was just stated?  Argumentative.

02:23:39 18            THE WITNESS:  In terms of an analysis as a

02:23:41 19  work product?

02:23:41 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:23:42 21        Q.  Correct.

02:23:43 22        A.  I have not at this point in time.

02:23:45 23        Q.  Are you calculating the air change rate to

02:23:48 24  the bakery at all?

02:23:49 25        A.  Not via this method.


                                                                152










02:23:51  1        Q.  Via any method?

02:23:53  2        A.  No.

02:23:54  3        Q.  So you're not going to calculate the air

02:23:57  4  change rate for the bakery for the purpose of your

02:24:00  5  analysis in this case?

02:24:01  6        A.  I'm not sure, but as I sit here today,

02:24:04  7  that has not been discussed, or yet.

02:24:08  8        Q.  Now, what sort of air flow meter did you

02:24:24  9  use for your measurements?

02:24:50 10        A.  I don't have the make or model off the top

02:24:53 11  of my head.

02:24:54 12        Q.  Now, is it necessary to calibrate that

02:24:58 13  thing before you make measurements?

02:25:00 14        A.  Can you rephrase the question?

02:25:07 15        Q.  Would you need to calibrate the air flow

02:25:12 16  meter before making measurements?

02:25:19 17        A.  I'm not sure if it's in the instruction

02:25:21 18  manual to do so, but possibly.  Actually, one should

02:25:26 19  calibrate most instruments before they attempt an

02:25:29 20  experiment for an analysis like this to have maximum

02:25:33 21  accuracy as possible.  But in this case, I did not

02:25:38 22  calibrate this, nor do I believe it was -- there

02:25:43 23  were instructions to do so.

02:25:44 24        Q.  But either way, you did not calibrate it

02:25:48 25  before your measurements; right?


                                                                153










02:25:50  1        A.  That's correct.  That's correct.

02:25:51  2        Q.  Now, the replacement oven that was in the

02:25:55  3  bakery, did you take a look at that oven?

02:25:59  4        A.  No.

02:25:59  5        Q.  Did you -- did you confirm one way or the

02:26:05  6  other whether that oven was connected to the eyebrow

02:26:10  7  hood?

02:26:10  8        A.  What was the last word?  I didn't

02:26:14  9  understand.

02:26:14 10        Q.  I call it the eyebrow hood, the hood which

02:26:18 11  is right outside the door.

02:26:20 12        A.  I did not inquire.

02:26:22 13        Q.  You did not look at that.

02:26:24 14            Did you look to see if the oven's eyebrow

02:26:28 15  hood was connected to the duct that vents the air to

02:26:32 16  the ceiling?

02:26:33 17        A.  I did not go above the ceiling.

02:26:37 18        Q.  Okay.  Did you go to the roof to take a

02:26:39 19  look at the exhaust fans there?

02:26:41 20        A.  No.

02:27:08 21            MR. TAYAB:  Let's go off the record for a

02:27:10 22  second.

02:27:14 23            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.

02:27:16 24  The time is 2:27 p.m.

                                                                154










02:27:16  1            (Whereupon, a recess was held

02:43:41  2            from 2:27 p.m. to 2:43 p.m.)

02:43:41  3            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the

02:43:42  4  beginning of Video Media Number 3 in the deposition

02:43:46  5  of Dr. Kosmas Galatsis.  Going back on the record.

02:43:51  6  The time is 2:43 p.m.

02:43:54  7            MR. TAYAB:  Welcome back, Dr. Galatsis.

02:43:57  8  I'm going to hand you what I've marked as

02:44:00  9  Exhibit 19, and what was previously been marked as

02:44:04 10  Exhibit 13, okay?  This is Brignola's declaration

02:44:14 11  and his data in Exhibit 13.  If you'll take that and

02:44:17 12  look at it for a moment and I'm going to have some

02:44:21 13  questions on that.

02:44:21 14            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 19 was

02:44:21 15            marked for identification by the

02:44:21 16            deposition reporter and is attached

02:44:21 17            hereto.)

02:44:49 18            (Document reviewed by witness.)

02:44:49 19            (Whereupon, a discussion was held

02:45:16 20            off the stenographic record.)

02:45:16 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:45:17 22        Q.  All right, Doctor, have you had a chance

02:45:19 23  to look at the declaration of Christopher Brignola?

02:45:23 24        A.  Yes.  Thank you.

02:45:24 25        Q.  Have you reviewed this document before?


                                                                155










02:45:26  1        A.  Yes, I have.

02:45:30  2        Q.  Now, is -- strike that.

02:45:44  3            Now, in his declaration, Mr. Brignola is

02:45:48  4  talking about testing that he performed on

02:45:51  5  September 21st and 22nd of 2010; is that correct?

02:45:57  6        A.  Yes.

02:45:58  7        Q.  What do you know about this testing that

02:46:01  8  was done in September of 2010?

02:46:07  9            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

02:46:08 10            THE WITNESS:  Testing was undertaken the

02:46:10 11  21st and 22nd.  I believe on the 21st Mr. Brignola

02:46:17 12  was there per his declaration, Exhibit 19, and he

02:46:23 13  undertook sample measurements of the subject oven,

02:46:34 14  specifically looking at concentrations of carbon

02:46:40 15  monoxide in the bake chamber, but it seems on the

02:46:49 16  21st and the 22nd using a Testo combustion analyzer.

02:46:55 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:46:55 18        Q.  Do you know who else was present at the

02:46:58 19  inspection on the 21st?

02:47:00 20        A.  I believe Mr. Gumbert was there, and I

02:47:08 21  also believe -- reading Mr. Brignola's testimony, I

02:47:15 22  believe Mr. Durazo was there.

02:47:16 23        Q.  Okay.  And do you know how Mr. Brignola

02:47:23 24  performed his testing of the oven?

02:47:26 25            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for a narrative.


                                                                156










02:47:30  1            THE WITNESS:  With respect to what aspect

02:47:33  2  of it?

02:47:33  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:47:33  4        Q.  So how did he conduct the test?  Do you

02:47:36  5  have an understanding of that?

02:47:37  6        A.  In general terms through his testimony,

02:47:39  7  he -- again, he has his combustion analyzer.  He was

02:47:49  8  operating the oven while the combustion analyzer was

02:47:54  9  sampling gases within the oven chamber and was

02:48:01 10  taking data, data points at various times during the

02:48:06 11  procedure.

02:48:07 12        Q.  Okay.  Now, in his declaration at

02:48:11 13  Paragraph 4, he says that:

02:48:13 14                "During the inspection of

02:48:14 15                     the oven in September of 2010,

02:48:17 16                     carbon monoxide measurements

02:48:19 17                     were recorded using a Testo 330-2

02:48:25 18                     Combustion Gas Analyzer and a

02:48:25 19                     Bacharach Monoxor II."

02:48:31 20                     Do you know the location in which

02:48:33 21            the

02:48:34 22            Testo was placed to take the measurements?

02:48:38 23            MR. JARCHI:  Vague as to time, incomplete

02:48:42 24  hypothetical.

02:48:42 25            THE WITNESS:  Based on the photographs


                                                                157










02:48:45  1  that I have seen and his testimony, Mr. Brignola's

02:48:51  2  testimony, I believe he took measurements under the

02:48:55  3  door.  And there was a time when they drilled a hole

02:49:03  4  in the subject oven's door and they placed a probe

02:49:07  5  through that hole to obtain a sample.

02:49:13  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:49:13  7        Q.  Right.  So on the 21st, do you have an

02:49:17  8  understanding as to where he sampled using the Testo

02:49:22  9  330 probe?

02:49:24 10            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

02:49:35 11            THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I believe he was

02:49:39 12  talking measurements in the locations that are

02:49:42 13  mentioned.

02:49:43 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:49:43 15        Q.  Which is where?

02:49:45 16        A.  Definitely under the door.  And at some

02:49:51 17  time he also placed it through the door.

02:49:56 18        Q.  Did he do that on the -- did he place that

02:50:00 19  through the door on the 21st or the 22nd?

02:50:04 20        A.  Again, I recall through his testimony.

02:50:09 21  I'm not sure if he actually remembers when he did

02:50:12 22  that.

02:50:12 23        Q.  When you say "that," the drilling the

02:50:15 24  hole?

02:50:15 25        A.  That's correct.  And I believe he himself


                                                                158










02:50:18  1  does not recall.

02:50:19  2        Q.  Okay.  So does he recall on the 21st where

02:50:23  3  he sampled from?

02:50:25  4        A.  I believe -- I believe so.  I believe it's

02:50:31  5  in line with a notation he has here, edge of door,

02:50:38  6  lower edge of door, which would indicate to me it's

02:50:41  7  at the bottom of the door.

02:50:43  8        Q.  Okay.  And is the probe outside the oven

02:50:45  9  or is it inside the oven where he was sampling?

02:50:48 10            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

02:50:51 11            THE WITNESS:  Again, from the testimony

02:50:53 12  and the pictures I've seen, I understand that the

02:50:55 13  probe is in the oven.

02:50:56 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:50:56 15        Q.  So it's sampling air from inside the oven?

02:51:00 16        A.  Inside the bake chamber, the oven cavity,

02:51:05 17  yes.

02:51:05 18        Q.  So of the lower edge of that door;

02:51:07 19  correct?

02:51:07 20        A.  It seems to be the case per his notes.

02:51:11 21        Q.  His note says "max @ lower edge of door."

02:51:15 22            Do you have an understanding as to what

02:51:17 23  that means?

02:51:17 24        A.  No.

02:51:18 25        Q.  And there are two data points there;


                                                                159










02:51:26  1  correct?  One says "24 PPM CO 350 cycle."

02:51:30  2            Do you see that?

02:51:31  3        A.  Yes.

02:51:31  4        Q.  Did do you know which sensor was used to

02:51:34  5  make that measurement?

02:51:35  6        A.  To make which measurement?

02:51:37  7        Q.  The 24 PPM carbon monoxide 350 degrees

02:51:42  8  Fahrenheit cycle.

02:51:43  9        A.  Based on his notes, it doesn't seem to be

02:51:48 10  identified.

02:51:48 11        Q.  So we don't know if it's the Bacharach or

02:51:55 12  the Testo device that made that measurement; is that

02:51:58 13  right?

02:51:58 14        A.  As I'm looking at the data here, that's

02:52:00 15  correct.  All I can conclude from this area of his

02:52:06 16  Page 1 is that the 218 COAF is from the Testo

02:52:15 17  because I know for a fact that the monoxor detector

02:52:19 18  he used does not calculate COAF.

02:52:26 19        Q.  Now, do you know when the Testo device

02:52:30 20  that was used was last calibrated?

02:52:34 21        A.  There was some discussion I recall on that

02:52:38 22  point in his testimony, and I recall he was

02:52:43 23  mentioning that it is calibrated annually, I

02:52:48 24  believe, and that Vulga Gray (sic), I think it's his

02:52:54 25  employer --


                                                                160










02:52:54  1        Q.  Vollmer-Gray, you mean?

02:52:57  2        A.  Vollmer-Gray, excuse me, yes -- takes care

02:52:58  3  of that, and they -- again, I'm paraphrasing --

02:53:01  4  maintain the detectors in a workable condition.

02:53:05  5        Q.  Okay.  Now, for the second sample here,

02:53:10  6  which says "28 PPM CO" and "218 COAF," there is no

02:53:17  7  measurement for carbon dioxide, is there?

02:53:28  8        A.  I wouldn't expect there to be.

02:53:31  9        Q.  Well, how do you get a COAF number without

02:53:42 10  carbon dioxide?

02:53:43 11        A.  You get it via the Testo instrument that

02:53:45 12  measures oxygen instead.

02:53:48 13        Q.  Okay.  Now, is there an oxygen concentration

02:53:50 14  here?

02:53:50 15        A.  Reading on his notes here, doesn't seem to

02:53:53 16  be.

02:53:54 17        Q.  Okay.  Does he record his oxygen

02:53:56 18  concentration anywhere --

02:53:58 19        A.  He records it --

02:53:59 20        Q.  -- that you know of?

02:54:00 21        A.  He records it on -- somebody recorded it

02:54:03 22  on these photographs.

02:54:04 23        Q.  Now, is it your understanding that that

02:54:07 24  photograph is a photograph of the Testo device that

02:54:11 25  Mr. Brignola used?


                                                                161










02:54:13  1        A.  That's correct.

02:54:14  2        Q.  Okay.  And so let me see what you're

02:54:20  3  pointing to.

02:54:21  4        A.  It's actually Exhibit 42 of Gumbert in

02:54:25  5  11-18-14.

02:54:27  6        Q.  So this data which says 25 PPM and 329

02:54:32  7  COAF, it is your opinion that this is a picture of

02:54:38  8  the Testo analyzer that Brignola used?

02:54:44  9        A.  Yes.

02:54:46 10        Q.  Okay.  And how did you confirm that?

02:54:51 11        A.  Again, via his testimony; that he

02:54:56 12  mentioned he was using a Testo combustion analyzer.

02:55:01 13        Q.  Okay.  But do you see anything in his

02:55:03 14  notes or in his declaration that correlates with

02:55:07 15  those numbers?

02:55:10 16        A.  So anything in his notes that correlates

02:55:13 17  with this photograph.

02:55:15 18        Q.  Correct.  Is there anything in his notes

02:55:17 19  which says 25 PPM CO?

02:55:21 20        A.  I believe what he's capturing here are two

02:55:25 21  different time points, points in time where he's

02:55:29 22  taken a notation and at another point someone's

02:55:33 23  taken a photograph.

02:55:34 24        Q.  Okay.  And this is a photograph taken of

02:55:40 25  Brignola's device?


                                                                162










02:55:40  1        A.  I believe so.  That's the way I understand

02:55:42  2  it.

02:55:42  3        Q.  Okay.  Now, in your declaration, if you'll

02:56:11  4  pull that up.  That's Exhibit 2.

02:56:15  5        A.  Thank you.

02:56:15  6        Q.  If you'll go to Paragraph 26.

02:56:40  7        A.  Okay.

02:56:45  8        Q.  Now, is this the same paragraph you have

02:56:50  9  cited to in your declaration?

02:56:53 10        A.  Yes.

02:56:54 11        Q.  Now, with respect to that data point we're

02:57:20 12  talking about, do you know what the oven temperature

02:57:24 13  was set to when that data point was taken?

02:57:31 14        A.  I believe based on his notes here, he does

02:57:38 15  mention 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  I believe he was in

02:57:45 16  that vicinity, 375, and I think 400 was mentioned in

02:57:51 17  Brignola's testimony.

02:57:52 18        Q.  But for the first day of testing on the

02:57:55 19  21st, what temperature was the oven set at for

02:58:01 20  making the measurements?

02:58:02 21        A.  Well, he's noted here 350 degrees

02:58:07 22  Fahrenheit, so I am sort of assuming that that was

02:58:15 23  the set temperature.

02:58:18 24        Q.  And do you have any understanding as to

02:58:20 25  what the bake chamber temperature was when that


                                                                163










02:58:27  1  measurement was taken?

02:58:27  2        A.  When that measurement was taken, the only

02:58:39  3  data that we can corroborate temperature with this

02:58:42  4  meter is the second day, as provided to us by the

02:58:47  5  recent data that we've obtained.

02:58:49  6        Q.  But with respect to that 25 PPM data, the

02:58:53  7  picture that you were pointing to that you say

02:58:57  8  Brignola took on the first day of testing, you

02:59:01  9  cannot tell what the bake chamber temperature was

02:59:04 10  for that data point; correct?

02:59:05 11        A.  Definitively, I do not know the exact

02:59:09 12  temperature of the bake chamber.  I'm assuming it's

02:59:12 13  operating and he is obtaining these values and

02:59:17 14  taking key data points at certain times that he

02:59:21 15  feels is appropriate.

02:59:23 16        Q.  But you don't know one way or the other

02:59:25 17  what the temperature of the bake chamber is?

02:59:29 18        A.  I was not there.

02:59:30 19        Q.  Okay.  But from whatever you've reviewed

02:59:32 20  in the record, you don't know one way or the other

02:59:35 21  what the temperature of the bake chamber was for

02:59:36 22  that particular data point for 25 PPM; correct?

02:59:40 23            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

02:59:40 24            THE WITNESS:  Seems to be correct, yes.

                                                                164










02:59:43  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

02:59:44  2        Q.  Okay.  Now, is there any data from

02:59:44  3  Brignola's Bacharach monoxor instrument for the

03:00:05  4  first day of testing that you're aware of?

03:00:06  5        A.  Any data.  Not that I recall.

03:00:26  6        Q.  And the second data point which says here

03:00:29  7  in this handwritten note 28 CO PPM and 218 COAF that

03:00:35  8  he took, was this also, to your mind, taken when the

03:00:42  9  oven was set at 350 degrees Fahrenheit?

         10            MR. JARCHI:  Can I have that question read

         11  back, please.

         12            (The record was read as follows:

         13            Q.   And the second data point

         14            which says here in this

         15            handwritten note that says 28

         16            CO PPM and 218 COAF that he took,

         17            was this also, to your mind,

         18            taken when the oven was set at

03:00:46 19            350 degrees Fahrenheit?)

03:01:09 20            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, form.

03:01:14 21            THE WITNESS:  I believe it was.

03:01:15 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:01:30 23        Q.  Now, in his declaration, Brignola says in

03:01:35 24  Paragraph 4:

03:01:37 25                "28 parts per million CO was


                                                                165










03:01:41  1            measured at the lower edge of

03:01:42  2            the oven with the oven

03:01:44  3            temperature control set to

03:01:46  4            375-degrees."

03:01:48  5            Now, do you know when that data point was

03:01:52  6  generated?

03:02:08  7        A.  It may indeed be a new set temperature,

03:02:12  8  and that 28 CO parts per million corroborates with

03:02:17  9  this 375 degree test herein.  That is indeed

03:02:21 10  possible.  And he may not have noted it in his

03:02:24 11  notations.

03:02:24 12        Q.  Then on to September 22nd.  If you'll take

03:02:40 13  a look at the second page of his notes, he makes a

03:02:40 14  notation saying:

03:02:43 15                "Opening oven door greater

03:02:44 16            than 20 minute intervals

03:02:47 17            sometimes left ajar."

03:02:51 18            What do you understand that notation to

03:02:54 19  mean?

03:02:54 20        A.  I believe he's opening the door --

03:03:01 21  "greater than 20-minute intervals."  He must mean

03:03:06 22  he's leaving the door open for over 20 minutes,

03:03:10 23  sometimes left ajar.  I have -- I have -- I don't

03:03:16 24  understand what that word means.

03:03:18 25        Q.  Doesn't he testify that Albertsons advised


                                                                166










03:03:22  1  him that the oven door is typically opened once

03:03:27  2  every 20 minutes, in 20-minute intervals?

03:03:30  3        A.  In terms of placing product?

03:03:38  4        Q.  Correct.

03:03:38  5        A.  I don't know if he was informed that from

03:03:39  6  Albertsons.  I don't know that.

03:03:39  7        Q.  So you don't recall that from his

03:03:41  8  testimony?

03:03:41  9        A.  I do not.

03:03:42 10        Q.  That the average bake cycle is in the

03:03:45 11  neighborhood of 20 minutes?

03:03:48 12        A.  I thought it was 20 to 30 minutes, but

03:03:51 13  it's not a surprise hearing, so it's in that

03:03:53 14  vicinity.

03:03:53 15        Q.  Okay.  So in your view, the average bake

03:03:56 16  cycle is anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes?

03:03:58 17        A.  I believe that's what I understood,

03:04:00 18  reading the many depositions and testimonies.

03:04:02 19        Q.  Okay.  Do you recall any specific

03:04:04 20  depositions where the average bake cycle was within

03:04:07 21  20 to 30 minutes?

03:04:08 22        A.  It would definitely have to be -- fairly

03:04:13 23  confident it's in one of the bakery employees' quite

03:04:24 24  possibly.  Again, I don't have a definitive name in

03:04:27 25  mind, but I must have understood the typical bake


                                                                167










03:04:30  1  cycle being up to 30 minutes.  That was my

03:04:33  2  understanding.

03:04:34  3        Q.  Okay.  Here in Test 1 for September 22nd,

03:04:41  4  the first line says 292/400.

03:04:45  5            Do you know what that means?

03:04:58  6        A.  I don't know what that means.  I can only

03:04:59  7  hypothesize.

03:05:00  8        Q.  You have not seen any testimony that

03:05:00  9  explains those numbers?

03:05:03 10        A.  I don't recall.  Maybe there is, but I

03:05:05 11  don't recall his description of that.

03:05:06 12        Q.  Okay.  Now, Brignola testified that 400

03:05:09 13  degrees Fahrenheit is the setting of the oven and

03:05:15 14  that 292 was the measured temperature in the bake

03:05:17 15  chamber.

03:05:17 16            Does that sound about right?

03:05:20 17            MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  That may misstate

03:05:21 18  the testimony, calls for speculation, lacks

03:05:22 19  foundation.

03:05:23 20            THE WITNESS:  So that's quite possible.  I

03:05:29 21  don't know, but I don't recall that information in

03:05:30 22  his testimony.

03:05:31 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:05:31 24        Q.  And under the CO, he's got 40/46 PPM and

03:05:36 25  next to that there's a notation that says MEA/VG.


                                                                168










03:05:40  1            Do you know what that means?

03:05:41  2        A.  I understand that to mean MEA.  This is

03:05:48  3  referring to the 22nd -- the second day.  So the MEA

03:05:54  4  I believe is referring to Bertoch's detector,

03:05:57  5  because I believe he was working for MEA at the

03:06:00  6  time, and VG, that's his employer.  So he's

03:06:04  7  demarcating of one instrument from the other.

03:06:08  8        Q.  Okay.  So the 40 PPM is Bertoch's

03:06:11  9  measurement and the 46 PPM is Brignola's

03:06:16 10  measurement?

03:06:16 11        A.  For that specific line, it looks like it.

03:06:19 12        Q.  Okay.  And Bertoch is using what

03:06:20 13  instrument to make that measurement?

03:06:22 14        A.  He's using a TSI made air quality

03:06:26 15  detector.

03:06:27 16            MR. JARCHI:  Just for the record, his name

03:06:30 17  is Bertoch.

03:06:32 18            MR. TAYAB:  Bertoch.  Got it.

03:06:35 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:06:36 20        Q.  And the 46 PPM, that's measured by

03:06:42 21  Brignola in his Testo device?

03:06:44 22        A.  It looks like that's the case.

03:06:46 23        Q.  And is there any indication as to the

03:06:48 24  location of the two probes in the bake chamber for

03:06:52 25  that particular set of measurements?


                                                                169










03:06:58  1        A.  Based on these notes and what I have read

03:07:03  2  for this specific Test Number 1, I believe, if I

03:07:23  3  recall correctly, this -- no, it's not clear to me.

03:07:27  4        Q.  So you don't know one way or the other

03:07:30  5  where the probes were for those two data points?

03:07:34  6        A.  Not definitively.

03:07:36  7        Q.  Okay.  Now, if the bake chamber

03:07:43  8  temperature was 292, as noted here, is it your view

03:07:48  9  that the oven has reached an equilibrium state

03:07:55 10  before this measurement was taken?

03:07:57 11            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts.

03:07:59 12            THE WITNESS:  Actually, can I just correct

03:08:00 13  my previous answer?

03:08:01 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:08:02 15        Q.  Sure.  Go ahead.

03:08:02 16        A.  If this was indeed the first test of the

03:08:05 17  second day, we know from testimony from -- I know

03:08:15 18  it's from Bertoch that the MEA detector was placed

03:08:19 19  under the door.

03:08:22 20        Q.  And what are you looking at?

03:08:24 21        A.  I'm looking at my data set from Bertoch.

03:08:51 22            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 20 was

03:08:51 23            marked for identification by the

03:08:51 24            deposition reporter and is attached

03:08:51 25            hereto.)


                                                                170










03:08:51  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:08:52  2        Q.  Let me hand you what I've marked as

03:08:55  3  Exhibit 20.  Take a look at that document and

03:08:57  4  identify it for the record, please.

03:08:58  5        A.  Yes.  So this is a data set coming from

03:09:04  6  the TSI, Mr. Bertoch's detector, and it isn't the

03:09:10  7  raw data; however, it's the raw data superimposing

03:09:15  8  my notes and annotations and also determining the

03:09:21  9  COAF from an Excel spreadsheet.

03:09:27 10        Q.  So you received Bertoch's raw data and you

03:09:38 11  put it in an Excel spreadsheet and made certain

03:09:41 12  computations of your own on that data; is that fair?

03:09:44 13        A.  Correct.

03:09:45 14        Q.  And so you were using this document to

03:09:52 15  ascertain that the 40 PPM, the first Bertoch data

03:09:58 16  point from Test 1 on September 22nd was at a certain

03:10:08 17  location in the oven; correct?

03:10:09 18            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

03:10:10 19  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.

         20            THE WITNESS:  Sorry.  Could you repeat

         21  that question?  I was just looking at something

         22  else.

         23            (The record was read as follows:

         24            Q.   And so you were using this

         25            document to ascertain that the


                                                                171










          1            40 PPM, the first Bertoch data

          2            point from Test 1 on

          3            September 22nd was at a certain

          4            location in the oven; is that

          5            correct?)

03:10:33  6            THE WITNESS:  I was looking at it just a

03:10:35  7  few moments ago, as I thought I placed a notation

03:10:39  8  where the location was; however, that's incorrect,

03:10:42  9  and I'm actually just looking at Mr. Bertoch's hand

03:10:47 10  notes to try and figure out the location, and he

03:10:56 11  does note in his notes that it's on the floor.  And

03:11:03 12  I believe starting at -- in his handwritten notes,

03:11:06 13  227 has a temperature column, a carbon monoxide

03:11:13 14  column and then he has on floor.

03:11:17 15            So I'm presuming that that test is --

03:11:24 16  lines up with this period, and the first test is on

03:11:28 17  the floor.

03:11:28 18            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 21 was

03:11:28 19            marked for identification by the

03:11:28 20            deposition reporter and is attached

03:11:28 21            hereto.)

03:11:31 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:11:31 23        Q.  So you're looking at Exhibit 21; is that

03:11:34 24  correct, which are Bertoch's handwritten notes?

03:11:36 25        A.  Yes.


                                                                172










03:11:36  1        Q.  Okay.  And you're referring to Page 3 of

03:11:40  2  those notes?

03:11:40  3        A.  Correct.

03:11:42  4        Q.  And I apologize.  I didn't have that

03:11:47  5  document when you were telling me about the

03:11:49  6  location.

03:11:50  7            Can you tell me what it is on Page 3 that

03:11:52  8  leads you to believe that Bertoch's probe was on the

03:11:59  9  floor for the 40 PPM reading?

03:12:01 10        A.  I believe -- so regarding Brignola's

03:12:07 11  notes, on Page Number 2, Exhibit 19, Page 4, there

03:12:24 12  is an identifier calling it Test #1, Test 1, and it

03:12:34 13  seems to me that given the data set from Bertoch

03:12:43 14  coming from his meter and the time that he's noting

03:12:47 15  in his notes that it is on the floor.  So I'm

03:12:51 16  assuming, trying to map this together, that Test 1

03:12:55 17  is the same Test 1 that he's generating from his

03:12:59 18  digital data.

03:13:01 19        Q.  But it doesn't say anywhere on that page

03:13:04 20  that it is Test 1 on Exhibit 21, does it?

03:13:08 21            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

03:13:08 22  ambiguous.

03:13:13 23            THE WITNESS:  Per the data I have, it is

03:13:15 24  his Test 1 at that time around 2:00 p.m., 2:20-ish

03:13:22 25  or so.


                                                                173










03:13:24  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:13:24  2        Q.  So you're looking now at Exhibit 20.

03:13:29  3            So what is it about Exhibit 20 that leads

03:13:33  4  you to believe that Bertoch's first data point which

03:13:37  5  says 40 PPM, the probe was on the floor?

03:13:41  6        A.  So this is the start of the data sequence.

03:13:45  7        Q.  So Exhibit 20, the start of the data

03:13:48  8  sequence, is at 2:19 p.m.

03:13:50  9            Is that what you're pointing to?

03:13:52 10        A.  Yes.

03:13:52 11        Q.  Okay.

03:13:55 12        A.  And I understand that that is the start of

03:13:56 13  testing on the second day, and that refers me to

03:14:00 14  believe that this categorizes Test Number 1, and

03:14:04 15  that maps on to Brignola's Test Number 1 per his

03:14:10 16  notation on page number -- Page Number 4 of

03:14:24 17  Exhibit 19.

03:14:25 18        Q.  Okay.  I still don't understand what Page

03:14:33 19  Number 4 of Exhibit 19 says about it being on the

03:14:37 20  floor.

03:14:39 21        A.  Well, Test Number 1 is here.  We have

03:14:45 22  handwritten notes from Bertoch mentioning on the

03:14:57 23  floor, so I'm assuming the meters are on the floor,

03:15:02 24  starting on --

03:15:03 25        Q.  So this is all far from a model of clarity


                                                                174










03:15:06  1  here, so there's assumption upon assumption to get

03:15:09  2  to a location of where the sensor was.

03:15:14  3            Okay.  So do you know for a fact where the

03:15:16  4  sensor was located when the 40 PPM was measured?

03:15:20  5            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, compound.

03:15:23  6            THE WITNESS:  As I mentioned, I believe it

03:15:26  7  was on the floor.

03:15:27  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:15:27  9        Q.  Okay.  If it's on the floor, is it inside

03:15:29 10  the bake chamber on the floor or where on the floor?

03:15:34 11        A.  Per the description of Brignola, the probe

03:15:38 12  was placed under the door through, I believe, a slit

03:15:43 13  under the door probing the inside of the bake

03:15:47 14  chamber.

03:15:47 15        Q.  Okay.  And Brignola's data point in Test

03:15:58 16  Number 1, that would be the 46 PPM; is that right?

03:16:02 17        A.  Brignola.  It seems to be the case.

03:16:08 18        Q.  And the second data point for Test

03:16:11 19  Number 1 says 360/400, and there's a single data

03:16:16 20  point of 54.

03:16:21 21            What's your understanding as to what 360

03:16:24 22  denotes?

03:16:26 23        A.  Again, I think we mentioned it prior;

03:16:30 24  that -- I think you mentioned it.  It's set at 400

03:16:34 25  and the current temperature of the oven is 360


                                                                175










03:16:40  1  degrees as measured by some thermocouple somewhere.

03:16:44  2        Q.  Do you have any idea as to the time when

03:16:47  3  this data was taken?

03:16:50  4        A.  The time of this Test Number 1?

03:16:54  5        Q.  The time when the second data point was

03:16:57  6  measured under Test Number 1.

03:17:00  7        A.  No.  I don't have a time stamp here.

03:17:03  8        Q.  Do you have any idea of when the first

03:17:07  9  data point in Test Number 1 was taken?

03:17:11 10        A.  Again, I would presume that it was taken

03:17:16 11  sometime on the second day starting in the

03:17:20 12  afternoon, because we know they were both there, and

03:17:23 13  we have the data log coming from a TSI instrument

03:17:28 14  starting at around 2:19 p.m. on the 22nd of

03:17:34 15  September.

03:17:34 16        Q.  But you can't point on this data log on

03:17:38 17  Exhibit 20, which is your compilation of Bertoch's

03:17:43 18  data, you can't say which data point correlates to

03:17:46 19  that 40 PPM number?

03:17:51 20        A.  I don't have the time stamp to do that.

03:17:53 21        Q.  So you can't tell when it was taken?

03:17:55 22        A.  It's impossible with the information

03:18:00 23  provided here to do that.

03:18:01 24        Q.  Okay.  There is no way of telling at what

03:18:01 25  time that data was gathered for the first data


                                                                176










03:18:05  1  point?

03:18:05  2        A.  Again, based on these notes, based on all

03:18:06  3  the information I have, I cannot do that.

03:18:08  4        Q.  Okay.  And then there is no way to tell

03:18:12  5  after what point in time the second data point was

03:18:15  6  gathered, which has a number of 54 PPM; correct?

03:18:20  7        A.  Again, that information is lacking.

03:18:24  8        Q.  Okay.  And then do you know one way or the

03:18:26  9  other whether the 54 PPM was measured on the Q-Trak

03:18:31 10  or the Testo instrument?

03:18:35 11        A.  There is no notation of that.

03:18:37 12        Q.  So you don't know one way or the other or

03:18:41 13  one can't tell one way or the other where the 54 PPM

03:18:45 14  number came from?

03:18:46 15        A.  That's correct.  I don't know what

03:18:48 16  Mr. Brignola was noting, which instrument that was.

03:18:53 17        Q.  Okay.  Then after that there's a notation

03:18:55 18  saying open door; is that right?

03:18:56 19        A.  Yes.

03:18:57 20        Q.  And then there's a notation that says 376

03:19:00 21  degrees Fahrenheit, and then it says 0/0.

03:19:06 22            Do you know what that means?

03:19:09 23        A.  No, I do not.

03:19:15 24        Q.  Is it possible that when the door was

03:19:17 25  opened the measurement taken of the bake chamber was


                                                                177










03:19:20  1  376 and no carbon monoxide was detected on either

03:19:24  2  device?

03:19:25  3            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation, lacks

03:19:26  4  foundation, asked and answered.

03:19:30  5            THE WITNESS:  When the door was opened, I

03:19:32  6  do not know where the detectors were at that time,

03:19:35  7  what the detectors were sampling and how much after

03:19:38  8  that period after opening the door that that mark or

03:19:42  9  that stamp of carbon monoxide was noted.  I don't

03:19:46 10  have that information.  Again, just like previously,

03:19:49 11  we don't have the time stamp.

03:19:50 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:19:51 13        Q.  Okay.  But you can't tell whether the

03:19:53 14  instruments were in the bake chamber or outside the

03:19:56 15  bake chamber or when that door was opened and these

03:19:59 16  samples were taken?

03:20:01 17            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

03:20:02 18            THE WITNESS:  I cannot make that judgment

03:20:05 19  either way.

03:20:06 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:20:24 21        Q.  Okay.  Now, you are aware, are you not,

03:20:27 22  that before combustion readings are taken in a DRO2G

03:20:32 23  oven, the manufacturer says you need to run it for

03:20:36 24  at least two cycles before any combustion

03:20:41 25  measurements are taken?


                                                                178










03:20:42  1            MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, incomplete

03:20:44  2  hypothetical.

03:20:44  3            THE WITNESS:  I haven't read anywhere that

03:20:47  4  mentions that.

03:20:47  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:20:48  6        Q.  You have not seen that anywhere in the

03:20:50  7  instruction manuals or any of the manuals from ITW?

03:20:53  8        A.  I have not seen it.

03:20:54  9        Q.  You have not seen that.

03:20:56 10            And you're not aware that there have to be

03:20:59 11  two cycles before combustion measurements are taken?

03:21:02 12            MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, vague and

03:21:03 13  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, irrelevant.

03:21:04 14            THE WITNESS:  Again, I have not seen that

03:21:05 15  data.

03:21:05 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:21:06 17        Q.  Are you aware that the oven needs to be

03:21:09 18  run for at least ten minutes prior to any combustion

03:21:13 19  measurements being taken?

03:21:14 20            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

03:21:16 21  argumentative, vague and ambiguous, irrelevant.

03:21:18 22            THE WITNESS:  I haven't seen that

03:21:20 23  information anywhere in the material that I have.

03:21:22 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:21:23 25        Q.  Okay.  So in none of the material you


                                                                179










03:21:24  1  reviewed you came across the requirement that the

03:21:27  2  oven needs to run for ten minutes at least before a

03:21:32  3  combustion analysis is done?

03:21:33  4            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

03:21:34  5            THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  I have not

03:21:36  6  seen that requirement.

03:21:37  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:21:37  8        Q.  Okay.  Now, these measurements that were

03:21:39  9  taken, the Test 1 measurement that we've been

03:21:42 10  talking about, is this a combustion analysis, in

03:21:46 11  your mind?

03:21:47 12            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

03:21:50 13            THE WITNESS:  Is Test 1 a combustion

03:21:53 14  analysis?  Absolutely.

03:21:54 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:21:55 16        Q.  Okay.  Now, why do you say that?

03:21:58 17        A.  I say it because of the heat exchange

03:22:04 18  gorges that exist that allows the flue gases to

03:22:09 19  enter the bake chamber, so much so that we are

03:22:15 20  registering COAF and it's triggering the COAF motor

03:22:22 21  of the Testo detector.

03:22:23 22            So we have a depletion of oxygen, we have

03:22:27 23  an increase in carbon monoxide, which, by the

03:22:29 24  definition of the Testo detector and by many others,

03:22:33 25  including myself, is indeed considered a combustion


                                                                180










03:22:38  1  analysis at that point in time.

03:22:40  2        Q.  Okay.  Now, what's the oxygen level in

03:22:43  3  that reading in the Testo analyzer that you were

03:22:49  4  looking at?

03:22:57  5        A.  Yeah.  What exhibit is that that we

03:22:59  6  marked?

03:23:00  7        Q.  If you'll take a look at your declaration.

03:23:03  8  It's Exhibit 2 in your declaration -- actually, your

03:23:07  9  declaration is Exhibit 2.

03:23:22 10        A.  Okay.  I have it.

03:23:23 11        Q.  So the oxygen level is 18.8, isn't it?

03:23:27 12        A.  Correct.

03:23:28 13        Q.  Now, is that depleted oxygen?

03:23:31 14        A.  That is indeed depleted oxygen.  That's

03:23:34 15  deficient oxygen.

03:23:36 16        Q.  And what would be the expected value of

03:23:39 17  oxygen in a combustion sample?

03:23:42 18        A.  The theoretical oxygen level should be

03:23:46 19  zero.

03:23:50 20        Q.  If there is complete combustion, the level

03:23:51 21  of oxygen should be zero?

03:23:53 22        A.  That's correct.

03:23:53 23        Q.  Now, the DRO2G oven is designed to run

03:24:03 24  with an excess level of air; correct?

03:24:06 25            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.


                                                                181










03:24:07  1            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure.

03:24:08  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:24:08  3        Q.  Aren't all combustion devices supposed to

03:24:16  4  run with a level of air that is above stoichiometric

03:24:21  5  proportions necessary to maintain combustion?

03:24:26  6            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

03:24:29  7  incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.

03:24:30  8            THE WITNESS:  I have not read that in any

03:24:31  9  literature that I've reviewed in my life.

03:24:31 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:24:32 11        Q.  You're familiar with the Karg article;

03:24:37 12  right?

03:24:37 13        A.  Yes.

03:24:37 14        Q.  Okay.  Doesn't the Karg article talk about

03:24:40 15  that?

03:24:40 16        A.  Talk about what?

03:24:43 17        Q.  That there is normally excess air that is

03:24:47 18  applied in a combustion device?

03:24:49 19            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

03:24:51 20  incomplete hypothetical.

03:24:51 21            THE WITNESS:  But in this case you used

03:24:53 22  the word "normally"; previously, you used "in all

03:24:57 23  cases."

03:24:57 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:24:58 25        Q.  Sorry.  I was --


                                                                182










03:24:58  1        A.  So it's a different question.

03:25:00  2        Q.  -- imprecise.

03:25:02  3            In a combustion device, is it typical to

03:25:12  4  have air in excess of the stoichiometrically

03:25:18  5  required air to maintain perfect combustion; isn't

03:25:21  6  that correct?

03:25:21  7            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

03:25:22  8  incomplete hypothetical.

03:25:23  9            THE WITNESS:  It's not uncommon to have

03:25:26 10  that.

03:25:26 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:25:26 12        Q.  And in this DRO2G model oven, is

03:25:36 13  stoichiometric air used, or is it a level above

03:25:40 14  stoichiometric air?

03:25:41 15        A.  Based on all the data that I have seen,

03:25:44 16  it's definitely above and, hence, we have the large

03:25:46 17  amount of excess air and dilution of carbon

03:25:50 18  monoxide.

03:25:50 19        Q.  Okay.  Now, what's the effect of excess

03:26:01 20  air on the COAF level?

03:26:03 21            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

03:26:06 22  incomplete hypothetical.

03:26:07 23            THE WITNESS:  The excess air is a dilution

03:26:14 24  factor to the carbon monoxide air-free measurement

03:26:16 25  or calculation, so the more excess air one has in a


                                                                183










03:26:20  1  flue gas, one is further diluting the as-measured

03:26:25  2  carbon monoxide concentration that the petrochemical

03:26:31  3  sensor is detecting.

03:26:33  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:26:33  5        Q.  Okay.  Now, back to Brignola's declaration.

03:26:59  6            Looking at the second test that they ran

03:27:01  7  on September 22nd, if you look at Paragraph 4 of

03:27:13  8  Brignola's declaration, he says that:

03:27:16  9                "46 PPM was measured

03:27:18 10            inside the oven, with the oven

03:27:21 11            temperature control set to

03:27:22 12            400-degrees."

03:27:36 13        A.  Okay.

03:27:36 14        Q.  And then he says:

03:27:37 15                "The CO levels detected

03:27:41 16            varied between 11 and 54 PPM

03:27:42 17            emitting from, and inside the

03:27:45 18            baking compartment of the oven."

03:27:54 19        A.  Okay.

03:27:55 20        Q.  So do you see that anywhere in his notes?

03:28:01 21            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

03:28:04 22            THE WITNESS:  Could you clarify that,

03:28:06 23  please?  What were you meaning?

03:28:08 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:28:09 25        Q.  So he's talking about CO levels varied


                                                                184










03:28:14  1  between 11 and 54 PPM.

03:28:17  2            Now, do you see those numbers reflected in

03:28:24  3  Brignola's notes attached to the declaration?

03:28:27  4            MR. JARCHI:  Compound.

03:28:38  5            THE WITNESS:  I see Brignola's Test 2

03:28:41  6  notes.  I see he has MEA/VG under the line or the

03:28:54  7  row that is marked 4:26 and with a CO column 9/11.

03:29:08  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:29:08  9        Q.  And the 11 PPM number was generated by

03:29:13 10  Brignola?

03:29:14 11        A.  Correct.

03:29:16 12        Q.  All right.

03:29:17 13        A.  Again, if this represents the format the

03:29:21 14  VG equates to 11, then I would translate it as such,

03:29:26 15  correct.

03:29:26 16        Q.  Okay.  But the temperature indicated there

03:29:28 17  is 375 and not 400; is that right?

03:29:33 18            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and

03:29:45 19  ambiguous.

03:29:45 20            THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't read it as such,

03:29:48 21  given that it's a separate sentence and it stands

03:29:51 22  alone on Paragraph 4.  I would not qualify that

03:29:56 23  sentence at a set temperature of such.

03:30:01 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:30:02 25        Q.  Okay.  So the range that they're talking


                                                                185










03:30:04  1  about is a combination between results they got in

03:30:08  2  Test 1 and Test 2; is that right?

03:30:13  3        A.  Again --

03:30:15  4            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

03:30:19  5            THE WITNESS:  I think the way I'm reading

03:30:20  6  it as I sit here is Paragraph 4 in its entirety

03:30:26  7  during the inspection of the oven in September

03:30:28  8  2010 -- he's not really referring to a day or a

03:30:31  9  test -- and the last sentence of that paragraph, I

03:30:34 10  believe he's summarizing the span of carbon monoxide

03:30:40 11  as measured values he obtained.  That's the way I

03:30:45 12  interpret that.

03:30:45 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:30:46 14        Q.  Okay.  Now, under Test 2, it says:

03:30:50 15                "High temperature limit

03:30:51 16            tripped on Test 1."

03:30:53 17            What does that mean?

03:30:59 18        A.  Again, I don't know what it means, but

03:31:05 19  again, we have effectively an oven with a lot of

03:31:12 20  problems, and it seems not to be functioning

03:31:16 21  normally on various respects.

03:31:19 22            So, again, I don't know what that means,

03:31:22 23  you know, given his handwriting and his notation.  I

03:31:26 24  don't know what that means.

03:31:27 25        Q.  And then there's an entry that says:


                                                                186










03:31:52  1                "Error MEA gage not

03:31:55  2            temperature independent."

03:31:56  3            What is that?

03:32:01  4        A.  I'm not sure.  I believe he's referring to

03:32:04  5  the TSI, not temperature, and there is a temperature

03:32:11  6  recording on the TSI and I'm not sure.  Based on the

03:32:16  7  digital data that I have, it sort of maxes out at

03:32:23  8  140.  So I'm not sure if that is what he's referring

03:32:26  9  to.

03:32:27 10        Q.  Are you relying on any of the data that

03:33:10 11  Brignola has generated in rendering your opinions?

03:33:15 12        A.  Brignola.  Absolutely.

03:33:18 13        Q.  Now, you do not mention Brignola's data in

03:33:26 14  your declaration, do you?

03:33:28 15            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

03:33:34 16            THE WITNESS:  I believe I did mention this

03:33:38 17  data point in my declaration.

03:33:43 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:33:44 19        Q.  You mentioned that data point which is

03:33:47 20  25 PPM and 329 COAF, but you don't attribute that to

03:33:53 21  Brignola specifically in your declaration; right?

03:33:58 22        A.  It's hard for me to agree.  I don't know

03:34:00 23  what you mean by specify or --

03:34:01 24        Q.  I don't see the name Brignola in your

03:34:04 25  declaration.


                                                                187










03:34:05  1        A.  Oh.  That's a very good point.  At the

03:34:08  2  time I didn't know whose meter this was.  It was --

03:34:16  3  I think we were having some questions.  Was it

03:34:17  4  Mr. Gumbert's meter, was it Brignola's meter.  It

03:34:22  5  wasn't clear to me.  I didn't have that information

03:34:24  6  at hand to identify it as X, Y, Z.

03:34:27  7        Q.  But now after looking at the data that you

03:34:30  8  received, you are now a hundred percent positive

03:34:34  9  that that's a data point that Mr. Brignola took on

03:34:38 10  September 21st; is that correct?

03:34:39 11        A.  That's correct.

03:34:40 12        Q.  And how did you ascertain that?

03:34:44 13        A.  Through his testimony and through him

03:34:47 14  explaining he had the Testo device on the day of

03:34:52 15  inspection.

03:34:53 16        Q.  And his testimony specifically refers to

03:34:56 17  the set of data in Exhibit B of your declaration?

03:35:00 18        A.  His testimony specifically mentions the

03:35:03 19  Testo 330-2.

03:35:05 20        Q.  What device did Durazo have doing these --

03:35:12 21  doing the tests that were done on the 21st of

03:35:16 22  September?

03:35:17 23        A.  It's unclear.  He had a device.  I believe

03:35:19 24  he did not -- again, that's according to my

03:35:22 25  recollection reading, I think, the recent --


                                                                188










03:35:27  1  Mr. Brignola's and Mr. Bertoch's testimony.  I

03:35:31  2  believe they arrived with -- that's what I recall.

03:35:35  3  I believe that's the case.

03:35:37  4        Q.  That they arrived with --

03:35:38  5        A.  They did not have an analyzer or detector.

03:35:42  6        Q.  Who's "they"?

03:35:43  7        A.  The folks that you just mentioned.

03:35:45  8        Q.  That neither Durazo nor Gumbert had an

03:35:50  9  analyzer?

03:35:50 10        A.  Correct.  That's my understanding.

03:35:52 11        Q.  Your understanding of the testimony is

03:35:53 12  that the only people who had carbon monoxide

03:35:56 13  measuring devices were Bertoch and Brignola?

03:36:00 14        A.  That's correct.

03:36:01 15        Q.  And Brignola brought the Testo and the

03:36:05 16  Bacharach device and Bertoch brought the Q-Trak

03:36:09 17  device?

03:36:10 18        A.  That's correct.

03:36:11 19        Q.  And the 25M PPM and 239 PPM COAF is the

03:36:21 20  Brignola data that you're relying on in your

03:36:23 21  declaration?

03:36:24 22        A.  That's correct.

03:36:24 23        Q.  Okay.  And that data was generated on

03:36:28 24  September 21st, is your opinion?

03:36:30 25        A.  That, I believe, is fairly certain, based


                                                                189










03:36:35  1  on his testimony.  And also we have another data set

03:36:41  2  that he produced from the second day of testing that

03:36:44  3  also we received higher COAF measurements, so...

03:36:52  4        Q.  Let's go to that.  That's Exhibit 13.

03:37:04  5            Now, I confess I've never seen this before

03:37:07  6  so we'll have to do it live here, and I need your

03:37:10  7  help knowing what you understand this data set to

03:37:15  8  mean to you.

03:37:22  9            So there are ten data points in this

03:37:24 10  spreadsheet; correct?

03:37:28 11        A.  That's correct.

03:37:31 12        Q.  And these were data points generated by

03:37:35 13  Brignola?

03:37:35 14        A.  That's correct.

03:37:36 15        Q.  And the dates here say September 22nd and

03:37:42 16  September 23rd.

03:37:43 17            Are those dates wrong?

03:37:44 18        A.  I believe so.  I believe he had a problem

03:37:46 19  with the time of this meter and I think that was

03:37:51 20  discussed in his testimony.  So, yes.

03:37:55 21        Q.  So I'll need to shift the data by a day or

03:38:00 22  a day and a half?

03:38:01 23        A.  The way I understand this is that this

03:38:04 24  data, the time stamp is running a little fast.  For

03:38:08 25  example, if we see -- okay.  Let's take -- let's


                                                                190










03:38:15  1  see.  Okay.  Let's take the Exhibit 13.  We have

03:38:24  2  10:33 p.m.

03:38:26  3        Q.  Before we get to that, you said his timer

03:38:29  4  was running a little fast.

03:38:31  5            Are you saying the internal clock on that

03:38:34  6  device is faulty?

03:38:37  7        A.  No, I'm not saying it's faulty; I'm saying

03:38:40  8  it hasn't been set for the local time of where the

03:38:43  9  instrument is actually located.

03:38:45 10        Q.  Do you know if that instrument was

03:38:47 11  calibrated?

03:38:49 12            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

03:38:50 13            MR. TAYAB:  I think I've asked this.

03:38:52 14            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

03:38:52 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:38:53 16        Q.  You said that Brignola leaves it to his

03:38:57 17  crew to take care of and that he doesn't worry about

03:39:00 18  those things.

03:39:00 19            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

03:39:02 20            THE WITNESS:  What I said was, again, from

03:39:04 21  his testimony, that he believed it was calibrated

03:39:07 22  and that VG takes care of those items.

03:39:11 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:39:12 24        Q.  Okay.  Now, let me try to understand what

03:39:15 25  these column headings are.


                                                                191










03:39:17  1            Do you have an understanding as to what

03:39:19  2  these column headings are?

03:39:23  3        A.  I believe most of them, yes.  I believe

03:39:33  4  most of them.

03:39:34  5        Q.  Well, can you tell me what the second

03:39:36  6  column heading is?

03:39:37  7        A.  Sure.  That's cut off, so that's probably

03:39:41  8  the only one that I'm not familiar with.  Set, Run,

03:39:44  9  Tim.  It's missing an "e," possibly, but again, I

03:39:48 10  can't speculate because there's no other word after

03:39:52 11  that.

03:39:52 12        Q.  Could it mean second run time?

03:39:54 13        A.  It could, but I don't know what the

03:39:56 14  definition of that is.

03:39:57 15        Q.  Okay.  Well, what about the next column?

03:40:01 16        A.  That is Tstack, which represents

03:40:07 17  temperature of the stack; that is, of the actual

03:40:09 18  measured gas coming from the thermocouple at the end

03:40:12 19  of the probe of the Testo.

03:40:16 20        Q.  So this is the temperature probe of the

03:40:18 21  Testo measuring the temperature of the gas that it's

03:40:21 22  measuring?

03:40:22 23        A.  Or its environment, correct.

03:40:25 24        Q.  Okay.  And then percentage Co2.  That's

03:40:30 25  obvious.


                                                                192










03:40:31  1        A.  Yes.

03:40:32  2        Q.  And then the next one is percentage EFF.

03:40:38  3            Do you know what that means?

03:40:38  4        A.  Yes.  The objective of most combustion

03:40:43  5  analyzers is to determine the efficiency of

03:40:51  6  a furnace, so the user places various parameters

03:40:55  7  within that, and the calculation of percent

03:40:56  8  efficiency is given to the user.  So that is what

03:40:58  9  it's logging, based on the input parameters, which

03:41:01 10  is temperature, carbon monoxide, COAF and oxygen.

03:41:07 11        Q.  Now, the next column, percentage ExAir.

03:41:10 12            What's that?

03:41:11 13        A.  That is the excess air column.

03:41:14 14        Q.  Okay.  And the next one is percentage of

03:41:17 15  oxygen?

03:41:18 16        A.  Correct.

03:41:19 17        Q.  The next one is carbon monoxide ambient?

03:41:24 18        A.  That's carbon monoxide as measured.

03:41:26 19        Q.  As measured.

03:41:27 20        A.  That's correct.  That's coming -- that's

03:41:29 21  the raw carbon monoxide value coming from a CO

03:41:35 22  sensor.

03:41:35 23        Q.  And then the next one is the air-fee

03:41:40 24  carbon monoxide, which is a calculated number;

03:41:43 25  correct?


                                                                193










03:41:43  1        A.  Yes.  That is calculated based on the CO

03:41:47  2  and the o2 sensor, which provides the air-free,

03:41:54  3  undiluted measurement of the carbon monoxide, which

03:41:57  4  is the absolute carbon monoxide that is in the

03:42:01  5  sample of the gas.

03:42:05  6        Q.  Okay.  Now, how do you know if the COAF is

03:42:09  7  computed using CO and o2 and not CO and Co2?

03:42:14  8        A.  So the way I understand the Testo runs and

03:42:18  9  operates is that it undertakes a calculation to

03:42:22 10  determine the Co2.  It's inferring a Co2 based on

03:42:27 11  some assumptions the meter has set up to undertake.

03:42:30 12        Q.  Okay.  So the Co2 percentage is also a

03:42:34 13  calculated number, is what you're saying?

03:42:36 14        A.  I believe so.  I believe so.  That occurs

03:42:40 15  in a number of combustion analyzers, and I believe

03:42:43 16  that is what is occurring with the Testo.

03:42:46 17        Q.  Okay.  Now, are any of the columns after

03:42:50 18  that relevant to our discussion?

03:42:52 19            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, vague and

03:42:52 20  ambiguous.

03:42:54 21            THE WITNESS:  Well, I can tell you what

03:42:56 22  they are.

03:42:56 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:42:56 24        Q.  Okay.  Go ahead.

03:43:01 25        A.  It's T ambient, which is the ambient


                                                                194










03:43:01  1  temperature as measured -- again, I haven't read

03:43:05  2  the manual fully, but I'm assuming it is of the

03:43:08  3  environment where the analyzer is placed, the

03:43:10  4  handheld part of the analyzer.  And the instrument

03:43:12  5  is of the internals of the analyzer itself to ensure

03:43:18  6  that it's not overheating as we are placing --

03:43:22  7  sucking hot air from a certain location.

03:43:36  8        Q.  Okay.

03:43:36  9        A.  Again, that's the way I interpret this,

03:43:37 10  and there may be a mistake here or there, but in the

03:43:42 11  whole, I believe that that is correct.

03:43:42 12        Q.  Okay.  Now, let's talk about each of these

03:43:47 13  ten data points.

03:43:51 14            Do you have an understanding as to where

03:43:54 15  these ten data points were taken from?

03:43:58 16        A.  I believe -- okay.  So I believe I would

03:44:02 17  look at this in two -- two steps.

03:44:07 18            One is the 10:33 time stamp, which is the

03:44:12 19  first row to the third row, which is 10:42.  That's

03:44:20 20  about nine minutes.  And I'm understanding that to

03:44:23 21  be the first test of the day starting up the oven

03:44:28 22  from a cold state, and as we discussed a moment ago

03:44:35 23  that both of these are probing under the door.

03:44:39 24  That's the way I'm interpreting these data in these

03:44:45 25  tests.


                                                                195










03:44:45  1        Q.  And what makes you believe that it's the

03:44:48  2  oven in the cold state?

03:44:53  3        A.  Well, first of all, the temperature draw

03:45:00  4  in at the bottom of the door is fairly low, so one

03:45:04  5  could infer at that point in time it's close to

03:45:08  6  ambient, and I believe there is some notes -- let me

03:45:16  7  just have a quick look here -- and that it's the

03:46:02  8  first log of the data sequence.

03:46:06  9        Q.  Now, are you relying on any of these three

03:46:13 10  data points for your opinions?

03:46:15 11        A.  As it currently stands, it actually

03:46:24 12  further enhances my opinions, especially the third

03:46:28 13  row where we see a COAF measured up to 249, which is

03:46:37 14  actually higher than we had from the previous day.

03:46:46 15        Q.  And you are relying on that number?

03:46:49 16        A.  I'm relying on the whole data set,

03:46:51 17  everything we have here.

03:46:55 18        Q.  Now, do you consider the first three data

03:46:58 19  points to be valid data points?

03:47:02 20        A.  I have no reason not to.

03:47:04 21        Q.  You testified that the first three data

03:47:11 22  points represents a cold state of the oven.

03:47:14 23            Is it appropriate to be taking

03:47:16 24  measurements when the oven is in its cold state?

03:47:20 25        A.  Well, the oven is emitting carbon


                                                                196










03:47:24  1  monoxide.  The oven is depleting oxygen.  The oven

03:47:28  2  is increasing in temperature.

03:47:32  3            So the burner is functioning.  It's

03:47:34  4  reading flue gases in the bake chamber, which

03:47:38  5  confirms the heat exchanger at this point is being

03:47:42  6  breached.

03:47:43  7            And we have three time stamps and data

03:47:47  8  points of -- and we see an increase in COAF.  So

03:47:56  9  that's how I interpret these three data points.

03:48:01 10        Q.  Now, the third data point, this seems to

03:48:08 11  be a large excess of air and a very large amount of

03:48:12 12  carbon -- I mean a large amount of oxygen, but very

03:48:15 13  low carbon dioxide.

03:48:18 14            Do you have any explanation for that?

03:48:26 15        A.  Explanation for what exactly, the COAF

03:48:30 16  value or --

03:48:31 17        Q.  Yes.

03:48:31 18        A.  The COAF is calculated.  We have excess

03:48:36 19  here that's diluting the carbon monoxide, so to

03:48:39 20  compensate for that, you have to compensate for the

03:48:43 21  large excess air.  Per the equation, the COAF has

03:48:47 22  increased.

03:48:47 23            And that's interesting because the

03:48:49 24  temperature is increasing, and as we could see,

03:48:54 25  there is no -- given the time stamps that we're


                                                                197










03:48:59  1  seeing, it's two minutes and then seven minutes, so

03:49:02  2  we're having data being recorded at not even

03:49:07  3  intervals, so we're seeing the oven operating --

03:49:11  4  again, the features are increasing in temperature

03:49:14  5  and increasing in carbon monoxide air-free.

03:49:17  6        Q.  Now, did Brignola take these measurements

03:49:22  7  at randomly-selected points in time?

03:49:25  8        A.  It seems to be the case.

03:49:27  9        Q.  So it's not log-in data; he's just taking

03:49:32 10  random data points?

03:49:33 11        A.  It seems to be the case.

03:49:34 12        Q.  So he seems to be taking manual data

03:49:37 13  points in this data set?

03:49:39 14        A.  I believe so.

03:49:40 15        Q.  And do we have any idea at what point in

03:49:48 16  the basic cycle he's taking these data points?

03:49:51 17            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

03:50:00 18            THE WITNESS:  I believe, looking at the

03:50:03 19  first three points, it must be during the burner on,

03:50:09 20  given that the temperature is increasing.  So that's

03:50:13 21  my inference from looking at the data.

03:50:15 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:50:16 23        Q.  Okay.  But there's a seven-minute gap

03:50:20 24  between 2 and 3, isn't there?

03:50:22 25            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.


                                                                198










03:50:32  1            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure what you're

03:50:33  2  referring to.

03:50:34  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:50:34  4        Q.  The burner could have come on several

03:50:37  5  times, isn't it?

03:50:39  6            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

03:50:40  7  testimony --

03:50:41  8            THE WITNESS:  I don't know that.  I don't

03:50:41  9  know that information one way or the other.

03:50:41 10            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

03:50:42 11  testimony.

03:50:42 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

03:50:43 13        Q.  Now, with respect to Data Points 1, 2 and

03:50:46 14  3, do you know where the probe was when that data

03:50:49 15  was captured?

03:50:49 16        A.  I believe, given the notations, that the

03:50:55 17  data points for 1, 2 and 3 was captured with the

03:50:59 18  probe under the door.

03:50:59 19        Q.  Is that what Brignola testified to?

03:51:02 20        A.  I didn't see that information.

03:51:04 21        Q.  So you don't know whether Brignola

03:51:06 22  testified to that or not?

03:51:07 23        A.  At this point in time, I don't recall.  I

03:51:10 24  don't recall.

03:51:10 25        Q.  And what device was this data taken on?


                                                                199










03:51:22  1        A.  Can you repeat the question, please?

03:51:24  2        Q.  Was it on the Testo device that this data

03:51:27  3  was recorded?

03:51:27  4        A.  I believe it was.

03:51:29  5        Q.  Okay.  And then what about Data Points 4

03:51:35  6  to 10.

03:51:36  7            Where was the probe when those data points

03:51:39  8  were taken?

03:51:40  9        A.  I know sometime, by reading the testimony

03:51:58 10  that on the second day, the probe was placed through

03:52:02 11  the door, so I would have to -- let me just double

03:52:09 12  check Burtoch's notes.

03:52:19 13            I would have to assume that sometime

03:52:22 14  afterwards, which is 90 minutes or so, which would

03:52:29 15  give them enough time to drill a hole and place

03:52:32 16  their equipment and set it up again, that -- that

03:52:36 17  the probe was placed through the door.  I know it

03:52:39 18  occurred.  I saw pictures of it.  So I believe that

03:52:47 19  could be the case.

03:52:48 20        Q.  Now, are Data Points 4 to 10 taken on the

03:52:51 21  22nd or the 21st?

03:52:53 22        A.  Well, it's a continuation of the previous

03:52:57 23  three data points about, you know, less than two

03:53:02 24  hours later, because we're passing 22nd to the 23rd,

03:53:07 25  passing midnight and coming into, based on his


                                                                200










03:53:09  1  timestamp, the next day morning, which is

03:53:12  2  effectively 22nd afternoon, two hours afterwards.

03:53:16  3        Q.  So all of these data points are taken on

03:53:19  4  the 22nd --

03:53:20  5        A.  Correct.

03:53:21  6        Q.  -- of September?

03:53:22  7        A.  Correct.  Again, that's the way I'm

03:53:24  8  interpreting it, and per my understanding of when

03:53:29  9  Mr. Brignola was there, actually there.

03:53:31 10        Q.  So the last set of data points were taken

03:53:36 11  with the probe, the Testo probe stuck through a hole

03:53:42 12  that's drilled through the door; is that correct?

03:53:45 13        A.  I believe that's what occurred.

03:53:47 14        Q.  Okay.  And what observations have you made

03:53:50 15  with respect to Data Points 4 through 10?

03:53:53 16        A.  Well, again, these are taken at not even

03:54:04 17  intervals.  We see a range of COAF measurements

03:54:14 18  taken, and it seems that during some point the door

03:54:25 19  may have been open.

03:54:29 20        Q.  And that would be air .8?

03:54:34 21        A.  Correct.  That's possible.  That's

03:54:36 22  possible.

03:54:36 23        Q.  And are you using any of these data points

03:54:43 24  for your -- as a basis for your opinions?

03:54:48 25        A.  The -- which data points, the --


                                                                201










03:54:50  1        Q.  4 through 10.

03:54:51  2        A.  4 through 10?  Again, specifically picking

03:54:55  3  one and using it?  Not necessarily, but I'm using

03:54:58  4  the entire data set to support my declaration

03:55:03  5  opinions that have been presented.

03:55:04  6        Q.  Are any of these data points, any of these

03:55:11  7  ten data points invalid?

03:55:14  8        A.  I've seen no information to believe

03:55:17  9  they're invalid.

03:55:18 10        Q.  So you're taking all ten data points to be

03:55:21 11  valid data points?

03:55:22 12        A.  Again, I haven't seen any information for

03:55:26 13  me not to take any data from this set as invalid.

03:55:31 14        Q.  Okay.  And do you know what the oven

03:55:33 15  temperature was set at for these data points?

03:55:45 16        A.  No, I don't, but I would have to assume

03:55:50 17  it's at least equal, if not greater than that

03:55:53 18  measured from the probe.

03:55:54 19        Q.  Which is the temperatures under the column

03:56:01 20  titled F, degrees F, Tstack?

03:56:07 21        A.  Correct.

03:56:08 22        Q.  But you don't know one way or the other

03:56:10 23  what the set temperature of the oven was?

03:56:14 24            MR. JARCHI:  Vague, compound.

03:56:15 25            THE WITNESS:  All I have from Mr. Brignola


                                                                202










03:56:18  1  is his testimony, again, which he may have mentioned

03:56:21  2  it in his deposition, and I note in his declaration

03:56:26  3  just a minute ago, we looked at that, and he

03:56:29  4  mentioned that he set it at a few different values.

03:56:33  5  That's basically what I have.

03:56:49  6            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  All right.  Let's go

03:56:50  7  off the record for a second.

03:56:51  8            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.

03:56:53  9  The time is 3:56 p.m.

03:56:53 10            (Whereupon, a recess was held

04:08:38 11            from 3:56 p.m. to 4:08 p.m.)

04:08:38 12            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the

04:08:40 13  record.  The time is 4:08 p.m.

04:08:44 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:08:44 15        Q.  Welcome back, Doctor.  I have a few more

04:08:49 16  questions before finishing off with Brignola.

04:08:56 17            MS. FREDERICK:  Hi, are you guys starting?

04:08:59 18  Am I reconnected?

04:08:59 19            MR. JARCHI:  Yes.  How do you know that?

04:09:07 20  Yes, we just started.

04:09:09 21            MS. FREDERICK:  Thank you.

04:09:09 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:09:09 23        Q.  During the testing that Brignola performed

04:09:11 24  on September 21st and 22nd, he wore a personal 4 gas

04:09:16 25  monitor, did he not?


                                                                203










04:09:17  1        A.  I did not see a 4 gas monitor.

04:09:20  2        Q.  Did you not see that in his testimony,

04:09:23  3  that he was wearing a 4 gas monitor?

04:09:33  4        A.  I'd love to see where he mentions 4 gas.

04:09:34  5        Q.  Okay.  Do you know that he was -- did you

04:09:34  6  see from his testimony that he was wearing any sort

04:09:35  7  of monitor?

04:09:35  8        A.  I believe he was wearing a single gas

04:09:39  9  carbon monoxide UEI detector.

04:09:41 10        Q.  And what's a single gas UEI detector?

04:09:51 11        A.  It measures one gas, single gas, and I

04:09:52 12  believe his detector was a carbon monoxide detector.

04:09:55 13        Q.  Okay.  And in what manner does it detect

04:09:58 14  carbon monoxide?  Does it detect it in different

04:10:00 15  levels, or how does it work?

04:10:02 16        A.  The UEI detector detects -- is designed to

04:10:08 17  detect ambient carbon monoxide concentration, and it

04:10:12 18  works via an electrochemical sensor cell, and the

04:10:18 19  carbon monoxide concentration, once detected,

04:10:23 20  increases the upper voltage of the electrochemical

04:10:27 21  cell that is read and converted to a CO

04:10:30 22  concentration.

04:10:31 23        Q.  Now, does this detector have any lights on

04:10:43 24  it that warn the wearer?

04:10:43 25        A.  The UEI detector has a LED light at the


                                                                204










04:10:47  1  top that flashes when it's alarming, and the audible

04:10:54  2  buzzer part also is enabled above 35 parts per

04:11:00  3  minute.

04:11:01  4        Q.  Okay.  So the audio warning goes off at

04:11:04  5  any level above 35 parts per million --

04:11:07  6        A.  That's correct.

04:11:08  7        Q.  -- ambient CO?

04:11:11  8        A.  That's correct.

04:11:11  9        Q.  Okay.  Now, is there a green light on that

04:11:14 10  detector that goes off between 2 and 9 parts per

04:11:18 11  million?

04:11:19 12        A.  I believe so.

04:11:19 13        Q.  Okay.  Is there an amber light that goes

04:11:23 14  off between 10 and 34 PPM?

04:11:26 15        A.  Yes, I believe so.

04:11:27 16        Q.  And then there's a red light that goes off

04:11:31 17  at or above 35 PPM in addition to the aural alarm?

04:11:34 18        A.  I believe you are correct.

04:11:36 19        Q.  Okay.  Now, do you recall that Brignola

04:11:38 20  testified about whether or not that detector going

04:11:40 21  off during anytime during his testing on September 21st or

04:11:46 22  September 22nd?

04:11:46 23        A.  I do not recall where that detector was,

04:11:53 24  where it was located or whether it went off or not.

04:11:56 25        Q.  I believe you testified that the detector


                                                                205










04:11:58  1  was located either on his person or very close to

04:12:00  2  him.

04:12:00  3        A.  I did not read it -- or I did not see

04:12:03  4  that.  I'd love to see it.

04:12:06  5        Q.  Okay.  But you don't know one way or the

04:12:09  6  other whether he was wearing the detector, or even

04:12:12  7  if he was, where it was?

04:12:13  8        A.  I know from reading his testimony, I am

04:12:16  9  very certain that he did not mention he was wearing

04:12:20 10  it.  I didn't see that description at all.

04:12:25 11        Q.  Okay.  But did he have a UEI type detector

04:12:29 12  at the location while he was doing the test near the

04:12:34 13  oven?

04:12:34 14        A.  I believe he testified to that.

04:12:36 15        Q.  Okay.  And did that detector go off at any

04:12:42 16  point on the 21st or 22nd?

04:12:45 17            MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation.

04:12:45 18            THE WITNESS:  Again, I believe his

04:12:47 19  testimony was he doesn't recall if it went off or

04:12:51 20  not.  And again, I don't know where that was

04:12:54 21  located.

04:12:55 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:12:55 23        Q.  Now, does this detector work differently

04:12:58 24  from a carbon monoxide alarm?

04:13:01 25            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.


                                                                206










04:13:04  1            THE WITNESS:  In the abstract, it's not

04:13:06  2  much different.

04:13:07  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:13:07  4        Q.  Is this detector tied to a particular

04:13:16  5  carboxy hemoglobin level?

04:13:16  6        A.  This detector, meaning the UEI detector

04:13:19  7  or --

04:13:19  8        Q.  The UEI detector.  I'm sorry.

04:13:22  9        A.  The UEI detector, again, as you

04:13:25 10  summarized, has a certain algorithm where it is

04:13:27 11  alarming, and it is -- cutting a long story short,

04:13:33 12  it does not follow the UL 2034 protocol.

04:13:37 13        Q.  So if it senses, say, 35 parts per

04:13:42 14  million, it will immediately or within a short

04:13:44 15  period of time begin the audio warning?

04:13:48 16        A.  That's the way I understand its operation.

04:13:51 17        Q.  Okay.  Now, when you were at the

04:13:54 18  Albertsons during your inspection, was the CO alarm

04:13:58 19  still connected in the bakery?

04:14:01 20        A.  I don't recall it was even there.  I don't

04:14:08 21  recall seeing a CO detector.

04:14:10 22        Q.  Okay.  So did you check for one?

04:14:12 23        A.  I didn't specifically go there searching

04:14:15 24  for a CO detector, but if I saw one, I'm sure I

04:14:18 25  would have noted it or taken some pictures.


                                                                207










04:14:21  1        Q.  Now, was the CO detector that was at the

04:14:25  2  Albertsons in 2010, was that connected, to your

04:14:33  3  knowledge, when the September 21st and 22nd

04:14:37  4  experiments were done?

04:14:42  5        A.  From my reading of the testimonies, a lot

04:14:47  6  of inconsistencies exist, if there was one detector

04:14:54  7  or two detectors, and what periods of time the

04:14:59  8  second detector arrived if it even arrived.  So

04:15:03  9  again, I can't answer that because I don't have

04:15:06 10  definitive testimony, and a lot of it is not

04:15:11 11  consistent.

04:15:11 12        Q.  So your view is that the various different

04:15:14 13  witnesses who have testified have not testified

04:15:16 14  consistently as to the presence of one, two or

04:15:21 15  whatever the number was of the detectors at the

04:15:24 16  Albertsons in 2010; is that your view?

04:15:28 17        A.  Well, the most definitive and clearest

04:15:33 18  picture I have read regarding the CO detector

04:15:38 19  present at Albertsons bakery is the testimony from

04:15:45 20  Julie Lee.  She is the bakery manager.  And reading

04:15:50 21  her testimony, one paints the most detailed picture

04:15:56 22  of when, where it was located, et cetera.  And so

04:16:05 23  the first detector, my understanding, was located in

04:16:11 24  the bakery January, February sometime.

04:16:14 25        Q.  Of what year?


                                                                208










04:16:16  1        A.  2009.  It alarmed when the -- first

04:16:23  2  alarmed when the door was opened.  It was placed

04:16:30  3  next to what she describes as a baker's table

04:16:34  4  adjacent to the oven, again, during battery

04:16:38  5  operation.

04:16:40  6            I also read her testimony describing that

04:16:43  7  they moved it opposite the oven.  I'm not sure if

04:16:49  8  she used that descriptor, but it was somewhat

04:16:53  9  opposite the oven plugged into a wall plug cord, I

04:16:58 10  believe, and it also alarmed.  So it alarmed both in

04:17:03 11  a barely state and in its wall plug state.

04:17:08 12        Q.  I appreciate that, but my question was:

04:17:10 13  When the tests were done on September 21st and 22nd,

04:17:15 14  do you have any sense of whether or not a carbon

04:17:21 15  monoxide detector was connected at the bakery?

04:17:25 16        A.  No, I don't.

04:17:27 17            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

04:17:30 18  ambiguous.

04:17:30 19            THE WITNESS:  I haven't read definitive

04:17:34 20  testimony that has a CO detector during the

04:17:38 21  September 21st and 22nd, 2010 testing.

04:17:44 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:17:44 23        Q.  So you have not seen any testimony that

04:17:47 24  suggests whether or not there was a detector

04:17:50 25  connected at the bakery on September 21st or 22nd?


                                                                209










04:17:54  1        A.  I have not seen testimony from the

04:18:05  2  plaintiffs mentioning that.  I think there was some

04:18:08  3  speculation from somebody, and I don't want to

04:18:11  4  misstate who that was -- I believe it may have been

04:18:16  5  Mr. Byrd, that there may have been -- again, I would

04:18:20  6  have to reread his testimony to confirm that, but

04:18:25  7  again, the testimony that I have read seemed fairly

04:18:28  8  inconsistent and fuzzy.

04:18:31  9        Q.  So one way or the other, you don't know if

04:18:34 10  there was an alarm connected in the bakery when the

04:18:38 11  21st of September and 22nd of September tests were

04:18:43 12  conducted?

04:18:43 13        A.  That's correct.  I wasn't there to confirm

04:18:46 14  or deny.

04:18:47 15        Q.  Okay.  And so you don't know one way or

04:18:49 16  the other as to whether any alarm went off when the

04:18:52 17  testing was being done on the 21st or 22nd of

04:18:55 18  September?

04:18:55 19        A.  I believe that was a question to

04:18:59 20  Mr. Bertoch and Mr. Brignola, and I also recall them

04:19:10 21  mentioning that they do not recall if an alarm went

04:19:10 22  off.

04:19:10 23        Q.  Okay.  If an alarm went off or not?

04:19:11 24        A.  I don't know.  Again, all I remember is I

04:19:15 25  think they were asked that specifically and they did


                                                                210










04:19:18  1  not recall.

04:19:18  2        Q.  All right.  Let's move on to the testing

04:19:21  3  that Mr. Bertoch did.

04:19:26  4            Do you recall what sensor Mr. Bertoch

04:19:31  5  used?

04:19:31  6        A.  It's a TSI detector.

04:19:40  7        Q.  Now, what kind of a detector is a TSI

04:19:44  8  detector?

04:19:46  9        A.  It is an air quality detector that

04:19:52 10  measures carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and

04:19:58 11  also records, I believe, temperature and relative

04:20:03 12  humidity.

04:20:03 13        Q.  And what's an indoor air quality monitor

04:20:08 14  used for?

04:20:08 15        A.  That device is specifically designed to be

04:20:12 16  used as an indoor air quality detector so if one is

04:20:18 17  concerned about the indoor environment or ambient

04:20:22 18  location, they can obtain some data points regarding

04:20:26 19  air quality with it.

04:20:52 20            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 22 was

04:20:52 21            marked for identification by the

04:20:52 22            deposition reporter and is attached

04:20:52 23            hereto.)

04:20:53 25        Q.  Let me hand you what's marked as


                                                                211










04:20:55  1  Exhibit 22.  Take a moment to look at that document,

04:20:59  2  and then let me know -- please identify that

04:21:04  3  document for the record.

04:21:08  4        A.  Okay.  This is Exhibit Number 22, Model

04:21:14  5  8552/8554 Q-Trak Plus IAQ Monitor manufactured by

04:21:24  6  TSI.

04:21:24  7        Q.  So was the Q-Trak Model 8554 detector the

04:21:37  8  one that Bertoch used in his presentation?

04:21:38  9        A.  Off the top of my head, it was one of

04:21:39 10  them.  It was a variety of these series.

04:21:41 11        Q.  Okay.  And have you seen this manual

04:21:46 12  before?

04:21:46 13        A.  I believe I have.

04:21:47 14        Q.  Have you had an opportunity to review it?

04:21:49 15        A.  I believe I have seen it.  I believe I

04:21:53 16  have reviewed it.

04:21:53 17        Q.  Okay.  If you'll turn to Page 9, it says

04:22:04 18  that the 8552 measures only Co2 and not CO; is that

04:22:14 19  right?  It's the 8554 model that measures CO; is

04:22:20 20  that correct?

04:22:20 21            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

04:22:21 22  ambiguous, form.

04:22:22 23            THE WITNESS:  As it's written, yes.

04:22:24 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:22:24 25        Q.  Okay.  Is it likely that Mr. Bertoch used


                                                                212










04:22:27  1  the 8554 model?

04:22:28  2        A.  That would be the case if this is correct,

04:22:30  3  yes.

04:22:31  4        Q.  And it says here that there are three

04:22:34  5  modes under which data can be captured; is that

04:22:37  6  correct?

04:22:37  7        A.  Yes, that seems correct.

04:22:52  8        Q.  So one is a survey mode, and the -- is

04:22:59  9  that right?

04:22:59 10        A.  Survey mode, yes.

04:23:00 11        Q.  And then the other one is a sample mode?

04:23:03 12        A.  Yes.

04:23:04 13        Q.  And the last one is the data log mode; is

04:23:10 14  that right?

04:23:10 15        A.  That looks correct, yes.

04:23:12 16        Q.  Now, is there a difference between the

04:23:15 17  three modes of data capture?

04:23:18 18        A.  Per the description, there seems like

04:23:33 19  there is some difference in terms of primarily

04:23:36 20  storage of data.

04:23:37 21        Q.  Okay.  Now, do you know what mode Bertoch

04:23:42 22  used?

04:23:43 23        A.  Looking at this description, it's not

04:24:18 24  clear.  I can only speculate.

04:24:22 25        Q.  And what do you think the mode of data


                                                                213










04:24:26  1  capture was?

04:24:27  2        A.  It would have to be either sample mode or

04:24:30  3  data log mode.

04:24:31  4        Q.  Okay.  And why do you think it could be

04:24:34  5  the sample mode?

04:24:39  6        A.  I didn't say it's the sample mode; I said

04:24:41  7  it's either sample mode or possibly data log mode.

04:24:45  8        Q.  Right.  So you definitely don't think it's

04:24:49  9  the survey mode?

04:24:52 10        A.  Well, the survey mode does not -- as it's

04:24:54 11  presented here, it's not describing any data capture

04:24:57 12  or recording, which we do know indeed that occurred

04:25:00 13  since we have the data log file.

04:25:02 14        Q.  Only the sample mode and the data log mode

04:25:05 15  have the data capture mode or capability?

04:25:08 16        A.  Seems to be the case.

04:25:10 17        Q.  But you don't know whether it was the

04:25:12 18  sample mode or data log mode that Bertoch used?

04:25:40 19        A.  That's correct.

04:25:40 20        Q.  Now, do you know what the temperature

04:25:46 21  range that this particular analyzer could be used

04:25:52 22  in?

04:25:57 23            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

04:26:00 24  incomplete hypothetical.

                                                                214










04:26:13  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:26:14  2        Q.  If it helps, Page 61 has the specifications.

04:26:24  3        A.  So the range of operation recommended

04:26:30  4  varies depending on what one is -- which sensor one

04:26:36  5  is looking at.

04:26:40  6            For example, for Co2, no range is

04:26:47  7  specified on Page 61.  For the temperature sensor,

04:26:52  8  there is a range up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, and

04:26:59  9  for the CO sensor, again, no specified range.

04:27:04 10        Q.  So are you saying that the Co2 sensor

04:27:08 11  could be operated at any temperature?

04:27:15 12        A.  What is being said on Page 61 would -- it

04:27:20 13  is a little bit unknown what that is; hence, when I

04:27:27 14  reviewed this, I tried to clarify that with the

04:27:36 15  calls at TSI.

04:27:36 16        Q.  Okay.  So we'll get to that in a minute.

04:27:41 17            So the temperature range for the

04:27:44 18  temperature sensor in this Q-Trak probe is between

04:27:49 19  32 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit; correct?

04:27:53 20        A.  That is what is in parentheses here.

04:27:58 21        Q.  Okay.  That's 0 to 50 degrees centigrade;

04:28:03 22  is that correct?

04:28:04 23        A.  That's correct.

04:28:05 24        Q.  And with respect to the carbon monoxide

04:28:11 25  sensor, what kind of a sensor is that?


                                                                215










04:28:12  1        A.  That is an electrochemical sensor.

04:28:14  2        Q.  Now, is that a typical sensor that's used

04:28:17  3  for combustion analysis?

04:28:18  4        A.  Yes.

04:28:18  5        Q.  And what's the maximum temperature range

04:28:22  6  in which an electrochemical sensor such as this can

04:28:26  7  operate?

04:28:27  8            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

04:28:28  9  incomplete hypothetical.

04:28:28 10            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure of the

04:28:30 11  manufacturer of this specific electrochemical

04:28:34 12  sensor, so it's hard for me to specifically answer

04:28:38 13  that question.

04:28:40 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:28:41 15        Q.  Now, what kind of a CO sensor does a Testo

04:28:45 16  device have?

04:28:47 17            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

04:28:49 18            THE WITNESS:  The Testo comprises of also

04:28:54 19  an electrochemical sensor; however, who manufacturers

04:28:57 20  that or if Testo itself manufacturers it, I don't

04:29:01 21  know.

04:29:01 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:29:16 23        Q.  Now, with respect to the accuracy of the

04:29:19 24  sensor, it is -- it says here plus or minus

04:29:24 25  3 percent of the reading or 3 PPM, whichever is


                                                                216










04:29:28  1  greater, and it says add plus or minus .5 degrees

04:29:36  2  centigrade away from calibration temperature.

04:29:38  3            What does that mean?

04:29:42  4            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

04:29:45  5            THE WITNESS:  This statement means that

04:29:52  6  the sensor, the concentration that it reads, would

04:29:55  7  have an accuracy of plus minus 3 percent of its

04:29:59  8  reading.  So, for example, if we are reading 100

04:30:04  9  PPM, it could be either 103 PPM or 97 PPM at its

04:30:13 10  calibrated temperature.

04:30:14 11            So if one is to calibrate this detector at

04:30:19 12  room temperature, 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and you

04:30:23 13  were taking a measurement at 70 degrees Fahrenheit,

04:30:27 14  you would only be considering the plus minus

04:30:31 15  3 percent accuracy.

04:30:33 16            However, if one is increasing or elevating

04:30:36 17  the temperature of operation, you must add

04:30:38 18  .28 percent of your reading in addition to the

04:30:40 19  3 percent, .28 percent per Fahrenheit that is

04:30:46 20  elevated above the calibrated temperature.

04:30:49 21            So if one again is taking a measurement at

04:30:52 22  100 degrees Fahrenheit and it has been calibrated at

04:31:02 23  70 degrees Fahrenheit, one would have to undertake a

04:31:07 24  calculation.  The difference in temperature is 30.

04:31:09 25  One would times that by .28, add plus 3 and then you


                                                                217










04:31:13  1  will have your percent accuracy that you would work

04:31:17  2  with.

04:31:20  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:31:20  4        Q.  So that would be 70 plus or minus 3 plus

04:31:26  5  .28 times 30?

04:31:29  6        A.  It's hard for me to see what you just did

04:31:39  7  there.  Maybe -- do you want to repeat it verbally?

04:31:41  8        Q.  Or you tell me.  If the device is

04:31:44  9  calibrated for 70 degrees --

04:31:45 10        A.  Yes.

04:31:51 11        Q.  -- but a temperature -- it's sensing

04:31:53 12  carbon monoxide at a temperature of 100 degrees,

04:31:54 13  what would the accuracy of that sensor be?  How

04:31:57 14  would it need to be adjusted?

04:31:59 15        A.  Sure.  So the difference in temperature is

04:32:07 16  important.  In your example, the one that I've put

04:32:07 17  forward, the difference is 30 degrees Fahrenheit,

04:32:08 18  100 minus 70.  30 degrees times .28, that is nearly

04:32:24 19  10-ish.  10 percent plus 3, that equals 13 percent.

04:32:26 20  Again, ballpark figures.

04:32:27 21            So when we have our measurement at

04:32:32 22  100 degrees Fahrenheit -- again, let's assume it's a

04:32:37 23  hundred parts per minute -- one would have to assume

04:32:40 24  that the possible ranges is not 100 PPM, although it

04:32:43 25  may be, but it can vary up to 100 PPM times


                                                                218










04:32:48  1  13 percent, which is 113 or 100 minus 13, which is

04:32:54  2  87.  So that would be the range one would be looking

04:32:59  3  at in that situation.

04:33:03  4        Q.  Okay.  And what does calibration

04:33:05  5  temperature mean, again?

04:33:06  6        A.  That means the temperature where the

04:33:10  7  detector or instrument was last calibrated.

04:33:15  8  Typically, it's in a laboratory or in a situation

04:33:20  9  where it would be typically room temperature.

04:33:24 10        Q.  And what's room temperature?

04:33:27 11        A.  Different people define it in different

04:33:29 12  ways.  Some people use 21 degrees Celsius; some

04:33:35 13  people use 70 degrees Fahrenheit just to keep

04:33:38 14  numbers whole.

04:33:39 15            So again, in this situation, calibration

04:33:41 16  temperature, I do not know what the definition is

04:33:43 17  because I don't know -- I think we possibly do have

04:33:45 18  that data, but I don't recall what it is.

04:33:48 19        Q.  And so do you have any idea as to what the

04:33:53 20  calibration temperature of the Q-Trak sensor was

04:33:59 21  that Bertoch used?

04:34:01 22        A.  Again, I do not recall.

04:34:03 23        Q.  Is it likely that it was ambient

04:34:06 24  temperature?

04:34:06 25        A.  I would be very surprised if one


                                                                219










04:34:10  1  calibrates this detector in an extreme environment.

04:34:13  2  Most likely, it would be a room temperature range.

04:34:16  3        Q.  Because it's an indoor air quality

04:34:20  4  monitor --

04:34:20  5        A.  Correct.

04:34:20  6        Q.  -- is that right?

04:34:21  7        A.  Correct.

04:34:22  8        Q.  Okay.  Now, with respect to the carbon

04:34:29  9  dioxide sensor, it says that its range is 0 to 5000

04:34:35 10  PPM.

04:34:36 11            What does that mean?

04:34:39 12        A.  That means that it has a detection range

04:34:41 13  from 0 to what it states here, 5000 parts per

04:34:47 14  million.

04:34:47 15        Q.  Okay.  What happens beyond 5000 PPM?

04:34:56 16        A.  Well, I'm not sure what happens, but it

04:34:58 17  seems to be in this data set that is before us that

04:35:01 18  it continues to register carbon dioxide above 5000,

04:35:06 19  and from various detectors that I have seen, that's

04:35:12 20  not unusual.

04:35:13 21        Q.  That detector is able to continue to

04:35:18 22  measure beyond their rated range?

04:35:20 23        A.  Sometimes, yes.

04:35:22 24        Q.  And what's the accuracy of such a reading?

04:35:26 25        A.  It would be as stated, plus minus


                                                                220










04:35:30  1  3 percent of the reading with the change in

04:35:35  2  temperature of accuracy.

04:35:36  3        Q.  Yeah, but that's with the change in

04:35:38  4  temperature.

04:35:40  5            But if it's reading at an ambient

04:35:47  6  temperature, at the temperature at which it's been

04:35:49  7  calibrated, but you stick the probe in an atmosphere

04:35:53  8  with carbon monoxide that's greater than 5000 PPM,

04:35:58  9  what happens in that situation?

04:36:01 10            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

04:36:02 11  vague and ambiguous.

04:36:05 12            THE WITNESS:  With regards to what

04:36:08 13  parameter?

04:36:09 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:36:09 15        Q.  Assume that it's been calibrated at

04:36:12 16  70 degrees Fahrenheit, ambient temperature.

04:36:16 17        A.  Sure.

04:36:16 18        Q.  And then you take this probe which is an

04:36:19 19  indoor air monitor and sample a stream of gas that

04:36:25 20  is at 6000 parts per million of carbon dioxide,

04:36:32 21  there's no temperature adjustment that you have to

04:36:37 22  do; correct?

04:36:37 23            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

04:36:38 24  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts

04:36:40 25  not in evidence.


                                                                221










04:36:40  1            THE WITNESS:  If I'm taking a measurement

04:36:42  2  at room temperature, I would just be taking the

04:36:45  3  first plus minus 3 percent accuracy rating.

04:36:49  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:36:49  5        Q.  Okay.  Even if it's beyond its recommended

04:36:51  6  range of 0 to 5000 PPM?

04:36:53  7        A.  If it's still recording data, obviously,

04:36:54  8  the engineers and the designers intended for that to

04:36:58  9  occur, and I have no reason not to infer the

04:37:02 10  accuracy within that span of data also.

04:37:06 11        Q.  But there's a reason why they say that the

04:37:09 12  range of operation for this device is from 0 to

04:37:13 13  5000 PPM; correct?

04:37:14 14        A.  I'm not sure.  You'll have to ask them.

04:37:17 15        Q.  And have you asked them?

04:37:18 16        A.  I did not.  That was not one of my

04:37:21 17  questions that I asked them.

04:37:21 18        Q.  Okay.  And then just like the CO sensor,

04:37:26 19  there has to be a temperature adjustment that needs

04:37:29 20  to be made for every degree of Fahrenheit above the

04:37:33 21  calibrated temperature; correct?

04:37:35 22        A.  That's correct.

04:37:35 23        Q.  Okay.  And that is .2 degrees plus or

04:37:40 24  minus per degree Fahrenheit; correct?

04:37:46 25        A.  That's correct.


                                                                222










04:37:48  1            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Let me hand you --

04:38:24  2            MR. JARCHI:  Can we take a break?

04:38:26  3            MR. TAYAB:  Yeah, sure.

04:38:30  4            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.

04:38:31  5  The time is 4:38 p.m.

04:38:31  6            (Whereupon, a recess was held

04:46:55  7            from 4:38 p.m. to 4:47 p.m.)

04:46:55  8            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the

04:46:56  9  beginning of Video Media 4 in the video deposition

04:47:01 10  of Kosmas Galatsis.  The time is 4:47 p.m.

04:47:06 11            MS. FREDERICK:  Are we back on the record?

04:47:08 12            MR. JARCHI:  Yes, we are.

04:47:08 13            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 23 was

04:47:08 14            marked for identification by the

04:47:08 15            deposition reporter and is attached

04:47:08 16            hereto.)

04:47:10 17            MR. TAYAB:  Dr. Galatsis, let me hand you

04:47:13 18  what's marked as Exhibit 23.  Will you take a look

04:47:16 19  at that and identify it for the record, please.

04:48:20 20            (Document reviewed by witness.)

04:48:20 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:48:21 22        Q.  Is that the declaration of Mr. Bertoch

04:48:25 23  dated November 2nd, 2016?

04:48:28 24        A.  Yes.

04:48:30 25        Q.  And does this declaration relate to


                                                                223










04:48:35  1  measurements that he made on the subject oven on

04:48:40  2  September 22nd, 2010?

04:48:42  3        A.  Yes.

04:48:43  4        Q.  And he used the Q-Trak 8554 air quality

04:48:52  5  monitor to test those results?

04:48:57  6        A.  That's correct.

04:48:57  7        Q.  And the results of his testing are

04:49:00  8  attached as Exhibit B to the declaration; is that

04:49:08  9  correct?

04:49:08 10        A.  Yes.

04:49:08 11        Q.  And have you reviewed these results

04:49:11 12  before?

04:49:16 13        A.  Yes, I have.

04:49:17 14        Q.  And these results that are attached relate

04:49:23 15  to what he calls Test ID Number 1; correct?

04:49:30 16        A.  May I ask, Test ID Number 1, where you're

04:49:34 17  referring?

04:49:35 18        Q.  The fifth line down in the Exhibit B.

04:49:40 19        A.  Yes.

04:49:40 20        Q.  Okay.  And have you had a chance to

04:49:47 21  evaluate these results before?

04:49:51 22        A.  I believe I have.

04:49:54 23        Q.  Now, those are the results that you

04:49:56 24  imported into this Excel spreadsheet in Exhibit 20;

04:50:00 25  correct?


                                                                224










04:50:00  1        A.  Yes, seems to be, yes.

04:50:02  2        Q.  Okay.  Would it be easier if we looked at

04:50:06  3  your data instead of this?

04:50:08  4        A.  Either way I'm fine.

04:50:10  5        Q.  Okay.

04:50:16  6        A.  How about we use Exhibit 20 so we're

04:50:20  7  consistent.

04:50:20  8        Q.  Okay.  And it's got all of the data points

04:50:22  9  on Exhibit B on Exhibit 20; is that correct?

04:50:26 10        A.  Yes.

04:50:27 11        Q.  You transferred all of the data points in

04:50:30 12  Exhibit 20; correct?

04:50:31 13        A.  Correct.

04:50:31 14        Q.  Okay.  So it may be easier just using

04:50:34 15  Exhibit 20.

04:50:36 16            Okay.  So there are 53 data points on this

04:50:49 17  data sheet; is that correct?

04:50:50 18        A.  It looks like it, yes.

04:50:52 19        Q.  Now, I notice here that not all of them

04:50:55 20  have time stamps.

04:50:56 21            Do you know why that is?

04:51:00 22        A.  It is because every -- every row

04:51:07 23  represents one-minute intervals so it's an even

04:51:07 24  interval.

04:51:13 25            So the second column where it says Time is


                                                                225










04:51:16  1  the minutes running into the data sequence, there

04:51:22  2  was only some key notations.  I placed a time stamp

04:51:26  3  where I transposed it onto the work sheet.

04:51:31  4        Q.  Okay.  So the data was gathered every

04:51:33  5  minute for 53 minutes for Test Series 1; is that

04:51:37  6  correct?

04:51:37  7        A.  That seems to be the case, yes.

04:51:40  8        Q.  Okay.  And where was the probe located

04:51:55  9  when these data were generated?

04:52:01 10        A.  I believe the probe was located, at least

04:52:05 11  initially, under the door, as we discussed

04:52:09 12  previously, and per Mr. Bertoch's notes, his

04:52:22 13  handwritten notes, it was moved at 2:47 and hung on

04:52:33 14  the rack, on the rack internal to the oven, as I

04:52:47 15  understood it.

04:52:48 16        Q.  Okay.  So Data Points 0 to 19 are

04:52:56 17  measuring with the probe under the door; is that

04:52:58 18  correct?

04:52:58 19        A.  Yes.

04:52:58 20        Q.  And Data Points 20 to 27, the door has

04:53:03 21  just been opened?

04:53:04 22        A.  Seems to be the case.

04:53:06 23        Q.  And then Data Points 28 to 53 is measuring

04:53:14 24  data with the probe where?

04:53:29 25        A.  It seems to be on a rack inside the oven.


                                                                226










04:53:37  1        Q.  Okay.  So the probe is hung on a rack and

04:53:41  2  the wire is under the door connected to the handheld

04:53:45  3  monitor?

04:53:45  4            MR. JARCHI:  Vague.

04:53:46  5            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure how the cord is

04:53:49  6  entering the oven, if it's on the side or under the

04:53:52  7  door, but it would seem to have to go through some

04:53:56  8  seal.  That's correct.

04:54:01  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:54:01 10        Q.  Okay.  Now, with respect to the

04:54:07 11  temperature for the readings between 0 to 19, what

04:54:16 12  do these temperature readings suggest to you?

04:54:19 13        A.  First and foremost that the temperature is

04:54:23 14  increasing.  So we see that trend.  That's basically

04:54:31 15  all I can conclude from the temperature reading.

04:54:35 16  It's going up, so it tells me that the temperature

04:54:40 17  sensor is experiencing an elevated temperature that

04:54:44 18  can only be internal of the bake chamber or the oven

04:54:48 19  as Mr. Bertoch is describing.

04:54:51 20        Q.  And what's the oven set to?

04:54:54 21        A.  Looking at Mr. Bertoch's notes, we see a

04:55:03 22  notation here, 375-400.

04:55:07 23        Q.  So for Data Points 0 to 19, what is it,

04:55:12 24  375 or 400?  What are you looking for?

04:55:55 25        A.  I'm looking for Mr. Brignola's notes.


                                                                227










04:56:04  1            MS. GARRISON:  19.

04:56:05  2            THE WITNESS:  Okay.

04:56:06  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:56:06  4        Q.  So you're looking at Brignola's notes for

04:56:10  5  Bertoch's data?

04:56:11  6        A.  I'm trying to see the start test period of

04:56:14  7  the 22nd, if there is any sign.

04:56:23  8            So in Mr. Brignola's notes, he has Test-1.

04:56:31  9  And again, I am assuming that the start sequence is

04:56:37 10  the same start sequence as Mr. Bertoch's, and he has

04:56:43 11  the T column constant at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:56:51 12            Now, that may have been the temperature

04:56:53 13  set for the start sequence of the 22nd of September,

04:57:00 14  but again, reading their testimonies, I don't recall

04:57:02 15  at this point in time that was the case.

04:57:05 16        Q.  But looking at Brignola's data for Test 1,

04:57:09 17  it seems to be that the oven temperature is set to

04:57:13 18  400 degrees Fahrenheit; is that right?

04:57:15 19        A.  It seems to be the case.

04:57:17 20        Q.  So would it be reasonable to believe that

04:57:20 21  the temperature setting for the Data Points 0 to 19

04:57:24 22  are with the oven set at 400 degrees Fahrenheit; is

04:57:32 23  that correct?

04:57:33 24        A.  In addition to Mr. Bertoch's marks, 375 to

04:57:37 25  400, that is possible.  I'm not sure.  I'm not


                                                                228










04:57:40  1  certain of that, but that is possible.

04:57:41  2        Q.  Okay.  But you're not 100 percent certain

04:57:44  3  whether it's 375 or 400 that Mr. Bertoch took his

04:57:48  4  data at?

04:57:49  5        A.  That's the way I'm reading it.

04:57:50  6        Q.  We'll have to infer from Mr. Brignola's

04:57:57  7  notes and say that it could be 400 but we're not

04:58:01  8  sure.

04:58:01  9        A.  I would agree with that.

04:58:02 10        Q.  Okay.  Now, we've talked previously about

04:58:03 11  the temperature of the oven as measured by

04:58:03 12  Mr. Brignola's as 292, but we're not seeing internal

04:58:10 13  temperatures anywhere near that range for Data

04:58:13 14  Points 0 to 19.

04:58:16 15            Do you have a view as to why that is?

04:58:25 16        A.  The 292, can you refresh my mind where

04:58:28 17  that is?

04:58:29 18        Q.  This is in Mr. Brignola's notes.

04:58:40 19        A.  Yes, I see it.

04:58:41 20        Q.  Okay.  So the temperature as measured here

04:58:42 21  for the same set of data points is less than half of

04:58:45 22  what they measured as the inside temperature of the

04:58:49 23  oven with Brignola's Testo device.

04:58:53 24            So my question to you was:  Do you have a

04:58:57 25  view as to why the temperatures are so much lower


                                                                229










04:59:01  1  with the Q-Trak device?

04:59:04  2            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

04:59:05  3  ambiguous, assumes facts, incomplete hypothetical.

04:59:10  4            THE WITNESS:  I don't -- I'm not certain

04:59:13  5  why that's the case.  I can only assume that it has

04:59:16  6  to do with the design of the probe and where the

04:59:20  7  thermocouple is located within the TSI probe and

04:59:26  8  within the combustion analyzer probe.

04:59:28  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

04:59:29 10        Q.  In the combustion analyzer probe, do you

04:59:33 11  know where the three sensors are located, the

04:59:35 12  temperature, the carbon monoxide and the oxygen

04:59:39 13  sensors are located?

04:59:40 14        A.  I've never used the Testo 330-2, the

04:59:45 15  subject Testo that we're referring to.  I have used

04:59:48 16  a Bacharach combustion analyzer and, typically, the

04:59:55 17  sensors CO and o2 are within the instrument, and the

05:00:01 18  thermocouple or temperature sensor is on the end of

05:00:04 19  the probe of the combustion analyzer, and it's

05:00:08 20  exposed.  It's an exposed element, so that the

05:00:14 21  combustion analyzer can detect temperature as close

05:00:17 22  as possible to the sample gas, unlike the TSI, which

05:00:24 23  has more plastic protection just visibly looking at

05:00:28 24  it for everyday use.

05:00:31 25            So again, I would have to assume that it


                                                                230










05:00:35  1  would be a dynamic situation where there's probably

05:00:38  2  more packaging around the thermocouple of the TSI

05:00:41  3  sensor than the Testo.

05:00:44  4        Q.  So you're saying that due to the packaging

05:00:49  5  of the Q-Trak sensor, the temperature probe is

05:00:52  6  unable to measure the temperature of the environment

05:00:56  7  it is in?

05:00:57  8            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

05:00:58  9  testimony.  It assumes facts.  It's an incomplete

05:01:01 10  hypothetical.  It assumes that the 292 is from a

05:01:04 11  thermocouple, not from the measured temperature on

05:01:07 12  the oven.

05:01:08 13            THE WITNESS:  That's not what I said.

05:01:10 14  It's just a matter of time.  It may take a little

05:01:14 15  longer for the TSI to measure that temperature than

05:01:17 16  a combustion analyzer temperature for a thermocouple

05:01:25 17  would.

05:01:25 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:01:26 19        Q.  So, say, for example, the 10th data point

05:01:32 20  on your sheet, it's recording a temperature of 85.

05:01:38 21            Is it fair to say that that data point is

05:01:42 22  being measured ten minutes into the test cycle?

05:01:46 23        A.  I'm not sure exactly when they started

05:01:51 24  this data log and when they turned on the oven, so I

05:01:57 25  can't give you a definitive answer to that.


                                                                231










05:01:59  1        Q.  But it says that the data log was started

05:02:01  2  at 2:19, so you have a definitive start time here.

05:02:05  3            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstates the

05:02:07  4  testimony, asked and answered.

05:02:08  5            THE WITNESS:  I don't understand the

05:02:13  6  question.

05:02:13  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:02:15  8        Q.  You said, did you not, that you don't know

05:02:19  9  at what time the data log started --

05:02:20 10            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:02:22 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:02:23 12        Q.  -- and I'm just pointing out the data log

05:02:26 13  appears to have started at 14:19, as this data log

05:02:31 14  suggests.

05:02:31 15            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:02:32 16            THE WITNESS:  I must have misspoke, but

05:02:34 17  that's not what I was referring to.

05:02:36 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:02:36 19        Q.  I'm sorry.  Please clarify.

05:02:38 20        A.  We do indeed see the data log starting at

05:02:41 21  2:19 p.m.; however, we don't know exactly when the

05:02:44 22  oven started or was started.

05:02:48 23        Q.  Okay.  Regardless, by the time the 10th

05:02:52 24  data point was taken, is it fair to say that the

05:02:56 25  oven was running for ten minutes?


                                                                232










05:02:59  1        A.  I don't have the time stamp of when the

05:03:03  2  oven begun for me to answer that question.

05:03:03  3        Q.  Okay.

05:03:09  4        A.  So in that question you're assuming both

05:03:12  5  were turned on simultaneously, the logging and the

05:03:15  6  oven, and I don't see any data that I can infer that

05:03:18  7  that is the case.

05:03:19  8        Q.  Okay.  Now, is the oven on when the data

05:03:24  9  was begun to be logged at 4:19?

05:03:28 10        A.  I don't know.  At that specific minute, I

05:03:35 11  don't know.

05:03:35 12        Q.  So when do you think, from Data Point 0 to

05:03:45 13  Data Point 19 -- strike that.

05:03:50 14            Was the oven on when Data Points 0 to 19

05:03:55 15  were generated?

05:04:03 16            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and

05:04:04 17  ambiguous.

05:04:04 18            THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.

05:04:06 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:04:06 20        Q.  Okay.  So the oven was on for all 19 data

05:04:07 21  points; is that right?

05:04:07 22            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and

05:04:08 23  ambiguous.

05:04:08 24            THE WITNESS:  Again, I haven't seen data

05:04:10 25  to tell me, to infer that point.


                                                                233










05:04:17  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:04:17  2        Q.  I don't understand what you're saying.

05:04:19  3            Was the oven on or off when these first 19

05:04:24  4  data points were taken?

05:04:25  5            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, 19.  The

05:04:27  6  question's vague and ambiguous.

05:04:31  7            THE WITNESS:  The data started logging at

05:04:35  8  2:19.  We do not know sometime after that point or

05:04:41  9  before at what exact time the oven was turned on.

05:04:46 10            All we could see and infer from here are

05:04:50 11  the CO and temperature and increase in Co2 data

05:04:55 12  points to give us some understanding of when the

05:04:57 13  actual burner was enabled.

05:05:00 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:05:00 15        Q.  Okay.  And so looking at these data

05:05:05 16  points, in your view, when was the burner enabled?

05:05:10 17        A.  I don't have the data from Mr. Burtoch nor

05:05:23 18  Mr. Brignola that tells me when they turned the oven

05:05:27 19  on.

05:05:27 20        Q.  Okay.  So what data points are you relying

05:05:34 21  upon as valid data points from 0 to 19, if any?

05:05:42 22            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

05:05:43 23  ambiguous.

05:05:43 24            THE WITNESS:  The data set that we have

05:05:46 25  before us communicate to me that there is an


                                                                234










05:05:52  1  increase in temperature at a certain period of time.

05:05:58  2  It also tells me there's an increase in carbon

05:06:03  3  monoxide and an increase in carbon dioxide.

05:06:06  4            So exactly when that process, the

05:06:09  5  combustion process begins is unknown exactly at the

05:06:15  6  minute where that begins.  It could be at 2; it

05:06:20  7  could be at negative 2; it could be at 0.  We do not

05:06:25  8  have that time stamp to superimpose when the oven

05:06:28  9  was turned on with this data set.  I have not seen

05:06:31 10  it.  I have not seen it.

05:06:33 11        Q.  Okay.  What about Data Point 5; do you

05:06:37 12  think the combustion process has started at that

05:06:44 13  point?

05:06:44 14        A.  I don't know.

05:06:44 15        Q.  What about Data Point 10?

05:06:47 16        A.  Absolutely.

05:06:48 17        Q.  Why do you say absolutely?

05:06:50 18        A.  Because we have three markers of

05:06:54 19  combustion.  One is an increase in temperature, an

05:06:59 20  increase in carbon monoxide and an increase in

05:07:04 21  carbon dioxide.

05:07:07 22        Q.  Now, with respect to the temperature, it

05:07:09 23  says 85.1; correct?

05:07:11 24        A.  Yes.

05:07:12 25        Q.  Do you think that's the accurate


                                                                235










05:07:14  1  reflection of the temperature of the air that's

05:07:21  2  being sampled at that point?

05:07:23  3        A.  That is the reflection of the air touching

05:07:25  4  the thermocouple of the IAQ, and I believe it's in

05:07:32  5  close distance to the carbon monoxide sensor.

05:07:36  6        Q.  Okay.  But that temperature is reflective

05:07:40  7  of what?

05:07:40  8        A.  Of what the carbon monoxide sensor of the

05:07:43  9  TSI Q-Trak is feeling or sensing.

05:07:47 10        Q.  And where is the carbon monoxide sensor

05:07:50 11  located?

05:07:51 12        A.  It is located on the probe of the

05:07:54 13  instrument.

05:07:54 14        Q.  And the probe is completely inside the

05:07:57 15  oven, is it not?

05:07:58 16        A.  Per Mr. Bertoch's testimony, yes.

05:08:01 17        Q.  So the thermocouple would be measuring the

05:08:07 18  temperature inside the oven, would it not?

05:08:09 19        A.  It would be measuring the environment that

05:08:11 20  the CO sensor is experiencing within that probe.

05:08:15 21        Q.  And would the probe, the CO sensor, not be

05:08:24 22  at the same temperature as -- or not be

05:08:27 23  substantially at the same temperature at which the

05:08:30 24  surrounding gases are?

05:08:32 25        A.  Again, given the design of the probe and


                                                                236










05:08:37  1  the intention of the designers to reflect the

05:08:40  2  temperature, it would definitely be in close

05:08:43  3  proximity to the CO detector, because that is indeed

05:08:49  4  its function, to represent the temperature of the

05:08:51  5  sample gas which -- what does the sampling, what

05:08:56  6  does the sampling is the CO and Co2 sensors.

05:09:00  7            So it would -- again, as an engineer, as a

05:09:03  8  designer, it would make good sense to me that

05:09:06  9  they're in good proximity, and I believe that would

05:09:09 10  be the case.  I've seen no other data to tell me

05:09:13 11  otherwise.

05:09:13 12        Q.  Okay.  And why doesn't this temperature,

05:09:16 13  that's the 85 degrees for the 10th data point,

05:09:19 14  correlate with the temperature as measured by the

05:09:25 15  Testo device?

05:09:26 16            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony

05:09:29 17  and the evidence, including Exhibit 68 of Brignola's

05:09:34 18  deposition.

05:09:34 19            THE WITNESS:  I don't know that it is in

05:09:39 20  any way different.

05:09:49 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:09:49 22        Q.  Now, can you locate for me the data point

05:09:52 23  in Test 1 that corresponds with Bertoch's 40 PPM on

05:09:58 24  this chart on Exhibit 20?

05:10:11 25        A.  So we shouldn't forget this is sampling


                                                                237










05:10:14  1  and averaging every minute.  The exact time

05:10:20  2  Mr. Brignola looked at the TSI and made a

05:10:30  3  handwritten note, I'm not sure when that was or it

05:10:33  4  corresponded exactly with the seconds of this time

05:10:36  5  stamp.  So it's hard to compare both.

05:10:44  6        Q.  So what you're saying is you're unable to

05:10:47  7  tell -- you're unable to tell why there's no

05:10:51  8  correlation between the temperature as measured by

05:10:55  9  Brignola and the temperature as measured by

05:10:59 10  Burtoch --

05:11:00 11            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:11:01 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:11:02 13        Q.  -- for the two tests?

05:11:03 14            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:11:05 15            THE WITNESS:  I never said I'm unable; I

05:11:08 16  just don't have the information to do that.

05:11:09 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:11:10 18        Q.  Is it because the Q-Trak device is not

05:11:14 19  rated to measuring temperatures above 122 degrees

05:11:22 20  Fahrenheit?

05:11:23 21            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstates the

05:11:25 22  testimony.

05:11:25 23            THE WITNESS:  Can you repeat the question,

05:11:27 24  please?

05:11:27 25  ///


                                                                238










05:11:27  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:11:28  2        Q.  Is it because the temperature probe in the

05:11:30  3  Q-Trak sensor is not designed to measure a

05:11:36  4  temperature above 122 degrees Fahrenheit?

05:11:40  5            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstates the

05:11:42  6  testimony, assumes facts.

05:11:43  7            THE WITNESS:  Based on this data log, we

05:11:46  8  have temperature reaching 140 degrees and saturating

05:11:51  9  of 140 degrees, not above 140 degrees.  So there's

05:11:55 10  some contradiction with regard to the specification

05:12:00 11  as stated from the manual in -- from TSI, from your

05:12:04 12  Exhibit 22.

05:12:07 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:12:07 14        Q.  Now, is this temperature probe capable of

05:12:10 15  measuring temperatures that are typical of the

05:12:16 16  temperatures inside a bake chamber of an oven?

05:12:20 17            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

05:12:21 18  incomplete hypothetical.

05:12:25 19            THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase the

05:12:26 20  question, please?

05:12:27 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:12:27 22        Q.  Would you use a Q-Trak to measure the

05:12:34 23  conditions inside of a bake chamber like the subject

05:12:37 24  oven?

05:12:38 25            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,


                                                                239










05:12:40  1  vague and ambiguous.

05:12:41  2            THE WITNESS:  If that's the only

05:12:42  3  instrument I had, I would.

05:12:43  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:12:44  5        Q.  If you had to choose an instrument, would

05:12:46  6  you choose that instrument, an indoor air monitor,

05:12:50  7  to measure combustion gases at elevated

05:12:54  8  temperatures?

05:12:54  9        A.  If I had a choice, I would be choosing a

05:12:58 10  combustion analyzer.

05:12:59 11        Q.  And why is that?

05:13:01 12        A.  Specifically, because a combustion

05:13:03 13  analyzer is designed for combustion analysis.

05:13:07 14        Q.  And an indoor air analyzer is designed to

05:13:10 15  analyze indoor air and not combustion air; correct?

05:13:14 16        A.  Correct.

05:13:16 17        Q.  In other words, Bertoch's measuring device

05:13:21 18  was the wrong one for this application; correct?

05:13:23 19            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony.

05:13:26 20  It's argumentative.

05:13:28 21            THE WITNESS:  The TSI, I wouldn't

05:13:30 22  characterize it as the wrong one.  Under certain

05:13:34 23  circumstances, indeed, one can take certain points

05:13:39 24  and translate that into something useful.

05:13:45 25            For extensive daily use as a combustion


                                                                240










05:13:48  1  analyzer, to use an indoor TSI Q-Trak detector, that

05:13:52  2  would not be my choice.  But in a situation where

05:13:56  3  one does not have a choice, one can indeed obtain

05:14:00  4  limited information under certain specifications and

05:14:05  5  circumstances.

05:14:05  6        Q.  And what limited information and in what

05:14:09  7  specific circumstances?

05:14:09  8            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and

05:14:11  9  ambiguous.

05:14:11 10            THE WITNESS:  Within the specifications of

05:14:13 11  the TSI and correct use of the instrument.

05:14:19 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:14:19 13        Q.  Okay.  And was Burtoch making correct use

05:14:23 14  of the instrument in measuring combustion gases in

05:14:26 15  this instance?

05:14:27 16            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

05:14:28 17            THE WITNESS:  Given his situation after

05:14:30 18  reading his testimony and the boundary conditions

05:14:34 19  given to him by his employing client, he had no

05:14:41 20  choice at the time.  I'm sure he would have chosen a

05:14:47 21  different detector if he had the choice and time.

05:14:50 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:14:51 23        Q.  So you're saying he didn't have adequate

05:14:54 24  time to choose the right kind of detector; this was

05:14:58 25  the only detector he had, thus, he used this


                                                                241










05:15:01  1  detector.

05:15:02  2            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, argumentative as to

05:15:02  3  the right detector, misstates the testimony.

05:15:03  4            THE WITNESS:  Based on his testimony, it

05:15:05  5  was clear to me that he had limited options under

05:15:07  6  the circumstances, and he did the best he could to

05:15:10  7  gain some data from the 22nd inspection,

05:15:16  8  September 22nd, 2010 inspection, again, given the

05:15:20  9  boundary conditions set by him.

05:15:23 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:15:23 11        Q.  And what in your view is the reliability

05:15:26 12  of this data that he generated in those challenging

05:15:30 13  circumstances?

05:15:30 14            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

05:15:31 15  ambiguous, assumes facts and argumentative,

05:15:35 16  misstates the testimony.

05:15:37 17            THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase that?

05:15:38 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:15:39 19        Q.  Do you consider this data to be reliable?

05:15:42 20            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

05:15:43 21            THE WITNESS:  Some of it is reliable.

05:15:45 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:15:46 23        Q.  Which data is reliable?

05:15:48 24        A.  The data that I have used.

05:15:50 25        Q.  Tell me exactly which data points you


                                                                242










05:15:54  1  think among the 53 are reliable.

05:16:00  2        A.  So I, in my declaration, have used Row

05:16:11  3  Number 18.

05:16:12  4        Q.  Any other data point that falls within the

05:16:15  5  relevant reliability, in your mind?

05:16:24  6        A.  Row Number 19.

05:16:26  7        Q.  Any others?

05:16:28  8            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

05:16:34  9            THE WITNESS:  And other data points that

05:16:35 10  are within the specifications of the detector,

05:16:40 11  including additional specifications I obtained with

05:16:43 12  my call to TSI.

05:16:46 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:16:46 14        Q.  Just in these 53, just identify for me

05:16:49 15  each and every one of these data points that you

05:16:51 16  consider reliable data.

05:16:53 17        A.  The data that I've used in my declaration

05:16:57 18  is reliable.

05:16:57 19        Q.  No.  Just identify for me from 0 to 53

05:17:01 20  which data points you consider to be reliable.

05:17:05 21  You've identified two.

05:17:07 22            Are there any others that you consider to

05:17:09 23  be reliable?

05:17:14 24            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous --

05:17:16 25            THE WITNESS:  Again, I would have to


                                                                243










05:17:17  1  say --

05:17:17  2            MR. JARCHI:  -- incomplete hypothetical.

05:17:19  3            THE WITNESS:  I would have to say all the

05:17:21  4  data points that fit into the specifications of the

05:17:26  5  detector per the instruction manual and the

05:17:31  6  additional data I have from my calls, my multiple

05:17:36  7  calls to TSI.

05:17:37  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:17:38  9        Q.  So identify for me again which out of the

05:17:40 10  53 you consider to be reliable.

05:17:42 11            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

05:17:42 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:17:43 13        Q.  It's a simple question.

05:17:44 14        A.  It is a simple question.  I'm giving you a

05:17:48 15  simple answer.  It's actually in my declaration.

05:17:52 16  It's Column Number -- Row Number 18 I believe is a

05:17:54 17  reliable data point.

05:17:55 18        Q.  Okay.  Any others other than 19?

05:17:58 19            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

05:17:59 20            THE WITNESS:  Row Number 19 and the others

05:18:07 21  that are within the temperature CO and Co2 specs.

05:18:11 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:18:11 23        Q.  Okay.  Indulge me.  Which ones are those?

05:18:14 24        A.  There are multiple of them here.

05:18:18 25        Q.  We've got the time.  Tell me each one that


                                                                244










05:18:21  1  you consider reliable.

05:18:25  2        A.  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  We have a

05:18:43  3  saturated Co2, still 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

05:18:54  4  16, 17, the CO is reliable.  Co2 has been saturated.

05:19:02  5        Q.  Oh, so you're making a distinction here

05:19:06  6  between which of the three probes you consider

05:19:09  7  reliable?

05:19:10  8        A.  There's not three probes; there's three

05:19:14  9  sensors.

05:19:14 10        Q.  Sorry.  Strike that.

05:19:16 11            Which one of the three sensors are

05:19:18 12  reliable?

05:19:19 13        A.  Just as the manufacturer distinguishes

05:19:21 14  each sensor and gives it its own specifications like

05:19:24 15  I am.  I'm also distinguishing, given its operation,

05:19:27 16  the various data points that's reliable.

05:19:35 17        Q.  So you're saying Data Points 0 to 19 in

05:19:37 18  your view are all reliable data points?

05:19:39 19            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:19:40 20            THE WITNESS:  I just answered that a

05:19:41 21  minute ago and that's not what I said.

05:19:44 22            I said up to 7, Co2, CO temperature is

05:19:49 23  good.  Once the Co2 starts saturating 8 to 17, Co2

05:19:55 24  seems to have saturated.  So I would not be taking

05:20:00 25  that Co2 as the real Co2 as detected; however, I


                                                                245










05:20:11  1  would be taking the set up to -- the CO column up to

05:20:21  2  the point where we reach, as mentioned by TSI and

05:20:29  3  guided me by TSI up to...

05:20:45  4            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 24 was

05:20:45  5            marked for identification by the

05:20:45  6            deposition reporter and is attached

05:20:45  7            hereto.)

05:20:46  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:20:46  9        Q.  Let me introduce Exhibit 24.  Would you

05:20:48 10  take a look at that and identify it for the record,

05:20:51 11  please.

05:20:51 12        A.  Thank you.  This is my notes taken that

05:20:55 13  summarize my numerous -- my four calls with TSI, the

05:21:02 14  manufacturer of the measurement instrument used by

05:21:08 15  Mr. Bertoch on the 22nd of September 2010, which,

05:21:14 16  cutting a long story short, highlights that the CO

05:21:22 17  sensor data is valid up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

05:21:27 18        Q.  So you're saying up to the 31st reading --

05:21:38 19        A.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I misspoke.

05:21:41 20  Excuse me.  Up to -- CO measurements up to 122

05:21:49 21  degrees Fahrenheit.

05:21:50 22        Q.  Which is up to Reading Number 21?

05:21:55 23            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:22:01 24            THE WITNESS:  Up to Reading 20, excluding

05:22:11 25  21.


                                                                246










05:22:13  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:22:14  2        Q.  Okay.  But then including 22?

05:22:24  3        A.  Including 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

05:23:09  4        Q.  So, essentially, anything where the

05:23:15  5  temperature indicates less than 122 degrees you're

05:23:21  6  accepting the CO values as reliable; is that

05:23:26  7  correct?

05:23:26  8        A.  Per my discussions with TSI and confirmed,

05:23:31  9  yes.

05:23:32 10        Q.  Now, which one of the temperature values

05:23:34 11  are you considering to be reliable?

05:23:42 12        A.  Up to Row 29.

05:23:48 13        Q.  So all the temperatures from 0 to 29 you

05:23:52 14  consider to be reliable data points for temperature?

05:23:57 15        A.  I consider your definition of reliable

05:24:00 16  being what the thermocouple, its surrounding air is

05:24:05 17  detecting, that is the true temperature at that

05:24:08 18  location within the probe, correct.

05:24:10 19        Q.  And the probe is entirely located within

05:24:13 20  the bake chamber; is that correct?

05:24:14 21        A.  Based on Mr. Bertoch's testimony and

05:24:18 22  explanation and notations, I believe that's the

05:24:21 23  case.

05:24:21 24        Q.  And if the inside temperature of the bake

05:24:25 25  chamber is 300 degrees Fahrenheit, for example --


                                                                247










05:24:28  1            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

05:24:30  2  evidence.

05:24:30  3            MR. TAYAB:  I haven't finished.

05:24:31  4            MR. JARCHI:  Okay.

05:24:32  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:24:32  6        Q.  If the inside of the bake chamber is at

05:24:37  7  300 degrees Fahrenheit, what would the temperature

05:24:39  8  probe measure as the temperature?

05:24:41  9            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

05:24:43 10  evidence and misstates the testimony.

05:24:44 11            THE WITNESS:  I haven't undertaken that

05:24:46 12  analysis.

05:24:46 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:24:47 14        Q.  If it's a temperature sensor, shouldn't it

05:24:50 15  be measuring the ambient temperature around the

05:24:54 16  probe?

05:24:55 17            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

05:24:56 18  vague and ambiguous.

05:24:59 19            THE WITNESS:  Yes, but we just explained a

05:25:02 20  moment ago that the thermocouple is located -- we've

05:25:06 21  seen the plastic packaging and housing of the probe

05:25:06 22  itself.  It will be reading what the temperature is

05:25:11 23  within that housing.  It's not reading the same

05:25:18 24  temperature as the thermocouple, for example, within

05:25:20 25  the oven, which is located in a different part of


                                                                248










05:25:22  1  the oven, in a different enclosure, design,

05:25:26  2  material.

05:25:27  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:25:27  4        Q.  So in your view, the temperature that is

05:25:29  5  being measured is not the ambient temperature but

05:25:34  6  the temperature at which the CO probe is; is that

05:25:38  7  correct?

05:25:38  8            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

05:25:40  9  incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.

05:25:42 10            THE WITNESS:  The temperature the probe is

05:25:44 11  reading is coming from the thermocouple within the

05:25:49 12  TSI Q-Trak probe placed under the door in the oven.

05:25:52 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:25:54 14        Q.  What temperature is the temperature probe

05:25:56 15  measuring?

05:25:56 16            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

05:25:58 17            THE WITNESS:  I believe I answered that

05:26:01 18  with very good clarity.

05:26:03 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:26:04 20        Q.  I'm still not clear.

05:26:05 21            What temperature is the temperature probe

05:26:07 22  measuring?

05:26:08 23            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

05:26:11 24            THE WITNESS:  The temperature probe, or

05:26:15 25  specifically the thermocouple that is located within


                                                                249










05:26:20  1  the probe of the TSI Q-Trak, is measuring air, toxic

05:26:25  2  gas air within the oven that is diffusing onto the

05:26:31  3  thermocouple itself.

05:26:33  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:26:34  5        Q.  Does that air chill by the time it

05:26:36  6  diffuses into the thermocouple from the oven?

05:26:43  7            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

05:26:44  8  incomplete hypothetical.

05:26:44  9            THE WITNESS:  Does it chill?  I would not

05:26:46 10  say it chills.

05:26:47 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:26:47 12        Q.  Does it cool down in any way?

05:26:50 13            MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.

05:26:51 14            THE WITNESS:  I haven't seen, again, any

05:26:53 15  data, any refrigeration mechanism on the probe

05:26:57 16  itself to give me an indication that it is

05:27:02 17  decreasing the temperature of the ambient air.

05:27:06 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:27:10 19        Q.  Now, if the Q-Trak device were used to

05:27:12 20  measure the carbon monoxide level in this room, for

05:27:15 21  example, and this room is at 70 degrees Fahrenheit,

05:27:19 22  what temperature would that temperature probe in the

05:27:23 23  Q-Trak display?

05:27:26 24            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical.

05:27:31 25            THE WITNESS:  When you place a temperature


                                                                250










05:27:34  1  probe like that from the Q-Trak in this room, it

05:27:38  2  will display the temperature of the room.  It will,

05:27:42  3  because the temperature within a room, an

05:27:45  4  environment is not changing in a rapid fashion, nor

05:27:50  5  is it changing what -- it is changing on startup

05:27:55  6  within the oven as we see from the logged data.

05:28:01  7            It's a dynamic environment that we see in

05:28:05  8  an oven cavity, especially with a massively gorged,

05:28:09  9  disintegrated heat exchange.  We have numerous

05:28:16 10  things to fix going on with respect to a steady

05:28:19 11  state, fairly stable situation in a typical indoor

05:28:23 12  environment.

05:28:23 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:28:24 14        Q.  So the Q-Trak temperature sensor is not

05:28:29 15  capable of measuring changes in temperature; is that

05:28:33 16  what you're saying?

05:28:34 17            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony --

05:28:37 18            THE WITNESS:  No.

05:28:38 19            MR. JARCHI:  -- incomplete hypothetical.

05:28:39 20            THE WITNESS:  That is not what I'm saying.

05:28:41 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:28:42 22        Q.  So if I go from this room which is at

05:28:44 23  70 degrees Fahrenheit and it's a hundred degrees

05:28:49 24  outside, I walk out, will the temperature probe

05:28:51 25  still say 70 or will it say 100?


                                                                251










05:28:55  1            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

05:28:57  2  incomplete hypothetical.

05:28:59  3            THE WITNESS:  At some point in time, based

05:29:01  4  on the specifications of the sensor, the response

05:29:03  5  time states -- as stated here, there's a 30-second

05:29:07  6  response time -- given a certain air velocity and

05:29:10  7  situation, it will abide by that dynamic response

05:29:15  8  time and it will come up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit

05:29:18  9  when you step out.  Absolutely.  It will change

05:29:21 10  according to --

05:29:21 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:29:22 12        Q.  In how much time did you say?

05:29:23 13        A.  Well, given the specification here under

05:29:25 14  temperature sensor, we see the response time, which

05:29:28 15  is 90 percent of the full value, T 90 percent is 30

05:29:33 16  seconds, under air velocity at 2 meters per second.

05:29:40 17        Q.  Okay.  So within 30 seconds, it would

05:29:42 18  reach a hundred degrees when I step outside if it's

05:29:45 19  a hundred degrees outside?

05:29:47 20        A.  It would be 90 percent of the difference --

05:29:47 21        Q.  90 percent of the difference.

05:29:52 22        A.  -- if there is a 2 meter per second air

05:29:53 23  flow, and I would presume if there isn't, it would

05:29:54 24  take longer.

05:29:55 25        Q.  Okay.  And now those conditions are not


                                                                252










05:29:59  1  present inside the bake chamber?

05:30:01  2        A.  I don't know if they are or not.

05:30:03  3        Q.  Okay.  So you don't think that the

05:30:05  4  2 meters per second air flow rate is tied to the

05:30:08  5  bake chamber?

05:30:08  6            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

05:30:11  7            THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  There could

05:30:12  8  be more; there could be less in different parts of

05:30:15  9  the oven.  It could be -- again, it could vary.  I

05:30:19 10  haven't undertaken that analysis.

05:30:22 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:30:22 12        Q.  Okay.  Now, with respect to the carbon

05:30:24 13  dioxide readings, you said that the first seven

05:30:29 14  readings are reliable?

05:30:34 15        A.  Reliable in the sense again of the

05:30:37 16  instrument being used under the specifications, and

05:30:42 17  I don't see anything here for me to have an issue

05:30:47 18  with these -- the raw data coming from the data log.

05:30:51 19        Q.  Okay.  So at a carbon dioxide PPM level of

05:30:57 20  5,998, you still consider that data to be a reliable

05:31:02 21  measure of Co2 concentration; is that correct?

05:31:07 22        A.  Yes.

05:31:08 23        Q.  Even though the specifications say that

05:31:11 24  the range for the Co2 detector is 0 to 5000; is that

05:31:16 25  correct?


                                                                253










05:31:16  1            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

05:31:19  2  vague and ambiguous.

05:31:19  3            THE WITNESS:  I would assume as a user of

05:31:23  4  this instrument if the instrument is giving me this

05:31:26  5  data set that it is valid.  If it is not valid, it

05:31:33  6  would either saturate, as we see at 6000 for Co2, as

05:31:38  7  we see for 140 for temperature, and if there's

05:31:41  8  anything else, it may be designed to read invalid if

05:31:47  9  there's an electrical problem or something similar.

05:31:50 11        Q.  So your testimony is that at 6000 PPM, the

05:31:53 12  carbon dioxide test will saturate and will not read

05:31:58 13  any additional values; is that correct?

05:32:02 14        A.  It seems to be the case.

05:32:03 15        Q.  So as long as it's not saturated, any data

05:32:04 16  point below that level is valid, in your mind?

05:32:09 17        A.  If I am receiving data from the instrument

05:32:14 18  like we have here from a reputable company, I would

05:32:25 19  take that as valid data.

05:32:25 20        Q.  Now, you've mentioned several times that

05:32:29 21  you spoke to TSI.

05:32:37 22            Now, is Exhibit 24 a reflection of your

05:32:38 23  notes of conversations you had with TSI?

05:32:42 24        A.  Yes.

05:32:42 25        Q.  Okay.  So the first time you talked to


                                                                254










05:32:44  1  them was on August 18, 2016; correct?

05:32:50  2        A.  Yes.

05:32:50  3        Q.  And so your question to the technical

05:32:57  4  support representative at TSI was what does invalid

05:33:00  5  mean in CO sensor reading.

05:33:04  6            Why did you ask that question?

05:33:05  7        A.  Because we have an invalid row on 30 and

05:33:13  8  31 of Exhibit 20, and I was trying to deduce what

05:33:17  9  the definition of invalid was because I could not

05:33:20 10  locate it within the instruction manual.

05:33:24 11        Q.  And what was his response?

05:33:27 12        A.  As shown here on Exhibit 24, he mentions

05:33:32 13  that there is a problem with the voltage.  Even just

05:33:37 14  one sample reading poorly, he will classify the

05:33:38 15  whole reading as invalid.

05:33:41 16            So it does not mean the sensor is

05:33:44 17  malfunctioning.  So I believe I understood it as an

05:33:49 18  engineer that there would have been a spike in the

05:33:52 19  signal coming to the microprocessor or the analog or

05:33:55 20  digital converter.

05:33:56 21            There was some information that couldn't

05:33:59 22  be processed, and instead of trying to capture that,

05:34:03 23  it just strikes it and places an invalid input.

05:34:08 24  That's the way I understood it.

05:34:09 25        Q.  Okay.  And then on October 6th, you talked


                                                                255










05:34:14  1  with the technical support representative again and

05:34:17  2  asked:

05:34:17  3                "Can I use the CO data at

05:34:20  4            140 degrees Fahrenheit."

05:34:22  5            And his view was:

05:34:24  6                 "Best not to, should not

05:34:26  7            since the air quality detector

05:34:27  8            is at 140F.  In addition, we do

05:34:31  9            not know the accurate temperature

05:34:31 10            to undertake an offset

05:34:33 11            calculation.  Can use data only

05:34:37 12            within temperature

05:34:40 13            specifications."

05:34:41 14            So what did you understand from that?

05:34:41 15        A.  I understood that at 140, the temperature

05:34:47 16  as we see on the data log on Exhibit 20 in the

05:34:47 17  temperature column, the temperature saturates at

05:34:50 18  140, and since it doesn't go beyond 140, we don't

05:34:56 19  have the temperature data to perform the offset

05:35:00 20  accuracy calculation for the CO sensor.  And that's

05:35:03 21  the way I understood it from his column as

05:35:06 22        Q.  So anything above 140 -- or anything at

05:35:08 23  140 is data you cannot use?

05:35:11 24        A.  Anything above 140, because we know it is

05:35:16 25  at 140, but above it, we don't know.  So, yes, you


                                                                256










05:35:19  1  are correct.  By definition, at 140, best not to

05:35:23  2  use.

05:35:39  3        Q.  Now, in this data for Bertoch, what

05:35:43  4  specific data points are you relying on for your

05:35:47  5  opinions?

05:35:47  6            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

05:35:48  7  ambiguous as to "this data."  Asked and answered.

05:35:52  8            THE WITNESS:  Well, specifically within my

05:35:57  9  declaration, I have selected the Row Number 18.

05:36:03 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:36:03 11        Q.  So you have mentioned in your declaration

05:36:05 12  that Row Number 18 is reliable data; is that

05:36:12 13  correct?

05:36:12 14        A.  It's a reliable data point along with the

05:36:15 15  other points that I've chosen from a separate

05:36:18 16  instrument, Testo instrument and other analyses,

05:36:22 17  correct.

05:36:22 18        Q.  Notwithstanding the other instrument, with

05:36:25 19  respect to this instrument, you consider Data

05:36:28 20  Point 18 to be a valid and relevant data point;

05:36:31 21  correct?

05:36:32 22        A.  Yes.

05:36:32 23        Q.  Notwithstanding the fact that it's about

05:36:37 24  999 PPM above the manufacturer's specified range of

05:36:41 25  5000 PPM for the Co2 sensor; correct?


                                                                257










05:36:44  1            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony,

05:36:45  2  vague and ambiguous.

05:36:45  3            THE WITNESS:  Again, the detector is

05:36:47  4  outputting this Co2 concentration to the user, and I

05:36:53  5  am taking that at face value that it is valid set of

05:36:58  6  data.  If it wasn't, I would assume it would have

05:37:01  7  saturated or, again, like the other row in 30 and

05:37:05  8  31, it will be an invalid input.

05:37:35  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:37:36 10        Q.  So what is the -- strike that.

05:37:36 11            So the accuracy of the CO sensor is plus

05:37:39 12  or minus 3 percent, isn't it?

05:37:51 13        A.  Yes.  At the calibrated temperature, it

05:37:54 14  would be plus minus 3 percent of the reading.

05:37:58 15        Q.  So this 5999 could be above 6000, isn't

05:38:03 16  it?

05:38:04 17            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,

05:38:06 18  misstates the testimony, vague and ambiguous.

05:38:12 19            THE WITNESS:  Given the plus minus

05:38:14 20  accuracy reading, one would indeed have to consider

05:38:16 21  that it is indeed within that error range, correct.

05:38:21 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:38:21 23        Q.  So it's possible that the value would have

05:38:24 24  been -- could have been above 6000, but it was

05:38:27 25  showing 5999 because it's still within the range of


                                                                258










05:38:31  1  error, the error change of plus or minus 3 percent;

05:38:35  2  is that correct?

05:38:35  3            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

05:38:36  4  incomplete hypothetical.

05:38:37  5            THE WITNESS:  Can you repeat that?

05:38:38  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:38:39  7        Q.  5999 plus or minus 3 percent --

05:38:42  8        A.  Yes.

05:38:42  9        Q.  -- could put it in the 6000 saturated

05:38:46 10  range, isn't it?

05:38:49 11            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

05:38:50 12            THE WITNESS:  No, it's not.  That's

05:38:51 13  something separate.  It doesn't put it in a

05:38:55 14  saturated range; it puts it in -- potentially, the

05:38:59 15  system, the sensor, the instrument itself can have

05:39:02 16  an error up to 5999 plus 3 percent.  It doesn't mean

05:39:09 17  it's sinking and saturating and we're going into

05:39:12 18  that realm of actual operation.  It doesn't mean

05:39:15 19  that at all.

05:39:16 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:39:22 21        Q.  On the next page of that exhibit, there is

05:39:25 22  a graph, Carbon Monoxide (COAF).  Help me understand

05:39:30 23  what you're trying to illustrate in that graph.  It

05:39:35 24  doesn't have any captions for the blue line or the

05:39:42 25  bands.  Help me understand what you're graphing


                                                                259










05:39:45  1  here.

05:39:45  2        A.  Sure.  I'm trying to effectively see,

05:39:51  3  first of all, how the COAF, the peripheral of the

05:39:56  4  COAF, and I'm trying to also determine, given we

05:40:01  5  have Co2 saturating and a situation in the orange of

05:40:09  6  Exhibit 20, the door is open, what I would call a

05:40:17  7  reliable data point that would reflect the internals

05:40:22  8  of the oven as it's operating.

05:40:24  9        Q.  Okay.  Let's take it one piece at a time.

05:40:26 10            What is the X axis?

05:40:29 11        A.  The X axis reflects the -- it reflects the

05:40:35 12  row on Exhibit 20, first page.

05:40:41 13        Q.  So those are the data points?

05:40:43 14        A.  Correct.

05:40:43 15        Q.  And it says 1 through 54 here, but in the

05:40:46 16  data log, it's 0 to 53; is that correct?

05:40:49 17        A.  53.  54 is the end.  I don't think there

05:40:53 18  is a doc page.  That's the end of the range.  So it

05:40:57 19  is data from 0 to 53 as shown in Page 1.

05:41:02 20        Q.  So Number 1 would be 0 on the table?

05:41:14 21        A.  That's a good point.  I'm not sure it's

05:41:16 22  offset by 1.  It shouldn't be.  It should be 0, but

05:41:21 23  it's probably not plotted.

05:41:24 24        Q.  So the bottom line of the X axis is --

05:41:27 25  corresponds to the data points on your table on the


                                                                260










05:41:31  1  previous page?

05:41:31  2        A.  Correct.

05:41:32  3        Q.  And what's the Y axis?

05:41:36  4        A.  The Y axis is COAF, as calculated in this

05:41:42  5  worksheet.

05:41:43  6        Q.  In your worksheet, the COAF is calculated

05:41:50  7  by taking into account the carbon dioxide number,

05:41:53  8  the carbon monoxide number to get a COAF number;

05:41:57  9  right?

05:41:57 10        A.  Yes.

05:41:58 11        Q.  So any inaccuracies in the carbon dioxide

05:42:03 12  number would affect the accuracy of the COAF number;

05:42:08 13  correct?

05:42:08 14        A.  Absolutely.

05:42:09 15        Q.  And any inaccuracies in the CO readings

05:42:13 16  would also affect the accuracy of the COAF number;

05:42:19 17  correct?

05:42:20 18        A.  Correct.

05:42:20 19        Q.  Now, what is the blue line, the trend line

05:42:24 20  in this graph on the second page depicting?

05:42:26 21        A.  The blue line itself?

05:42:28 22        Q.  Yes, the squiggly line.

05:42:30 23        A.  It is the COAF calculations as Rolley

05:42:35 24  (phonetic) calculated with all the data in all the

05:42:40 25  rows.


                                                                261










05:42:40  1        Q.  And what's the blue band on the left-hand

05:42:43  2  side of the graph?

05:42:44  3        A.  The blue band should be -- let's step

05:42:47  4  back.  The orange band reflects the door open, and

05:42:54  5  the blue band, I believe I placed that to reflect

05:43:03  6  invalid, also 140, so basically data that is --

05:43:12  7  effectively cannot be used, given, you know, my call

05:43:17  8  with TSI, at 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

05:43:20  9        Q.  So that is when it's saturated in the

05:43:24 10  temperature readings; is that correct?

05:43:26 11        A.  That's correct.

05:43:26 12        Q.  And what's the blue band on the right-hand

05:43:30 13  side reflecting?

05:43:31 14        A.  Oh, I was referring to the blue band on

05:43:34 15  the right-hand side.

05:43:35 16        Q.  Okay.

05:43:36 17        A.  So what I just mentioned was the blue band

05:43:39 18  on the right-hand side.

05:43:40 19        Q.  And what's the blue band on the left-hand

05:43:51 20  side reflecting?

05:43:52 21        A.  That's reflecting the -- the period where

05:43:59 22  the Co2 has saturated.

05:44:00 23        Q.  And there are no bands -- it looks like a

05:44:21 24  gap between the Y axis and the beginning of the blue

05:44:26 25  band in the -- on the left.


                                                                262










05:44:29  1        A.  That's reflective of the 18 and 19 data in

05:44:35  2  Page 1.

05:44:36  3        Q.  You misunderstood.  I'm talking about

05:44:39  4  1 through 9.

05:44:40  5        A.  1 through 9.  Okay.  What's the question?

05:44:43  6  Sorry.

05:44:43  7        Q.  So the question is:  You don't have any

05:44:46  8  bands or anything there, so does that reflect in

05:44:49  9  your mind the valid data points?

05:44:51 10        A.  No.  I wouldn't consider that being a

05:44:52 11  valid set.

05:44:53 12        Q.  1 through 9?

05:44:55 13        A.  1 through -- it could be 9.  Let me see.

05:44:59 14  Just give me a minute.

05:45:19 15            1 through 9.  So we have 8 and 9 where we

05:45:23 16  have Co2 saturated and we have 7 just before it's

05:45:35 17  saturating with CO at 9.5 and the temperature going

05:45:35 18  from 76 to 77, so now it's increasing.

05:45:46 19            And prior to that, Number 6, we have 3476,

05:45:54 20  5.1 and 76.1.

05:45:56 21            So the question is if it's valid or not?

05:45:59 22  In what sense valid?

05:46:00 23        Q.  I mean are you considering that data to be

05:46:08 24  usable and reliable?

05:46:09 25            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.


                                                                263










05:46:10  1            THE WITNESS:  Yes.

05:46:11  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:46:12  3        Q.  And what about the data in between the

05:46:15  4  open door and the band where the CO is saturated?

05:46:27  5        A.  Band where the CO is saturated?

05:46:30  6        Q.  Co2.  Sorry.

05:46:32  7            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

05:46:33  8            THE WITNESS:  Could you reference the --

05:46:35  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:46:35 10        Q.  In the blue band on the left and the

05:46:38 11  orange band on the right there's a gap.

05:46:40 12        A.  That reflects Row 18 and 19,

05:46:43 13  approximately.

05:46:43 14        Q.  And so that's your valid and usable data?

05:46:46 15        A.  Correct.

05:46:47 16        Q.  And what about the data on the right-hand

05:46:52 17  side of the broad blue band?

05:46:55 18        A.  Again, as I mentioned, the right-hand blue

05:46:59 19  band, I considered that invalid simply because we're

05:47:02 20  reaching --

05:47:03 21        Q.  No, you misunderstood.  I'm talking about

05:47:10 23  band to the right.

05:47:11 24        A.  I didn't consider it to be valid.

05:47:14 25        Q.  So that's not valid data?


                                                                264

05:47:20  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

05:47:20  3        Q.  So the only valid data is in between the

05:47:25  4  orange and the left blue band and left of the left

05:47:28  5  blue band; is that correct?

05:47:30  6            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

05:47:31  7  compound, misstates the prior testimony.

05:47:48  8            THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

05:48:04  9            MR. TAYAB:  Let's go off the record for a

05:48:11 10  second.

05:48:11 11            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.

05:48:12 12  The time is 5:48 p.m.

05:48:12 13            (Whereupon, a recess was held

06:07:03 14            from 5:48 p.m. to 6:07 p.m.)

06:07:03 15            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the

06:07:10 16  record.  The time is 6:07.

06:07:12 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:07:13 18        Q.  Welcome back, Dr. Galatsis.

06:07:16 19        A.  Thank you.

06:07:17 20        Q.  I'm going to refer to Paragraph 20 of your

06:07:22 21  declaration.  In that paragraph, you say:

06:07:27 22                "As such, carbon monoxide

06:07:28 23            concentrations detected within

06:07:31 24            such a flue gas environment

06:07:33 25            (known as as-measured) must be


                                                                265










06:07:35  1            converted to a representative

06:07:37  2            undiluted amount, known as carbon

06:07:41  3            monoxide air-free."

06:07:43  4            Now, what is -- what is carbon monoxide

06:07:47  5  air-free, exactly?

06:07:50  6            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

06:08:02  7            THE WITNESS:  I did indeed give the

06:08:04  8  description prior, but I'll repeat it.

06:08:06  9            It's when one measures carbon monoxide in

06:08:13 10  a flue gas environment using a CO sensor, the CO

06:08:18 11  sensor detects as-measured carbon monoxide in the

06:08:24 12  flue gas environment.  Within that flue gas

06:08:32 13  environment, there is excess air that dilutes the

06:08:38 14  absolute, the real carbon monoxide in that

06:08:41 15  environment, the flue gas environment.

06:08:47 16            So to get to the actual concentration of

06:08:51 17  carbon monoxide in a flue gas environment, one must

06:08:55 18  convert it to carbon monoxide air-free.

06:09:00 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:09:00 20        Q.  So is it an absolute measure of how much

06:09:04 21  carbon monoxide is there in a given mass of air?

06:09:07 22            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:09:09 23  incomplete hypothetical.

06:09:10 24            THE WITNESS:  It's a measurement of carbon

06:09:17 25  monoxide in a specific volume of space in a flue gas


                                                                266










06:09:23  1  environment, given the conditions of the excess air.

06:09:27  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:09:28  3        Q.  Okay.  I am not a combustion engineer, so

06:09:30  4  let me try to ask this in a very simple way through

06:09:33  5  a hypothetical.

06:09:35  6            So I've got a pint of water and I dissolve

06:09:40  7  a tablespoon of sugar in it and I got a pitcher of

06:09:45  8  water, a quart, and I dissolve a teaspoon of sugar

06:09:50  9  in it, is the CO air similar to the teaspoon of

06:09:57 10  sugar?

06:09:57 11            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:09:59 12  incomplete hypothetical.

06:10:03 13            THE WITNESS:  I don't relate what the

06:10:05 14  situation with the COAF is with that analogy at all.

06:10:09 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:10:09 16        Q.  So the pint of water with the teaspoon of

06:10:13 17  sugar in it has a certain concentration of sugar in

06:10:17 18  that pint glass; correct?

06:10:18 19            MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  It's been asked

06:10:22 20  and answered.  He indicated it doesn't make any

06:10:24 21  sense to him, so...

06:10:25 22            THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't understand the

06:10:27 23  analogy with regards to the pint and the sugar given

06:10:32 24  it's a liquid situation, and here we're talking

06:10:36 25  about a flue gas environment.  I don't see the


                                                                267










06:10:38  1  analogy.

06:10:39  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:10:40  3        Q.  Yeah, I'm just trying to understand what

06:10:41  4  COAF is.

06:10:43  5        A.  Sure.

06:10:43  6        Q.  It seems to me that COAF is some measure

06:10:49  7  of concentration of carbon monoxide that is a

06:10:54  8  calculated value to compare two masses of air;

06:11:05  9  correct?

06:11:05 10            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; incomplete

06:11:09 11  hypothetical.

06:11:09 12            THE WITNESS:  I don't describe it that

06:11:11 13  way.

06:11:11 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:11:11 15        Q.  Okay.  It's a complex concept for me.

06:11:14 16            How would you describe what COAF is to a

06:11:18 17  lay jury?

06:11:19 18            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

06:11:20 19            THE WITNESS:  As I mentioned, we have a

06:11:22 20  volume of space.  We have carbon monoxide in that

06:11:25 21  volume of space, such as this room, but in this

06:11:31 22  case, specifically, it's a flue gas situation and we

06:11:35 23  know that there are combustion products in that

06:11:38 24  space of volume.

06:11:40 25            In that space of volume, we have excess


                                                                268










06:11:44  1  air due to the combustion process that could be

06:11:50  2  100 percent.  It could be a thousand percent.  We

06:11:53  3  determine that via an oxygen or Co2 measurement and

06:11:58  4  convert that into the excess air amount, which is

06:12:02  5  dilution factor of the carbon monoxide.  This occurs

06:12:08  6  in a flue gas environment.

06:12:12  7            So the excess air coming from the flue

06:12:17  8  gas, the combustion process, is diluting the carbon

06:12:23  9  monoxide as the sensor sees it.  As the carbon

06:12:28 10  monoxide sensor detects it, it is reducing typically

06:12:32 11  as the excess air is increased.  That is the best

06:12:35 12  way to describe it.

06:12:38 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:12:38 14        Q.  Okay.  And it's a -- it's a calculated

06:12:41 15  value.  It's not a value that is sensed; is that

06:12:46 16  correct?

06:12:46 17            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony,

06:12:48 18  incomplete hypothetical, vague.

06:12:52 19            THE WITNESS:  The COAF is measured using

06:12:56 20  two sensors, and just like any other sensor signal,

06:13:01 21  it undertakes some processing to come up with the

06:13:04 22  value of the COAF.

06:13:07 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:13:07 24        Q.  And is the COAF value limited to a flue

06:13:14 25  gas environment?  You've used that term a few times


                                                                269










06:13:19  1  now.

06:13:19  2        A.  Typically, yes.  Typically, yes.  The COAF

06:13:24  3  is used mostly in a combustion flue gas environment,

06:13:27  4  emissions and others where one wants to extract the

06:13:33  5  real concentration of the carbon monoxide.

06:13:37  6            So if one is undertaking, for example, an

06:13:40  7  emission measurement, one should be using COAF to

06:13:45  8  determine the amount, the absolute amount of carbon

06:13:49  9  monoxide emitted into a certain location coming from

06:13:53 10  a flue gas environment.

06:13:56 11            Similarly, if one is to inhale a pure flue

06:14:01 12  gas volume of space into their lungs, one is

06:14:03 13  inhaling -- one is to calculate and understand the

06:14:07 14  absolute carbon monoxide concentration, not the

06:14:11 15  as-measured CO signal coming from and as-measured CO

06:14:17 16  sensor.

06:14:18 17            One must take into account the absolute

06:14:21 18  amount, and that's exactly what the COAF is meant to

06:14:25 19  do.  It's been designed so that it removes the

06:14:29 20  dilution factor which is coming from the excess air

06:14:31 21  and providing the user or the person adopting this

06:14:35 22  methodology a true, a true sense of the absolute

06:14:41 23  carbon monoxide in that volume of space.

06:14:44 24        Q.  Okay.  But it's applicable only to a flue

06:14:50 25  gas environment?


                                                                270










06:14:51  1            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

06:14:52  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:14:53  3        Q.  Is that correct?

06:14:53  4        A.  Yes.  As I have answered, it is typically

06:14:56  5  used in a combustion analyzer like we have in this

06:15:01  6  case; however, it's also used in emission

06:15:05  7  measurements in other situations where combustion

06:15:10  8  gases exist, such as in mine applications where

06:15:13  9  there's been an explosion, inhalation coming into

06:15:18 10  humans.  One has to determine the absolute amount of

06:15:21 11  carbon monoxide and that then must be evoking a COAF

06:15:26 12  measurement so that one understands again the

06:15:30 13  absolute amount of carbon monoxide, not the

06:15:32 14  measurement coming directly from the sensor.

06:15:36 15        Q.  And is the CO air value reflective of the

06:15:39 16  carbon monoxide being generated at the source of

06:15:42 17  combustion?

06:15:44 18            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:15:46 19  incomplete hypothetical, unintelligible.

06:15:51 20            THE WITNESS:  The COAF measurement is

06:15:54 21  applicable in a flue gas environment where that is

06:16:00 22  being directed, be it in an oven or a small,

06:16:03 23  enclosed location, and one knows that that is indeed

06:16:07 24  a flue gas emission and that there is excess air.

06:16:13  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:16:13  2        Q.  Now, is it a measure of carbon monoxide,

06:16:17  3  let's say, for example, the typical flame?

06:16:20  4            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:16:22  5  incomplete hypothetical.

06:16:24  6            THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase that

06:16:26  7  question, please?

06:16:27  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:16:29  9        Q.  So the COAF value is the absolute amount

06:16:34 10  of carbon monoxide in a given volume of space; is

06:16:39 11  that right?

06:16:39 12        A.  Correct.

06:16:40 13        Q.  And is it reflective of the amount of

06:16:47 14  carbon monoxide generated at a source?

06:16:52 15            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:16:58 16  ambiguous.

06:16:58 17            THE WITNESS:  If, during -- coming from a

06:17:01 18  source to another location there was no additional

06:17:04 19  excess air dilution, then it would be indeed.

06:17:08 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:17:09 21        Q.  And if there is additional dilution, you

06:17:13 22  have to account for that by removing the excess air

06:17:17 23  to get to an apples-to-apples comparison, as you say

06:17:22 24  in your declaration; is that right?

06:17:23 25            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague, incomplete


                                                                272










06:17:25  1  hypothetical.

06:17:25  2            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sort of

06:17:26  3  understanding your question, because in my

06:17:29  4  declaration, mentioning the apples-to-apples

06:17:35  5  comparison is a sense of comparing an ambient

06:17:38  6  situation with a certain carbon monoxide to a COAF

06:17:43  7  situation.

06:17:43  8            So I'm not understanding what your

06:17:45  9  question and how that is superimposed on actually

06:17:48 10  what I have here.

06:17:49 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:17:49 12        Q.  I'm not an expert on this so you'll have

06:17:52 13  to explain it.

06:17:52 14        A.  Sure.

06:17:53 15        Q.  So in Paragraph 20 you say:

06:17:55 16                "This provides an 'apples

06:17:57 17            to apples' basis to compare carbon

06:17:59 18            monoxide measurements in a flue

06:18:01 19            gas environment (such as within

06:18:04 20            the subject oven chamber with a

06:18:06 21            breached heat exchanger) with

06:18:10 22            an indoor 'ambient' air

06:18:12 23            equivalent."

06:18:12 24            So explain that to me, because I don't

06:18:16 25  understand it.


                                                                273










06:18:17  1        A.  Absolutely.  So typically, when -- let's

06:18:21  2  take the OSHA standard of 50 parts per million that

06:18:26  3  is quoted by OSHA as an ambient situation where is

06:18:34  4  at one atmosphere at 25 degrees Celsius, okay?

06:18:37  5            When one inhales flue gases, it's a

06:18:45  6  different situation.  The flue gas is not in one

06:18:49  7  atmosphere, and it's not at a certain temperature as

06:18:55  8  stated or quoted by OSHA.  The parameters are

06:18:58  9  different from that angle.

06:19:00 10            So to take the as-measured, the

06:19:04 11  as-measured sensor display in that inhalation

06:19:10 12  situation would be incorrect, because the absolute

06:19:13 13  amount one is inhaling, knowing it's a flue gas

06:19:17 14  environment, is the COAF, is the absolute amount of

06:19:21 15  carbon monoxide.

06:19:23 16            Therefore, when we are talking about

06:19:27 17  exposure analysis and inhalation and knowingly we

06:19:32 18  are in an ambient environment, fantastic.  One would

06:19:37 19  be using the ambient exposure limit or standard,

06:19:42 20  which is 50 parts per million.

06:19:45 21            When one knowingly is inhaling flue gases,

06:19:51 22  one has to make accommodation for that environment

06:19:55 23  and you fix -- of excess air dilution as measured by

06:20:02 24  the raw CO as-measured sensor coming out, and that

06:20:03 25  has to be compensated for.


                                                                274










06:20:05  1            So to make an apples-to-apples comparison

06:20:09  2  to a standard that takes into consideration one

06:20:12  3  atmosphere at a certain temperature, we also have to

06:20:16  4  understand when one inhales a flue gas environment

06:20:20  5  to take into consideration the dilution effects

06:20:24  6  coming from excess air and use a measure that takes

06:20:29  7  into consideration the absolute amount of carbon

06:20:32  8  monoxide.

06:20:32  9        Q.  And are you saying in a flue gas

06:20:36 10  environment it's not at ambient pressures?

06:20:39 11        A.  In a flue gas environment?

06:20:42 12        Q.  You've mentioned a couple of times --

06:20:43 13        A.  Yes.

06:20:44 14        Q.  -- it's not at ambient --

06:20:46 15        A.  It's not at one atmosphere.

06:20:48 16        Q.  It's not at one atmosphere.

06:20:51 17            And a flue gas environment is -- how

06:20:53 18  different is it from an ambient atmospheric

06:20:59 19  condition?

06:20:59 20        A.  It's higher, and that depends on the

06:21:00 21  excess air.  If we are forcing more excess air which

06:21:04 22  effectively increases the amount of molecules, fresh

06:21:06 23  air molecules to dilute the flue gas, then we are

06:21:11 24  effectively compressing more molecules in the same

06:21:15 25  volume of space, hence, diluting the carbon


                                                                275










06:21:18  1  monoxide.

06:21:18  2        Q.  But you have to enclose that gas in an

06:21:22  3  enclosure to have an increase in pressure; correct?

06:21:26  4        A.  That's correct.

06:21:27  5        Q.  So if you release the flue gas into the

06:21:30  6  environment, there's no pressure differences, is

06:21:33  7  there?

06:21:34  8            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

06:21:35  9  testimony.

06:21:36 10            THE WITNESS:  In a steady state situation

06:21:39 11  as you've described it where one releases a flue gas

06:21:43 12  into a room like we're sitting in, it will dilute

06:21:46 13  and come to a steady state after a certain period of

06:21:50 14  time, after a certain period of time.

06:21:53 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:21:54 16        Q.  Once it's reached a steady state, then it

06:21:56 17  is the ambient CO that is breathed in by a person;

06:22:02 18  isn't that correct?

06:22:02 19        A.  At that point in time in the ambient,

06:22:06 20  that's correct.

06:22:06 21        Q.  Okay.  So if I've got a gas burner and the

06:22:10 22  gas burner is burning in my kitchen and is

06:22:13 23  generating CO at 25 parts per million and I breathe

06:22:19 24  it, I'm breathing in 25 parts per million CO;

06:22:27 25  correct?


                                                                276










06:22:28  1        A.  Can you just clarify what you mean by

06:22:30  2  25 parts per million?  What's measuring 25 parts per

06:22:37  3  million?

06:22:37  4        Q.  I've got a gas burner in my kitchen, and

06:22:40  5  that gas burner -- I stand with a probe about a

06:22:41  6  couple of feet away from it with a Q-Trak a couple

06:22:45  7  of feet away from it, and it gives me a reading of

06:22:48  8  25 parts per million and I got my nose right next to

06:22:48  9  that probe.

06:22:55 10            What am I breathing in?

06:22:56 11        A.  Okay.  Under your scenario, you're in your

06:22:58 12  home in the kitchen and there is a household oven,

06:23:01 13  for example, and it's coming through the range, the

06:23:04 14  emissions from the oven is coming out, and like you

06:23:06 15  mentioned, you're cooking or you're away several

06:23:10 16  feet from emission, in that situation, because there

06:23:14 17  is, given the BTU of a standard oven which is about

06:23:19 18  15, 20 or so thousand, knowing that, knowing once it

06:23:23 19  comes out of that vent, it comes into one atmosphere

06:23:26 20  and you're standing 1 or 2 feet away or 3 feet away

06:23:30 21  from that, then absolutely your indoor air

06:23:36 22  measurement device is measuring the diluted carbon

06:23:39 23  monoxide in that situation.

06:23:41 24            Again, this is in abstract form, but given

06:23:43 25  this scenario, that's correct.  That would be


                                                                277










06:23:45  1  diluted at that point in time.

06:23:48  2        Q.  But if I were to measure the COAF in that

06:23:52  3  situation, I'd get, hypothetically speaking, 200 PPM

06:23:52  4  COAF.

06:23:59  5            That's not what I'm breathing; correct, in

06:24:01  6  that situation?

06:24:02  7            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

06:24:05  8  vague and ambiguous.

06:24:05  9            THE WITNESS:  In that situation, if you're

06:24:07 10  measuring 200 parts per million COAF, and you get a

06:24:14 11  blast of that gas and you inhale that, like

06:24:19 12  Mr. Gumbert has testified, similar to opening the

06:24:23 13  door and getting a blast of whatever it is in that

06:24:27 14  flue gas environment and you inhale that without it

06:24:31 15  being diluted, you will receiving the COAF absolute

06:24:34 16  amount in your system.

06:24:36 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:24:36 18        Q.  So if I assume that I breathe in the air

06:24:36 19  at an atmospheric pressure, then am I breathing in

06:24:42 20  ambient carbon monoxide or am I breathing in

06:24:46 21  air-free carbon monoxide?

06:24:47 22            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered,

06:24:49 23  incomplete hypothetical, vague and ambiguous.

06:24:51 24            THE WITNESS:  I believe I answered that

06:24:52 25  question.  In a scenario where you're stepping 2, 3


                                                                278










06:24:56  1  feet away and where the flue gases coming out of the

06:25:01  2  vent have come to equilibrium steady state, to me,

06:25:07  3  again, that to me would resemble a situation where

06:25:09  4  the carbon monoxide has diluted and you are

06:25:12  5  breathing in the as-measured concentration or carbon

06:25:17  6  monoxide under that scenario.

06:25:18  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:25:19  8        Q.  So it seems to me the variable of

06:25:21  9  importance here is the atmospheric pressure.

06:25:24 10            If I'm breathing in the air at atmospheric

06:25:29 11  pressure, then it's the as-measured.  If I'm

06:25:31 12  breathing in the air at something greater than the

06:25:35 13  atmospheric pressure, then I'm breathing in COAF.

06:25:42 14            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

06:25:42 15  misstates the testimony.

06:25:43 16            THE WITNESS:  I find that incomplete.  I

06:25:46 17  find that if we have a volume of space, we know that

06:25:49 18  it has come from a flue gas environment -- it is CO,

06:25:53 19  it is CO -- and it is under some pressure due to the

06:26:01 20  combustion process and one inhales that volume of

06:26:06 21  space, then the COAF will be applicable.

06:26:10 22            Again, that would be told by the

06:26:13 23  instrument if there is COAF present and there's

06:26:17 24  excess air present.

06:26:18 25  ///


                                                                279










06:26:18  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:26:19  2        Q.  Now, why don't the probes that measure

06:26:22  3  COAF also have a pressure sensor in them?

06:26:28  4        A.  Why don't they?

06:26:29  5        Q.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that make logical sense?

06:26:32  6  Because you're saying that if it's at one

06:26:34  7  atmosphere, then if I breathe in that flue gas, it

06:26:36  8  is the as-measured concentration, but if it's at

06:26:40  9  something greater than one atmosphere, then I'm

06:26:43 10  breathing in COAF.

06:26:45 11            So why wouldn't a probe have a pressure

06:26:49 12  sensor in it?

06:26:50 13            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,

06:26:52 14  vague and ambiguous.

06:26:52 15            THE WITNESS:  Again, I haven't thought

06:26:53 16  about this, but a pressure differential, if we have

06:26:59 17  excess air with regards to its composition of oxygen

06:27:07 18  or Co2, given it's molecular weight and density,

06:27:09 19  would probably give a sensor some -- the pressure

06:27:13 20  sensor, that is, some issue.

06:27:13 21            So in the case of a COAF measurement --

06:27:17 22  again, I'm assuming this -- it would seem to me that

06:27:20 23  we would be in a better situation to handle the

06:27:25 24  excess air calculation using a specific o2

06:27:30 25  calculation Co2.


                                                                280










06:27:41  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:27:41  2        Q.  Okay.  So you said if there is elevated

06:27:44  3  pressure and I breathe in flue gas, then I use a

06:27:50  4  COAF measurement.

06:27:52  5            Now, exactly at what point do I not use a

06:27:55  6  COAF measurement and use an ambient CO measurement

06:28:00  7  when I'm breathing in flue gases?

06:28:03  8            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

06:28:04  9  vague.

06:28:05 10            THE WITNESS:  The COAF is calculated based

06:28:12 11  on excess air.  If we know we have a flue gas

06:28:17 12  environment and excess air, one should be

06:28:19 13  calculating the COAF.

06:28:26 14            Various instruments discriminate at what

06:28:29 15  point the COAF is relevant.  I believe for the Testo

06:28:33 16  instrument, it's at 20 percent oxygen; others, it is

06:28:40 17  a little less than 19 percent, 18 percent.

06:28:50 18            So I know that different instruments

06:28:51 19  consider COAF reading at different points or

06:28:56 20  different Co2 levels also, but if one knows that

06:29:00 21  there is a depletion of oxygen and it's a flue gas

06:29:05 22  environment, then there's full confidence to be

06:29:08 23  using the COAF measurement.

06:29:11 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:29:11 25        Q.  Until a certain threshold, say, for


                                                                281










06:29:15  1  example, 18 percent for certain types of sensors.

06:29:18  2            If it's beyond that, the COAF number would

06:29:20  3  be hyperinflated; is that correct?

06:29:23  4            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstates the

06:29:24  5  testimony, asked and answered.

06:29:25  6            THE WITNESS:  I disagree with that.

06:29:29  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:29:29  8        Q.  So the concentration of oxygen in the

06:29:34  9  atmosphere is about 20.9 percent, isn't it?

06:29:34 10        A.  Correct.

06:29:38 11        Q.  So if I have about 20.8 percent in the

06:29:40 12  atmosphere and I try to measure the COAF number,

06:29:43 13  that would be a hyperinflated number, isn't it?

06:29:46 14            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:29:47 15  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, misstates the

06:29:50 16  testimony.

06:29:50 17            THE WITNESS:  If you know for certain you

06:29:53 18  have a flue gas environment and you have such a

06:29:55 19  massive excess air coming in at 20.8 and you're

06:29:59 20  taking a measurement and you know for certain that

06:30:03 21  is a flue gas environment and you have a combustion

06:30:06 22  talking place and the excess air is indeed diluting

06:30:11 23  it, then the dilution factor is very large.

06:30:15 24  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:30:15 25        Q.  And so the COAF is not reliable in that


                                                                282










06:30:19  1  situation; is that correct?

06:30:20  2            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

06:30:22  3            THE WITNESS:  Again, the COAF will be

06:30:28  4  extremely large.  If there is a flue gas environment

06:30:31  5  and we talk about excess air as a very large factor,

06:30:36  6  then you have very, very large amount of dilution

06:30:40  7  going on.

06:30:41  8            And let me add, also, I haven't seen a

06:30:45  9  situation like that.

06:30:46 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:30:47 11        Q.  Now, the measurement that was taken on the

06:30:50 12  Testo on September 21st, I believe it had an excess

06:30:55 13  air percentage of about 74 point something percent?

06:31:01 14        A.  Can you reference that?  Can you show me

06:31:03 15  that, please?

06:31:04 16            MS. GARRISON:  The folder right there.

06:31:04 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:31:06 18        Q.  It's the folder right there.

06:31:06 19        A.  I didn't see 74; I saw 764.

06:31:10 20        Q.  Isn't that 76.44 percent?

06:31:12 21        A.  76.4.

06:31:17 22        Q.  What do you understand that number to

06:31:21 23  mean?

06:31:21 24        A.  I understand this number to mean

06:31:22 25  764 percent excess air.


                                                                283










06:31:25  1        Q.  Oh, that's 764 percent.  Okay.

06:31:29  2            And so is that a very large percentage of

06:31:32  3  dilution air in there?

06:31:35  4        A.  That is relative.  That is relative.  It

06:31:40  5  depends on the combustion process.  It depends on

06:31:42  6  the scenario.  So I can't comment.  I can't answer

06:31:46  7  that question.

06:31:48  8        Q.  So when you're burning natural gas, the

06:31:58  9  appliances, there's a certain volume of air that's

06:32:02 10  necessary for complete combustion; isn't that

06:32:05 11  correct?

06:32:05 12        A.  Correct.

06:32:06 13        Q.  And appliance designers tend to use a

06:32:11 14  certain amount of excess air to ensure complete

06:32:15 15  combustion; isn't that correct?

06:32:17 16            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:32:18 17  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.

06:32:28 18            THE WITNESS:  Again, I haven't spoken with

06:32:28 19  these designers and that's what they do.  I don't

06:32:28 20  know if you have, but I haven't heard that testimony

06:32:29 21  from --

06:32:31 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:32:31 23        Q.  So, for example, the Karg article says,

06:32:33 24  know, that you could have 1 1/2 times stoichiometric

06:32:42 25  air to ensure complete combustion; isn't that right?


                                                                284










06:32:43  1            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; incomplete

06:32:44  2  hypothetical, vague.

06:32:45  3            THE WITNESS:  So if that's what's in that

06:32:46  4  article, that's what's in that article.  Okay.

06:32:48  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:32:49  6        Q.  Okay.  So here you've got 764 percent

06:32:57  7  excess air.

06:32:57  8            Isn't that an extremely high amount of

06:32:58  9  excess air to be an example?

06:32:58 10            MR. JARCHI:  It's been asked and answered

06:33:01 11  two or three times now.

06:33:01 12            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'll have to repeat

06:33:02 13  what I've said.  It depends on the context.

06:33:04 14            And we all know that given various data

06:33:08 15  points, if somebody's not behaving normal -- and

06:33:12 16  again, for me to generalize in answering that

06:33:15 17  question, it would depend on the appliance, the

06:33:17 18  scenario and the situation.

06:33:20 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:33:29 20        Q.  Now, is COAF primarily used as a means to

06:33:31 21  compare the carbon monoxide generated between two

06:33:35 22  similar appliances?

06:33:37 23            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

06:33:39 24  argumentative.

06:33:50 25            THE WITNESS:  Two similar appliances.


                                                                285










06:33:50  1  I've never read that description until I read the

06:33:54  2  declarations of Renee and Barrera.

06:34:19  3            MR. TAYAB:  Let's stop for a second.

06:34:20  4            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.

06:34:22  5  The time is 6:34 p.m.

06:34:22  6            (Whereupon, there was a brief pause.

06:35:43  7            In the proceedings.)

06:35:43  8            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the

06:35:44  9  record.  The time is 6:35 p.m.

06:35:50 10            MR. TAYAB:  Dr. Galatsis, before we took

06:35:51 11  the break, I was asking a question on whether COAF

06:36:00 12  is used to compare two different devices to measure

06:36:01 13  as a measure for carbon monoxide generated by those

06:36:03 14  two devices.

06:36:04 15            And I've handed you an article by Karg

06:36:08 16  marked Exhibit 25.

06:36:08 17            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 25was

06:36:08 18            marked for identification by the

06:36:08 19            deposition reporter and is attached

06:36:08 20            hereto.)

06:36:10 21            MR. TAYAB:  If you'll flip to the second

06:36:12 22  page and see the diagram of an A and B, that's

06:36:17 23  essentially what I was trying to unartfully

06:36:22 24  articulate.  So if you'll take a moment to look at

06:36:31 25  that section of the article.


                                                                286










06:36:31  1            (Document reviewed by witness.)

06:36:35  2            THE WITNESS:  Okay.

06:36:35  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:36:35  4        Q.  Okay.  So it says Oven A, there's a large

06:36:41  5  excess of air being pumped in through that oven, and

06:36:45  6  the as-measured value is 18 PPM, the oxygen is at

06:36:49  7  20, and the air-free carbon monoxide is 400.

06:36:53  8            And at the second oven, the as-measured is

06:36:57  9  209, but very little air is being pumped through

06:37:01 10  that oven, so the as-measured is -- orders a

06:37:05 11  magnitude higher than Oven A.

06:37:08 12            And the point I think the article is

06:37:10 13  making is that this is a mistake; that both of these

06:37:14 14  ovens generate -- have a calculated COAF value that

06:37:21 15  is exactly the same, which is 400 parts per million.

06:37:25 16  That's what I'm paraphrasing the article to say.

06:37:29 17            So I'm understanding that article to

06:37:31 18  communicate that he used the COAF value to compare

06:37:35 19  two devices.

06:37:36 20            Is that a use of COAF measurements?

06:37:40 21            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, incomplete

06:37:44 22  hypothetical, vague, form.

06:37:47 23            THE WITNESS:  No, it's not.  The purpose

06:37:50 24  of this illustration by Karg is to demonstrate, as

06:37:57 25  he mentions here, the inherent problem with


                                                                287










06:38:01  1  as-measured values.

06:38:01  2            He's actually -- this part of his article

06:38:04  3  is summarizing for me what I've been describing the

06:38:08  4  past 20 minutes, very eloquently, why one should not

06:38:12  5  be using as-measured in a situation like this,

06:38:16  6  because large errors can be made.

06:38:20  7            In this situation specifically in this

06:38:23  8  article, he places these Ovens A and B as an example

06:38:28  9  to show the reader the problem, again as he says the

06:38:33 10  inherent problem with as-measured values.

06:38:37 11            It isn't typical to use COAF specifically

06:38:41 12  to compare Appliance A and Appliance B in industry.

06:38:46 13  I've never seen that done as you stated previously.

06:38:54 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:38:54 15        Q.  Okay.  But this is used to determine what

06:39:01 16  the source strength of CO is in Oven A and Oven B,

06:39:09 17  and that is exactly equal to both ovens in this

06:39:11 18  hypothetical, isn't it?

06:39:12 19            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:39:13 20  incomplete hypothetical.

06:39:13 21            THE WITNESS:  That's another way of

06:39:15 22  putting it.  I would agree with that.  And again,

06:39:18 23  he's illustrating this with examples and again, the

06:39:24 24  purpose of doing that isn't to compare the actual

06:39:27 25  oven; it's to present and explain the importance of


                                                                288










06:39:30  1  understanding COAF and the inherent problem with the

06:39:35  2  as-measured value.  So that is the purpose of him

06:39:41  3  illustrating two ovens side by side.

06:39:45  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:39:46  5        Q.  And so this COAF value is a value that is

06:39:52  6  backing out the oxygen in that volume of air;

06:39:56  7  correct?

06:39:57  8            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:39:58  9  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, misstates the

06:40:00 10  prior testimony.

06:40:01 11            THE WITNESS:  Backing out the excess air,

06:40:04 12  correct.

06:40:04 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:40:05 14        Q.  Now -- and that's a calculated value.

06:40:11 15  You've got the real gas, and then you take away the

06:40:16 16  excess air and you get the COAF value; correct?

06:40:20 17            MR. JARCHI:  Objection --

06:40:21 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:40:22 19        Q.  It is a calculated quantity.

06:40:25 20            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,

06:40:28 21  vague and ambiguous, form.

06:40:29 22            THE WITNESS:  All measurements are

06:40:32 23  calculated in some shape, way or form.  And it

06:40:33 24  depends what you mean by calculated.

06:40:36 25            We have two sensors providing signals


                                                                289










06:40:41  1  inferring an absolute quantity of carbon monoxide,

06:40:49  2  and that's how we obtain it.

06:40:53  3            Are there calculations required to get to

06:40:55  4  that value?  Absolutely.  Like there are

06:40:59  5  calculations to obtain the as-measured CO that the

06:41:03  6  monitor is presenting us.

06:41:05  7            There are numerous calculations that go

06:41:07  8  into that based on its calibration history or the

06:41:12  9  coefficients that go with that, et cetera,

06:41:13 10  et cetera, et cetera.

06:41:14 11            So when you tell me that's a calculated

06:41:17 12  value, actually pretty much every signal coming from

06:41:22 13  a sensor in an instrument that's a microprocessor,

06:41:26 14  there are calculations taking place to derive what

06:41:28 15  one sees.

06:41:28 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:41:29 17        Q.  But that's different, isn't it.  Based on

06:41:31 18  using an electrochemical sensor, for example, it is

06:41:34 19  differences in voltages that it's calculating.

06:41:37 20            But it's really sensing the absolute

06:41:39 21  concentration of a molecule in a given volume of

06:41:43 22  gas; isn't that correct?

06:41:45 23            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative and misstates

06:41:46 24  the testimony.

06:41:48 25            THE WITNESS:  What is -- what is --


                                                                290










06:41:48  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:41:49  2        Q.  Say, for example, you're measuring

06:41:51  3  molecules of carbon monoxide in an electrochemical

06:41:54  4  sensor, and depending upon the concentration,

06:41:57  5  perhaps the voltages are different and it has to

06:42:01  6  calculate those voltages to give you a number.

06:42:05  7            Are those the calculations that you're

06:42:07  8  talking about?

06:42:07  9            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

06:42:08 10            THE WITNESS:  As I've described, a sensor

06:42:13 11  doesn't have a hand and pick the molecules and count

06:42:17 12  them in a space.  There are calculations and

06:42:22 13  processes and protocols that are in software that go

06:42:25 14  behind the ultimate value that the detector is

06:42:28 15  providing.

06:42:30 16            Again, as I said, calculations are taking

06:42:32 17  place to present you with that as-measured value,

06:42:35 18  for example, from carbon monoxide.

06:42:37 19            One takes those from carbon monoxide as

06:42:40 20  measured, one takes the excess air as measured from

06:42:46 21  o2 2 and we place it in the COAF format and it is

06:42:53 22  presented to the user.

06:42:55 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:42:55 24        Q.  Now, for a combustion source that's

06:42:59 25  generating carbon monoxide and to have a COAF value,


                                                                291










06:43:07  1  where would I need to put my nose to breathe that

06:43:10  2  COAF value?

06:43:12  3            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:43:13  4  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.

06:43:16  5            Let's go off the record for a second.

06:43:19  6            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Sure.  Going off the

06:43:20  7  record.  The time is 6:43 p.m.

06:43:20  8            (Whereupon, there was a brief

06:43:20  9            pause in the proceedings.)

06:43:56 10            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the

06:43:57 11  record.  The time is 6:44 p.m.

         12            MR. TAYAB:  Could you please read back the

         13  question.

         14            (The record was read as follows:

         15            Q.   Now, for a combustion source

         16            that's generating carbon monoxide

         17            and to have a COAF value, where

         18            would I need to put my nose to

06:44:17 19            breathe that COAF value?)

06:44:17 20            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:44:18 21  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.

06:44:21 22            THE WITNESS:  So I understand the question

06:44:25 23  as we have a flue gas, we have an environment.

06:44:34 24  Again, we could be specific and take the situation

06:44:37 25  of an oven bake chamber.  We know flue gases are


                                                                292










06:44:43  1  entering the chamber in large amounts, large amounts

06:44:50  2  where we have a combustion analyzer presenting COAF,

06:44:59  3  measuring carbon monoxide depletion of oxygen, and I

06:45:02  4  understand the question to be where must I be to

06:45:07  5  inhale that flue gas.

06:45:12  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:45:13  7        Q.  To breathe in a carbon monoxide level as

06:45:16  8  represented by the COAF value.

06:45:19  9        A.  You need to be in the flue gas environment

06:45:23 10  or somewhere where it has not diluted.

06:45:28 11        Q.  Okay.

06:45:28 12        A.  And per the testimony, again, of

06:45:32 13  Mr. Gumbert and ITW, that would reflect a situation

06:45:36 14  where one opens the door and gets a blast of

06:45:41 15  whatever is in the cavity of a bake oven such as a

06:45:46 16  DRO2G.

06:45:47 17        Q.  And in your view, the plaintiffs in this

06:45:49 18  case were directly breathing the flue gas

06:45:52 19  environment when they opened the door?

06:45:53 20        A.  Again, based on testimony from Mr. Gumbert

06:45:57 21  and based on testimony from the plaintiffs that

06:46:00 22  opened the door numerous times during a bake cycle

06:46:03 23  or during their work period, the -- yes, the answer

06:46:10 24  is yes, absolutely.  And again, I'm relying on

06:46:13 25  Mr. Gumbert and -- on Mr. Gumbert in understanding


                                                                293










06:46:19  1  that situation.

06:46:21  2        Q.  Now, with the subject oven, when an

06:46:27  3  individual opens the door of the subject oven, do

06:46:32  4  they -- would they use the door as a shield because

06:46:37  5  of the hot gases coming out, or would they stick

06:46:40  6  their faces into the hot gas as it's coming out?

06:46:43  7            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

06:46:44  8            THE WITNESS:  I haven't read any testimony

06:46:47  9  that they're using the door as a shield, nor have I

06:46:53 10  heard Mr. Gumbert describe it like that.  I

06:46:57 11  understand it as they are trying to work in an sense

06:47:01 12  of urgency in a bakery scenario.  They want to move

06:47:03 13  the product as fast as possible, they're opening the

06:47:06 14  door, and again, per Gumbert's testimony, they're

06:47:09 15  getting a blast of whatever is in the oven cavity.

06:47:13 16        Q.  So in your view, when they open the door,

06:47:15 17  it's the inside air at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  When

06:47:19 18  they open the door, 400 degrees Fahrenheit of air

06:47:24 19  gets into their breathable zone is what you're

06:47:26 20  saying?

06:47:26 21        A.  I am saying what Mr. Gumbert is saying.

06:47:28 22        Q.  No, I'm asking you.  As an expert, I'm

06:47:31 23  asking you.

06:47:31 24        A.  I'm not an expert in using a bake oven.

06:47:35 25  I've never used a DRO2G.  I've never used a


                                                                294










06:47:40  1  commercial oven myself, so I rely on the testimony

06:47:43  2  of ITW.

06:47:47  3        Q.  And you have no view one way or the other

06:47:50  4  that if you open up the oven door, whether gas at

06:47:56  5  400 degrees Fahrenheit inside the oven would

06:47:59  6  directly get into the breathable zone of the person

06:48:04  7  opening the oven?

06:48:05  8            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony.

06:48:08  9            THE WITNESS:  Again, opening my barbecue,

06:48:12 10  I get a blast of smoke.  Opening my oven at home, I

06:48:17 11  get a blast of whatever's in the cavity.

06:48:22 12            In line with Mr. Gumbert's testimony

06:48:25 13  again, whatever is in the oven cavity, in that

06:48:27 14  situation, specifically for the DRO2G, the folks

06:48:28 15  would be getting a blast of whatever is in the bake

06:48:31 16  chamber, per his testimony.

06:48:33 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:48:33 18        Q.  Well, we've talked about OSHA a couple of

06:48:35 19  times and the 50 PPM time weighted average standard

06:48:40 20  for eight hours.

06:48:41 21            Now, is that 50 PPM standard based on an

06:48:45 22  ambient CO measurement or a COAF measurement?

06:48:49 23            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

06:48:53 24            THE WITNESS:  OSHA specifically has two

06:48:58 25  columns on their table.  It is a PPM, which is


                                                                295










06:49:03  1  50 parts per million, and it is another column,

06:49:08  2  milligram per cubic meter, a volumetric standard

06:49:15  3  which is 55 milligrams per cubic meter.

06:49:23  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:49:24  5        Q.  Okay.  And 55 milligrams per cubic meter

06:49:30  6  of carbon monoxide; right?

06:49:31  7        A.  Of carbon monoxide.

06:49:34  8        Q.  And what is that in parts per million?

06:49:40  9        A.  It's 55 per million at one atmosphere at

06:49:45 10  room temperature.

06:49:46 11        Q.  Correct.  So what's the difference between

06:49:48 12  the two numbers?

06:49:49 13        A.  One is parts per million at ambient; the

06:49:53 14  other is purely volumetric, milligram per cubic

06:49:57 15  meter.

06:49:57 16        Q.  Well, parts per million is volumetric,

06:50:01 17  too, isn't it?

06:50:02 18            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

06:50:04 19            THE WITNESS:  It's parts per million.

06:50:07 20  There's no volumetric --

06:50:07 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:50:08 22        Q.  Well, help me understand what the

06:50:09 23  difference parts per million and volumetric is.

06:50:12 24            What's the essential difference between

06:50:14 25  the two?


                                                                296










06:50:14  1            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered

06:50:17  2  repeatedly.

06:50:18  3            THE WITNESS:  The essential difference is

06:50:18  4  the definition of the unit that we're discussing,

06:50:18  5  parts per million.  And the other definition that

06:50:27  6  we're discussing is milligram, which is an absolute

06:50:29  7  amount of weight of a certain specific gas -- which

06:50:29  8  in this case we're talking about carbon monoxide --

06:50:29  9  normalized over a set volume of space, which also --

06:50:30 10  you know, a volume of space guess would represent

06:50:41 11  the absolute amount of, in this case again, carbon

06:50:46 12  monoxide in grams in a volume of space.

06:50:48 13  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:50:48 14        Q.  So are you saying mg per meter cube is

06:50:54 15  analogous to COAF?

06:50:56 16        A.  If both are at the same one atmosphere

06:51:00 17  ambient, yes.

06:51:01 18        Q.  So it is essentially -- what you're saying

06:51:05 19  is if it's at one atmosphere, the OSHA standard is

06:51:08 20  55 PPM COAF.

06:51:11 21            Is what you're saying?

06:51:13 22        A.  Can you rephrase the question?

06:51:19 23        Q.  You said earlier that the mg per meter

06:51:21 24  cube value is analogous to a COAF value as long as

06:51:25 25  it is at one atmosphere.


                                                                297










06:51:29  1        A.  At 55.  That's correct.  That's correct.

06:51:32  2        Q.  So at one atmosphere, is 55 mg per meter

06:51:38  3  cube carbon monoxide the same as 55 PPM COAF?

06:51:42  4        A.  Did you say 55 parts per million is the

06:51:46  5  same as --

06:51:47  6        Q.  No.  55 parts per million COAF,

06:51:51  7  is it the same as 55 mg per cubic meter at one

06:51:56  8  atmosphere?

06:51:57  9            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:51:58 10  incomplete hypothetical.

06:51:58 11            THE WITNESS:  At one atmosphere.

06:52:05 12            There would be no COAF at one atmosphere.

06:52:15 13  You're assuming it's an ambient, so that would not

06:52:18 14  exist.

06:52:18 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:52:19 16        Q.  Okay.  So if it's a COAF number, it has to

06:52:23 17  be at a pressure that's different from one

06:52:25 18  atmosphere, is what I understand you to testify.

06:52:29 19        A.  Okay.  My testimony is that if you look at

06:52:32 20  the 55 milligram per cubic meter, which is a

06:52:37 21  volumetric requirement from OSHA, there is no

06:52:41 22  specification of atmosphere.  It's an absolute

06:52:46 23  amount.  Similarly, COAF is an absolute amount.

06:52:50 24        Q.  Okay.  So COAF is one way to measure an

06:52:54 25  absolute amount and mg per meter cube is another way


                                                                298










06:52:59  1  of measuring an absolute amount, but are they

06:53:02  2  analogous?  I think you said they were.

06:53:05  3            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

06:53:06  4            THE WITNESS:  They are indeed analogous,

06:53:09  5  but not in the -- I think you were trying to

06:53:17  6  reference a conversion previously which I have to

06:53:20  7  calculate and think about.  So I cannot agree on

06:53:23  8  what you asked me previously.

06:53:25  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:53:30 10        Q.  No.  What I was originally asking is if

06:53:32 11  the 50 PPM OSHA level time weighted average, is the

06:53:40 12  50 PPM ambient or 50 PPM, or is it based on COAF?

06:53:44 13            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

06:53:46 14  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.

06:53:46 15            THE WITNESS:  The OSHA 50 parts per

06:53:49 16  million is based on one atmosphere at 25 degrees

06:53:54 17  Celsius.

06:53:54 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:53:55 19        Q.  But ambient CO?

06:53:56 20        A.  That's what --

06:53:57 21            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

06:53:59 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:53:59 23        Q.  Is there any regulation that you're aware

06:54:04 24  of that uses COAF as the basis for a carbon monoxide

06:54:10 25  concentration?


                                                                299










06:54:12  1        A.  Yes, there is.  There is the technical

06:54:16  2  service bulletin --

06:54:19  3            MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  Let him finish his

06:54:21  4  answer.  Hold on.  Let him finish his answer.

06:54:24  5            THE WITNESS:  There is a technical service

06:54:26  6  bulletin that was published in 2005, I believe, by

06:54:30  7  ITW that requires 50 parts per million COAF in the

06:54:37  8  bake chamber, and I believe they use that as

06:54:42  9  their -- as their limit of some type to determine --

06:54:47 10  again, I don't know what adjective they were using,

06:54:51 11  but a defective or compromised heat exchange

06:54:55 12  knowingly, knowing that there were employees using

06:55:00 13  the bake oven and if one was to open the door, that

06:55:09 14  again, according to Gumbert's testimony, they would

06:55:11 15  be receiving that internal CO value, that COAF value

06:55:15 16  which Mr. Gumbert transposed the 50 parts per minute

06:55:19 17  from OSHA into his TSB.

06:55:22 18        Q.  The TSB is not a regulation, is it?

06:55:25 19        A.  It is a requirement.

06:55:27 20        Q.  But I specifically asked:  Are you aware

06:55:30 21  of any regulations that are based on COAF values for

06:55:37 22  the limit for carbon monoxide?

06:55:39 23            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

06:55:40 24            THE WITNESS:  For the limit for carbon

06:55:50 25  monoxide of emissions, there is the Z21.1.


                                                                300










06:55:53  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:55:53  2        Q.  And what's the Z21.1?

06:55:55  3        A.  That is the flue definitions of various

06:55:58  4  appliances.

06:55:58  5        Q.  Okay.  That's an ANSI standard, isn't it?

06:56:03  6        A.  That is an ANSI standard.

06:56:06  7        Q.  Now, what's the purpose of that standard?

06:56:08  8        A.  I believe the purpose of that standard is

06:56:09  9  to provide an upper ceiling of emissions of carbon

06:56:18 10  monoxide in COAF, again having historical --

06:56:22 11  historical roots from a health toxicology

06:56:27 12  perspective.

06:56:28 13        Q.  Okay.  But that is about 800 PPM COAF;

06:56:33 14  correct?

06:56:33 15        A.  For commercial ovens, I believe so, yes.

06:56:36 16        Q.  For commercial ovens.

06:56:36 17            But that's for the certification on the

06:56:39 18  ovens, isn't it?

06:56:40 19            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

06:56:43 20            THE WITNESS:  I don't know if it's for the

06:56:46 21  certification or not, but that regulation stems from

06:56:54 22  a situation where if the emission of the flue gas

06:56:59 23  comes back into an ambient environment, a workplace,

06:57:02 24  a home, that there would be a certain amount of

06:57:07 25  carbon monoxide in the ambient over a certain period


                                                                301










06:57:10  1  of time.  That is the historical origins of the

06:57:16  2  Z21.1 COAF.  So they have placed a ceiling limit of

06:57:21  3  what the emissions should be if, God forbid, there

06:57:27  4  is a situation like a breached heat exchange and

06:57:31  5  others.

06:57:34  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:57:34  7        Q.  Any other regulations you can think of?

06:57:37  8            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

06:57:38  9  incomplete hypothetical.

06:57:46 10            THE WITNESS:  That covers it for now.

06:57:47 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:58:31 12        Q.  Dr. Galatsis, you made a number of

06:58:33 13  calculations with respect to the total weighted

06:58:36 14  average carbon monoxide levels that each of the

06:58:40 15  plaintiffs were exposed to, did you not?

06:58:43 16        A.  I did.

06:58:44 17            MR. TAYAB:  Let me hand you Exhibit 26.

         18            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 26 was

         19            marked for identification by the

         20            deposition reporter and is attached

         21            hereto.)

         22  BY MR. TAYAB:

06:58:48 23        Q.  Will you identify that for the record,

06:58:52 24  please.

06:58:52 25        A.  This is Exhibit 26 titled Exposures.  It's


                                                                302










06:58:57  1  a table with the various names, I believe mostly in

06:59:05  2  this case of the plaintiffs, and with a column noted

06:59:12  3  denoted as Door Open Per Day, a column denoted as

06:59:14  4  Hours within 13 feet, and TWA, which stands for time

06:59:19  5  weighted average.

06:59:26  6        Q.  I want to understand how you came up with

06:59:28  7  the calculations for the time weighted average, so

06:59:31  8  help me with those calculations.  I really want you

06:59:34  9  to walk me through exactly how you calculated the

06:59:37 10  numbers on the fourth column, okay?  So if you'll

06:59:41 11  help me understand how you came up with those

06:59:43 12  calculations.

06:59:43 13            Let's talk about Lafayette Wallace.

06:59:50 14            So how did you arrive at 18 to 53 PPM for

06:59:54 15  8 hours time weighted average?

06:59:56 16        A.  So the way I calculated it for Lafayette

07:00:01 17  Wallace is similar to the other -- I believe four

07:00:03 18  plaintiffs here.  So the framework is as follows.

07:00:18 19            Within 13 feet of the oven, we know that

07:00:19 20  the CO detector was alarming, was the first thing.

07:00:19 21        Q.  So that's your first presumption, that

07:00:20 22  within 13 feet of the oven, the CO alarm was

07:00:21 23  alarming because it detected carbon monoxide?

07:00:25 24        A.  It's not an assumption; it's a fact.  It

07:00:29 25  was continuously alarming.


                                                                303










07:00:30  1        Q.  Okay.  We'll get to that.  That's a

07:00:32  2  separate line of questioning.

07:00:34  3            For purposes of this calculation, it's an

07:00:36  4  assumption that the alarm went off within 13 feet.

07:00:40  5            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative and

07:00:41  6  it's been asked and answered as phrased.

07:00:45  7            THE WITNESS:  The minimum possible alarm

07:00:49  8  level for a CO detector, as you know, is 70 parts

07:00:53  9  per million.

07:00:54 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:00:55 11        Q.  Yeah, we'll get to that.

07:00:56 12        A.  That's part of the framework.  You asked

07:00:59 13  me a question.  I'm trying to answer it.

07:01:00 14        Q.  Okay.  Go ahead.

07:01:02 15        A.  Knowing that it's 70 parts per million,

07:01:05 16  knowing that the minimum we require to trigger the

07:01:08 17  CO detector, I have conservatively used the 70.  It

07:01:13 18  could be above that.  I don't know.  But I do know

07:01:16 19  that the CO detector alarms at 70 part per million.

07:01:20 20        Q.  Ambient levels?

07:01:22 21        A.  At ambient within a bakery environment.

07:01:26 22            In addition to that, we have declarations

07:01:29 23  from the plaintiffs that describe to me the hours

07:01:35 24  they were within 13 feet of the oven, and also we

07:01:40 25  have times, how many times per day they are opening


                                                                304










07:01:44  1  the subject oven door.

07:01:48  2            So knowing that they are exposed --

07:01:53  3  potentially exposed to carbon monoxide, enough to

07:01:58  4  treat it as CO detector at 70 parts per million,

07:02:01  5  knowing that they are within 13 feet of the oven, I

07:02:07  6  take a simple calculation, a time weighted average.

07:02:11  7  So two hours is --

07:02:17  8        Q.  Could you write your calculation down so I

07:02:19  9  can follow along.

07:02:21 10        A.  Sure, absolutely.

07:02:24 11        Q.  On the exhibit itself.

07:02:26 12        A.  Okay.

07:02:27 13        Q.  So this is for Wallace.

07:02:29 14        A.  Wallace.  Correct.

07:02:32 15        Q.  So could you write the name Wallace and do

07:02:35 16  your calculation under that.

07:02:37 17        A.  So, for example, for Wallace, we have two

07:02:42 18  hours at the minimum, two hours as a fraction of the

07:02:57 19  total 8 hours, so 2 over 8 times 70 parts per

07:03:01 20  million would be the time weighted average at two

07:03:04 21  hours.  I don't have a calculator with me.

07:03:16 22        Q.  And you know you can flip it to make it

07:03:21 23  scientific.

07:03:34 24            (Whereupon, a discussion was held

07:03:34 25            off the stenographic record.)


                                                                305










07:03:38  1            THE WITNESS:  So the Wallace equation is a

07:03:39  2  fraction of the eight hours.  2 out of 8 times 70

07:03:43  3  parts per million is 17.5 rounded up to 18 to keep

07:03:48  4  whole numbers.

07:03:52  5            So again, it's a basic time weighted

07:03:54  6  average calculation where one takes the fraction of

07:03:58  7  the eight hours, which is hours over the total time,

07:04:01  8  which is eight in this case for OSHA, and we

07:04:05  9  multiply that by the exposure level that we are

07:04:09 10  employing.  In this case, it is the first alarm

07:04:12 11  triggered at 70 parts per million.  And when one

07:04:17 12  multiplies these two numbers, one obtains the time

07:04:20 13  weighted average.  In this case, it's 18 parts per

07:04:24 14  million.

07:04:24 15        Q.  So your assumption is for the entire

07:04:26 16  duration of the two hours that the employee claims

07:04:30 17  that they were within the 13 feet, they were exposed

07:04:34 18  to 70 parts per million ambient carbon monoxide

07:04:39 19  levels --

07:04:39 20        A.  It could be higher.

07:04:40 21        Q.  -- for the entire duration.

07:04:40 22        A.  It could be higher.

07:04:42 23        Q.  Oh, the minimum is 18 is what you're

07:04:45 24  saying?

07:04:46 25        A.  Minimum.  That's why I call it a


                                                                306










07:04:49  1  conservative estimate.  It could be higher than

07:04:52  2  that.  We don't have the data point.

07:04:54  3            And in addition to that, they could be

07:04:55  4  exposed to much more than that by the multiple times

07:04:58  5  they're opening the door and again getting a blast

07:05:00  6  of whatever toxic gas is in the oven at the time,

07:05:04  7  which I ignore that component.  I'm being

07:05:08  8  conservative.

07:05:09  9        Q.  And the 53 is arrived by doing 6 by 8

07:05:11 10  times 70?

07:05:12 11        A.  Correct.

07:05:13 12        Q.  Okay.  If you'll write that down, I would

07:05:16 13  much appreciate that.

07:05:34 14            And where is the opening and closing of

07:05:36 15  the door 20 to 60 times accounted for?

07:05:40 16        A.  It is not accounted for; hence, if I did a

07:05:43 17  count for that, then I would have to make that

07:05:46 18  calculation, and it would only increase these

07:05:49 19  numbers, knowing what we know with regards to carbon

07:05:54 20  monoxide being present above 200 parts per million

07:05:57 21  in the oven, COAF, knowing that when one inhales

07:06:03 22  that, it will be exceeding the instantaneous amount

07:06:06 23  of 200 parts per million.

07:06:09 24            So in this time weighted average, I did

07:06:12 25  not include the instantaneous amount one would


                                                                307










07:06:17  1  inhale or be exposed to when they open the oven

07:06:20  2  door.

07:06:20  3        Q.  So you're being generous, but not...

07:06:25  4        A.  I call it being conservative.

07:06:27  5        Q.  Okay.  And so the 70 PPM is ambient and

07:06:30  6  the 200 PPM is COAF; is that right?

07:06:39  7        A.  I don't see where there's 200 here.

07:06:41  8        Q.  Greater than 200 PPM ceiling?

07:06:45  9        A.  That is the ceiling limit that is quoted,

07:06:52 10  200 parts per million.

07:06:54 11        Q.  Quoted where?

07:06:56 12        A.  I believe the 200 parts per million is

07:07:00 13  the -- it's in my declaration.  Do you mind if I

07:07:03 14  look at that?

07:07:06 15        Q.  Oh, absolutely.

07:07:50 16        A.  So CAL-OSHA has a ceiling limit of 200

07:07:54 17  parts per million.

07:07:56 18        Q.  So you're basing the 200 parts per million

07:08:00 19  ceiling on a CAL-OSHA requirement that exposures be

07:08:05 20  at a maximum of 200.

07:08:07 21            If they're more than 200, you're in

07:08:10 22  violation?

07:08:11 23        A.  That's how I understand it, correct.

07:08:18 24        Q.  And what is the duration of the ceiling

07:08:19 25  exposure?


                                                                308










07:08:19  1        A.  The way I understand ceiling limit is an

07:08:19  2  instantaneous amount.

07:08:29  3        Q.  So it could be for a millisecond and you

07:08:29  4  would violate the standard, in your opinion?

07:08:32  5        A.  The way I believe, it is an exposure of

07:08:34  6  the ceiling limit where one would need to -- again,

07:08:36  7  I don't know what the definition is, but I would

07:08:39  8  anticipate it being one is exposed to the toxic gas

07:08:44  9  ceiling limit, and it is inhaled.

07:08:46 10        Q.  Isn't really a ceiling limit five minutes?

07:08:51 11            MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts.

07:08:52 12            THE WITNESS:  I haven't read that

07:08:54 13  definition with regards to CAL-OSHA.

07:08:57 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:08:58 15        Q.  And what about with respect to OSHA.

07:09:00 16            OSHA has a ceiling limit of 200 as well,

07:09:03 17  doesn't it?

07:09:03 18        A.  I haven't seen that.

07:09:05 19        Q.  Okay.  So you don't know one way or the

07:09:07 20  other whether the ceiling limit is for a duration of

07:09:10 21  time?

07:09:10 22            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

07:09:11 23  testimony.

07:09:12 24            THE WITNESS:  I take the definition of a

07:09:14 25  ceiling limit or sometimes called the instantaneous


                                                                309










07:09:14  1  limit per its definition.

07:09:19  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:09:19  3        Q.  Meaning it could be a microsecond and I've

07:09:24  4  violated the standard; is that it?

07:09:26  5        A.  Again, I don't know if that is the

07:09:27  6  standard, indeed, but the way I would interpret it

07:09:30  7  is an exposure which would require some inhalation.

07:09:34  8        Q.  Okay.  So one second, I take a breath for

07:09:37  9  one second and I've exceeded the 200 PPM ceiling, is

07:09:41 10  what you're saying?

07:09:43 11        A.  Some people can breathe faster; some

07:09:45 12  people can breathe slower.  If you're exposed to

07:09:48 13  that high level of carbon monoxide as in this case,

07:09:51 14  then I would classify that, and from what I've seen,

07:09:54 15  I understand it to be an instantaneous amount where

07:09:58 16  you are exposed and you have inhaled that amount.

07:10:01 17        Q.  Have you specifically researched the basis

07:10:04 18  on which these regulatory agencies came up with the

07:10:08 19  200 PPM ceiling?

07:10:11 20        A.  From a historical standpoint?

07:10:14 21        Q.  No.  Why did they come up with the 200 PPM

07:10:18 22  ceiling?  What was the process by which they came up

07:10:21 23  with the 200 PPM ceiling; do you know that?

07:10:24 24        A.  I have not dug into that.

07:10:26 25        Q.  You don't know one way or another as to


                                                                310










07:10:29  1  why they come up with --

07:10:29  2        A.  I have not undertaken that research.

07:10:31  3        Q.  And you haven't undertaken the research as

07:10:35  4  to whether that ceiling was for a specific duration

07:10:38  5  of time?

07:10:38  6            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

07:10:39  7            THE WITNESS:  I have not seen that

07:10:41  8  requirement with CAL-OSHA.

07:10:42  9  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:10:42 10        Q.  Okay.  Or any other regulation, for that

07:10:45 11  matter, which has a ceiling limit?

07:10:47 12            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

07:10:50 13            THE WITNESS:  Per my declaration, I

07:10:54 14  have -- I'm quoting CAL-OSHA.  I'm not quoting any

07:10:57 15  other instantaneous limit.  So again, I haven't

07:11:01 16  researched that.

07:11:02 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:11:03 18        Q.  You mentioned a couple of regulations.

07:11:28 19            Now, is this method of determining the TWA

07:11:30 20  for exposure, is that published somewhere?

07:11:32 21        A.  As far as I understand, it's readily

07:11:35 22  available.

07:11:36 23        Q.  Okay.  Have you seen this method being

07:11:38 24  used for estimated carbon monoxide total weighted

07:11:40 25  average exposures?


                                                                311










07:11:41  1        A.  Again, from what I have seen in the past,

07:11:45  2  it's usually denoted in a journal equation form,

07:11:52  3  which is similar to what I've presented here today.

07:11:54  4        Q.  And the equation is just one -- one

07:11:59  5  calculation, isn't it?  Because total weighted --

07:12:04  6  just bear with me.

07:12:06  7            In my math classes when you look at the

07:12:09  8  weighted average, if, you know, T-1 is one plus, T-1

07:12:14  9  and 2, sigma, and it sums up all of those to get an

07:12:19 10  average, but you've used just one number?

07:12:22 11        A.  You're describing that very nicely.  It's

07:12:27 12  a summation of if one is experiencing different

07:12:32 13  levels of exposure at different times, one would

07:12:35 14  have to take that into consideration.  That is when

07:12:38 15  one would need to have the other components in the

07:12:41 16  equation.

07:12:42 17            But in this case, we know that the folks

07:12:47 18  here are within 13 feet of the oven and there's a CO

07:12:56 19  detector alarm within 13 feet of the oven, so we are

07:13:00 20  putting that as one constant exposure level.  It

07:13:05 21  could have been higher.  We don't know.

07:13:08 22        Q.  Okay.  So if you -- strike that.

07:13:08 23            And so Brandon Adams has the same TWA

07:13:21 24  numbers, even though the door is open, given at

07:13:24 25  different times, but the hours are the same.


                                                                312










07:13:25  1            Is that why, because you're just

07:13:26  2  considering the hours being within 13 feet for all

07:13:28  3  of these plaintiffs and not considering the door

07:13:31  4  openings?

07:13:32  5            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates testimony.  It's

07:13:34  6  been asked and answered.

07:13:36  7            Go ahead.

07:13:36  8            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'm being very

07:13:38  9  conservative.  I did not take into -- all the TWA

07:13:43 10  calculations presented in my declaration did not

07:13:46 11  take into consideration the exposure coming from the

07:13:48 12  multiple times of -- of door openings and exposures

07:13:54 13  and elevated exposures that these plaintiffs were

07:13:58 14  experiencing.  Again, that's why I termed this as a

07:14:02 15  conservative approach.

07:14:04 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:14:04 17        Q.  And the number of door openings per day,

07:14:13 18  this was provided to you by plaintiffs in their

07:14:17 19  declarations?

07:14:17 20        A.  Yes, I believe so.

07:14:19 21        Q.  And you find all of these numbers to be

07:14:22 22  credible?

07:14:23 23        A.  I do, indeed.  They actually map with some

07:14:28 24  testimony with the amount of times these folks are

07:14:31 25  opening the door.


                                                                313










07:14:33  1        Q.  So how does one open the door 70 times in

07:14:37  2  seven hours, as Julie Lacy did, and get any work

07:14:41  3  done?

07:14:41  4            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

07:14:43  5            THE WITNESS:  You would have to ask her

07:14:45  6  that.

07:14:46  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:14:46  8        Q.  But about believe when she said that she

07:14:48  9  opened the door 70 times in seven hours?

07:14:52 10        A.  I have no reason to not believe her.

07:14:57 11        Q.  You took -- but, you know, you are

07:14:58 12  thinking that a bake cycle is 20 to 30 minutes, and

07:14:58 13  70 times every seven hours, how many times an hour

07:15:02 14  does she have to open the door?

07:15:04 15        A.  Several times.  And several people have

07:15:06 16  testified that they were opening the door very

07:15:09 17  frequently, multiple times within a bake cycle.

07:15:13 18  That's what I recall reading.

07:15:14 19        Q.  Is that the proper use of the oven?

07:15:18 20            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, vague.

07:15:20 21            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'll have to defer --

07:15:25 22  I've never used this oven.  I don't know what -- how

07:15:28 23  to use the oven.  I don't know what to say.

07:15:31 24            But I do know that there were various

07:15:33 25  testimonies highlighting the abnormal operation of


                                                                314










07:15:39  1  this oven.  It wasn't maintaining temperature;

07:15:43  2  hence, they were opening and closing.

07:15:45  3            So there were numerous testimonies and

07:15:48  4  references that highlights why or can explain

07:15:51  5  potentially why they're opening and closing this

07:15:54  6  oven door so many times.

07:15:55  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:15:55  8        Q.  And do you have any idea as to how long

07:15:59  9  the oven door is held open when they load and unload

07:16:05 10  the product?

07:16:09 11        A.  I do not recall that from testimonies over

07:16:15 12  it.

07:16:41 13        Q.  Now, just picking up on the issue of some

07:16:43 14  of the employees opening and closing the door up to

07:16:47 15  70 times in seven hours, there are multiple

07:16:52 16  employees who are working at the same time in the

07:16:55 17  bakery; correct?

07:16:58 18            MR. JARCHI:  Vague as to time, incomplete

07:17:01 19  hypothetical, form.

07:17:02 20            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure

07:17:06 21  who's working with who or what times.  I'm not sure.

07:17:09 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:17:10 23        Q.  So have you not read the records, time

07:17:12 24  records of these employees or done any analysis of

07:17:15 25  it to see who's working at what times?


                                                                315










07:17:17  1        A.  Again, I'm using data from their

07:17:22  2  declaration.

07:17:23  3        Q.  At face value?

07:17:24  4        A.  It's very clear what I'm doing.  I haven't

07:17:27  5  used anything beyond that.

07:17:28  6        Q.  But you've taken their representations at

07:17:31  7  face value that that's what they're doing in terms

07:17:34  8  of how many times they access the ovens in their

07:17:39  9  given shifts?

07:17:39 10        A.  Again, I'm taking the data that they

07:17:41 11  provided in their declarations for my analysis.

07:17:44 12        Q.  You didn't check the credibility or the

07:17:47 13  validity of that data; you're just taking it at face

07:17:49 14  value; is that correct?

07:17:49 15            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, asked and

07:17:51 16  answered.

07:17:51 17            THE WITNESS:  Again, folks are providing

07:17:53 18  me -- are providing the case with declarations, and

07:17:56 19  I'm using those data points to come up with my

07:17:59 20  exposure analysis.

07:18:00 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:18:01 22        Q.  Okay.  So, for example, on a given day,

07:18:04 23  January 27, 2009 at 7:00 a.m., we had Julie Lee,

07:18:11 24  Rodriguez and Lacy working at the same time.  And

07:18:16 25  Lee says she opens the oven up to 75 times,


                                                                316










07:18:20  1  Rodriguez says she opens it up to 24 times during

07:18:26  2  her shift, and Lacy says she opens it up to 70 times

07:18:30  3  in her shift.

07:18:33  4            So doesn't that seem really excessive when

07:18:38  5  three individuals are working at the same time that

07:18:42  6  they would access the oven with that sort of

07:18:45  7  frequency?

07:18:45  8            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

07:18:47  9  also argumentative, also misstates the testimony as

07:18:51 10  framed.

07:18:52 11            THE WITNESS:  Again, there is a range of

07:18:58 12  door openings, and if there are multiple people

07:19:03 13  working the oven, then I would assume this range

07:19:06 14  takes that into account.

07:19:14 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:19:29 16        Q.  Now, when you inspected the Albertsons

07:19:33 17  store -- I think it was the 27th of September, 2016,

07:19:39 18  was it?

07:19:49 19        A.  Correct.

07:19:49 20        Q.  And you've indicated that you interviewed

07:19:54 21  Julie Lee at that time?

07:19:56 22        A.  Correct.

07:19:57 23        Q.  How long did you talk to her?

07:20:08 24        A.  In totality, no more than 20 minutes.

07:20:21 25  Again, I don't recall that with high definition, but


                                                                317










07:20:25  1  it wasn't a lengthy interview; it was more of a

07:20:31  2  discussion.  So I understand where the detector was,

07:20:36  3  understand how it was moving, and understand,

07:20:38  4  actually, what she meant in her testimony with

07:20:42  5  regards to placing it in a cabinet and where that

07:20:44  6  was located.

07:20:45  7        Q.  And tell me in as great detail as you

07:20:50  8  possibly can remember the substance of the

07:20:52  9  conversation, all of the details.

07:20:53 10            Where did she tell you the detectors were?

07:20:57 11  Everything you can recall.

07:20:59 12            MR. JARCHI:  Overbroad, calls for a

07:21:02 13  narrative.

07:21:03 14            THE WITNESS:  Again, in line with her

07:21:05 15  testimony, it's not a hundred percent sure if the CO

07:21:13 16  detector was introduced into the bakery in January

07:21:17 17  or February.  It's about that time in 2009 they --

07:21:24 18  and it was a CO detector obtained from the store

07:21:28 19  itself off the shelf.

07:21:31 20            It was given to Julie, I believe, by her

07:21:37 21  colleague, Tina Klein, and when -- the first mention

07:21:47 22  of alarming, I believe, was when the door of the

07:21:51 23  oven was open, it started alarming.

07:21:56 24            She also made reference to placing the

07:22:05 25  detector on a baker's table, which she identified to


                                                                318










07:22:09  1  me when we were there.  It was adjacent, just next

07:22:13  2  to the oven, and also placing it up on that work

07:22:24  3  shelf.

07:22:24  4            She also mentioned that they placed it

07:22:30  5  adjacent, opposite the oven, and powered it with

07:22:36  6  mains power on the wall, I believe, with a cord and

07:22:41  7  it also alarmed at that location.  And just to

07:22:46  8  clarify, it also alarmed, as I mentioned previously,

07:22:50  9  on the baker's table on the shelf so it was alarming

07:22:54 10  at multiple locations -- not only multiple

07:22:58 11  locations, but also using batteries and when in the

07:23:01 12  state of powered by the mains power.

07:23:04 13            And at some point in time, I believe she

07:23:11 14  mentions -- or she mentioned that it was becoming

07:23:17 15  annoying, so they tried to place it in a cabinet or

07:23:21 16  a drawer, which she showed me.  And I believe

07:23:27 17  someone measured it -- I measured it.  It was 23

07:23:30 18  feet away from the location.

07:23:36 19  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:23:36 20        Q.  The drawer was?

07:23:38 21        A.  Yes.

07:23:38 22        Q.  And it was alarming in the drawer?

07:23:41 23        A.  Yes.  And again, at some other point in

07:23:46 24  time after that, it was so annoying that they pulled

07:23:50 25  out the batteries, and that occurred -- I think


                                                                319










07:23:55  1  taken from her testimony, that was in mid-February

07:24:02  2  2009.

07:24:05  3        Q.  So they installed it sometime in January

07:24:10  4  of 2009 and disabled it a month and a half later?

07:24:14  5            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

07:24:15  6            THE WITNESS:  As I mentioned, she obtained

07:24:19  7  the CO detector sometime in January or February.

07:24:26  8  It's not clear reading her testimony exactly the

07:24:30  9  month.

07:24:31 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:24:34 11        Q.  And so a few days or weeks later, they

07:24:38 12  decide to pull out the batteries and silence the

07:24:42 13  detector; is that what she said?

07:24:45 14        A.  Based on her -- my interview with her and

07:24:48 15  her testimony, I believe that's what happened,

07:24:50 16  correct.

07:24:50 17        Q.  Okay.  And then was there another detector

07:24:54 18  that was placed?

07:24:57 19        A.  There's mention of another detector, and I

07:25:02 20  believe reading Julie Lee's testimony, I believe she

07:25:09 21  says, "It was after my break" of some period of

07:25:12 22  time, sometime later.  I think she was gone for six

07:25:20 23  or nine months' period, and I believe someone else

07:25:25 24  brought in a CO detector.  I believe Byrd mentioned

07:25:32 25  that he -- I think he said he brought it in.


                                                                320










07:25:35  1            But again, some people -- again reading

07:25:39  2  the testimonies, some people recall there was a

07:25:42  3  second detector; some people don't remember a second

07:25:46  4  detector whatsoever.

07:25:47  5            So again, with memory loss and all the

07:25:52  6  rest of it, it's very fuzzy what actually happened,

07:25:56  7  but my understanding reading Julie Lee's testimony

07:26:00  8  specifically with regards to the sequence of events,

07:26:03  9  that was very clear to me.

07:26:05 10        Q.  And sticking with the interview, did you

07:26:09 11  talk about anything else with Julie Lee?

07:26:12 12        A.  Not that I recall.

07:26:19 13        Q.  Did she talk about walking around with the

07:26:22 14  detector at different places and it going off?

07:26:27 15        A.  Yes -- well, she -- I was mentioning that

07:26:31 16  she was placing it at different locations, and those

07:26:35 17  locations it was alarming, including the cabinet

07:26:42 18  drawer, which was some distance away, 23 feet away.

07:26:49 19        Q.  So she indicated that the alarm was placed

07:26:53 20  in a drawer and closed 23 feet away and it was still

07:26:57 21  alarming?

07:26:57 22        A.  She said that it was alarming in the

07:27:03 23  drawer.

07:27:04 24        Q.  In the drawer?

07:27:05 25        A.  Correct, and it was so annoying that she


                                                                321










07:27:08  1  had to pull out the batteries.

07:27:10  2        Q.  Okay.  And what make and model was this CO

07:27:15  3  alarm?

07:27:15  4        A.  I have no information with regards to

07:27:18  5  that.

07:27:18  6        Q.  Have you made any effort to determine what

07:27:22  7  make and model the CO alarm was?

07:27:25  8        A.  Given the length of time that has passed,

07:27:29  9  no, I haven't made an effort to investigate that.

07:27:32 10        Q.  Tina Klein testified that she made a use

07:27:32 11  record and would have submitted it to Albertsons.

07:27:39 12            So did you not ask Albertsons and try to

07:27:42 13  determine what the make and model of that alarm was?

07:27:45 14        A.  I personally did not.

07:27:47 15        Q.  Did you not consider it important to your

07:27:50 16  opinions to know what the alarm was?

07:27:54 17        A.  I didn't consider it imperative, because

07:28:01 18  most of the traditional CO detectors sold in places

07:28:06 19  like Albertsons and other consumer areas basically

07:28:11 20  follow the same detection protocol, which is based

07:28:16 21  on the UL 2034 standard.

07:28:18 22        Q.  Okay.  And so what is the UL 2034

07:28:34 23  standard?  What is the purpose of it?

07:28:34 24  ///

07:28:34 25  ///


                                                                322










07:28:54  1            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 27 was

07:28:54  2            marked for identification by the

07:28:54  3            deposition reporter and is attached

07:28:54  4            hereto.)

07:28:54  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:28:55  6        Q.  I'm going to hand you what I've marked as

07:28:58  7  Exhibit 37, and tell me if you are familiar with

07:29:01  8  this document.

07:29:05  9        A.  Yes.  It's Exhibit 27, UL 2034, entitled

07:29:10 10  Single and Multiple Station Carbon Monoxide Alarms.

07:29:14 11        Q.  Okay.  Now, if you'll flip to the back,

07:29:18 12  there's a Table 38.1.  I draw your attention to that

07:29:23 13  table.

07:29:33 14            Have you seen that table before?

07:29:34 15        A.  Yes.

07:29:36 16        Q.  And what does this table depict?

07:29:40 17        A.  This table depicts what I would term an

07:29:51 18  alarming protocol, and it describes when a CO

07:29:54 19  detector should alarm when detecting carbon

07:29:58 20  monoxide.

07:29:58 21        Q.  Alarming as in frightening?

07:30:02 22        A.  I don't understand what you mean.

07:30:04 23        Q.  Just kidding.  Late in the day.

07:30:25 24            So the top part of that carbon monoxide

07:30:29 25  response time, the first line there is 70 plus or


                                                                323










07:30:33  1  minus 5 PPM, and the response time says 60 to 24.

07:30:39  2            What does that mean?

07:30:41  3        A.  That means that the detector should alarm

07:30:50  4  at 70 parts per million only after 60 minutes of

07:30:56  5  detecting 70 parts per million.

07:31:00  6        Q.  So greater than 60 minutes and less than

07:31:04  7  240 minutes; is that correct?

07:31:06  8        A.  That's correct.

07:31:07  9        Q.  And then at 150 it's supposed to alarm at

07:31:10 10  greater than 10 minutes but less than 50 minutes,

07:31:15 11  then?

07:31:15 12        A.  That's correct.

07:31:16 13        Q.  And then at 400 it's greater than four

07:31:18 14  minutes and less than 15 minutes?

07:31:22 15        A.  That's correct.

07:31:22 16        Q.  And then the false alarms at 70 PPM, it

07:31:27 17  should not beep or go off in less than 60 minutes.

07:31:33 18            Is that what it's saying?

07:31:35 19        A.  That's correct.

07:31:35 20        Q.  Okay.  And you are using 70 PPM as the

07:31:43 21  level at which the alarm went off in your assumptions;

07:31:47 22  is that correct?

07:31:47 23        A.  That's correct.

07:31:48 24        Q.  Now, why did you choose 70?

07:31:50 25        A.  Because, again, 70 parts per million is


                                                                324










07:31:55  1  the minimal alarm level, absolute concentration in

07:32:02  2  ambient that the CO detector would alarm at.

07:32:10  3        Q.  Okay.  And that's 70 PPM ambient levels;

          4  right?

          5            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

          6            THE WITNESS:  70 PPM in an ambient

          7  environment.

          8  BY MR. TAYAB:

          9        Q.  For carbon monoxide?

07:32:19 10        A.  That's correct.

07:32:20 11        Q.  And if you'd flip to the next page.  And

07:32:36 12  the 70 PPM is -- help me understand -- would that be

07:32:42 13  70 PPM at 60 minutes or more would have a certain

07:32:48 14  level of carboxy hemoglobin in the body?

07:32:54 15        A.  It would.  What that is, I do not know.

07:32:56 16  I'm not a toxicologist.

07:32:58 17        Q.  Okay.  Do you have in any views on this

07:33:01 18  that you see here?

07:33:02 19            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

07:33:03 20            THE WITNESS:  No, I don't.

07:33:04 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:33:06 22        Q.  Not one way or the other?

07:33:08 23        A.  No.

07:33:08 24        Q.  And that's the role of a toxicologist and

07:33:11 25  not you?


                                                                325










07:33:12  1        A.  Correct.

07:33:12  2        Q.  Now, Julie Lee indicated that as soon as

07:33:24  3  Lafayette Wallace opened the door while she walked

07:33:29  4  in with Tina Klein with that carbon monoxide

07:33:33  5  detector, it went off.

07:33:35  6            What concentration of carbon monoxide

07:33:37  7  would trigger that kind of a reaction?

07:33:41  8            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony.

07:33:44  9            THE WITNESS:  Given the testimony of Julie

07:33:48 10  Lee opening the door, it seems it could be a high

07:33:57 11  concentration for it to trigger the CO detector to

07:34:01 12  alarm.

07:34:03 13            It may have been 150 parts per million at

07:34:09 14  ten minutes; it may have been 400 PPM at four

07:34:14 15  minutes.  So I don't know.  I wasn't there.  All I

07:34:20 16  can assume, based on the UL 2034, that it was 150

07:34:28 17  during this time period or 400.

07:34:30 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:34:30 19        Q.  So if it was -- and so she testified that

07:34:33 20  it went off right away, and so as the door opened,

07:34:38 21  the alarm went off?

07:34:40 22            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates testimony.

07:34:42 23            THE WITNESS:  I don't recall reading

07:34:47 24  "right away."

07:34:47  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:34:48  2        Q.  What do you recall reading?

07:34:49  3        A.  I recall reading it alarmed when the door

07:34:53  4  was open.

07:34:53  5        Q.  Okay.  So do you have a sense of what the

07:34:57  6  time interval was between the opening of the door

07:35:01  7  and the alarm going off?

07:35:02  8        A.  That information isn't provided.

07:35:05  9        Q.  Okay.  And did you also read the testimony

07:35:07 10  of Lafayette Wallace?

07:35:11 11        A.  I did.

07:35:12 12        Q.  He doesn't recall the alarm going off when

07:35:16 13  he opened the door, does he?

07:35:17 14            MR. JARCHI:  Vague.

07:35:18 15            THE WITNESS:  I don't recall his

07:35:20 16  testimony.

07:35:21 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:35:21 18        Q.  In fact, he only recalls -- he only

07:35:25 19  recalls the alarm going off once ever; isn't that

07:35:28 20  correct?

07:35:28 21            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates testimony,

07:35:47  9        A.  I believe I did.

07:35:51 10        Q.  In your document here on your deposition

07:35:56 11  notes, you indicate that Lafayette Wallace says he

07:35:59 12  heard the alarm:

07:36:00 13                "There was only one time

07:36:03 14            where I was there when they had

07:36:05 15            it hooked up and it went off."

07:36:10 16            That's what you have in your notes.

07:36:12 17            But he doesn't recall it going off when

07:36:14 18  Julie Lee opened the door, did he?

07:36:16 19            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

07:36:17 20  testimony.

07:36:29  1  alarms; right?

07:36:30  2        A.  Yes.

07:36:35  4  that as soon as she put the batteries in and walked

07:36:38  5  into the bakery and the door was opened, the alarm

07:36:39  6  went off?

07:37:08 11        Q.  Now, when the alarm goes off, what is the

07:37:11 12  sound one hears?

07:37:12 13        A.  When the alarm is triggered on a typical

07:37:15 14  UL 2034 CO detector, you will hear multiple beeps,

07:37:24 15  three or four beeps continuously, a pause, multiple

07:37:28 16  beeps, pause, multiple beeps, pause.

07:37:33 17        Q.  And it stops only after the exposure is

07:37:35 18  removed?

07:37:36 19            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

07:37:39 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:37:40 21        Q.  In other words, will it continue to beep

07:37:42 22  as long as it's sensing a certain level of carbon

07:37:48 23  monoxide that caused it to go off in the first

07:37:51 24  place?

07:37:51 25            MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical and


                                                                329










07:37:55  1  misstates the testimony.

07:37:55  2            THE WITNESS:  I believe it continues to

07:37:56  3  beep only during exposure.  If the level drops, it

07:37:58  4  would cease beeping.

07:37:59  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:38:15  6        Q.  So if the alarm goes off as a result of a

07:38:22  7  carbon monoxide incident, does the alarm, like you

07:38:28  8  said, beep in a number of times, say four times, and

07:38:30  9  then a pause and then it beeps and then a pause and

07:38:35 10  it beeps another four times?  Is that how it works?

07:38:37 11        A.  That's how it's typically described,

07:38:39 12  correct.

07:38:39 13        Q.  And what's the decibel level of these

07:38:42 14  beeps?

07:38:42 15        A.  The decibel level is above 75 or above 80

07:38:47 16  DB.

07:38:48 17        Q.  And why is above 80 DB chosen as the

07:38:55 18  decibel level?

07:38:57 19        A.  I'm not sure.

07:38:58 20        Q.  Is it to incite a reaction in the

07:39:00 21  listeners of that alarm to take some action?

07:39:03 22            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

07:39:07 23            THE WITNESS:  It's a CO detector.  It's a

07:39:09 24  CO alarm, and that's its function, to alarm

07:39:12 25  following the UL 2034 protocol.


                                                                330










07:39:15  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:39:15  2        Q.  Did anyone -- did Julie Lee evacuate the

07:39:19  3  building when she heard the alarm?

07:39:21  4        A.  Not that I read in her testimony.

07:39:24  5        Q.  Did she take any action in response to the

07:39:27  6  alarm going off?

07:39:29  7        A.  I believe she was speaking and bringing up

07:39:34  8  this issue with the store manager, Mr. Byrd, with

07:39:37  9  her colleagues, and they were trying to get down to

07:39:40 10  the bottom of the situation.

07:39:42 11        Q.  Okay.  Now, the alarm --

07:39:45 12            MR. TAYAB:  So let's take a break.

07:39:47 13            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Thank you.  Going off

07:39:52 14  the record.  The time is 7:39 p.m.

07:39:52 15            (Whereupon, a recess was held

07:51:11 16            from 7:39 p.m. to 7:51 p.m.)

07:51:11 17            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the

07:51:13 18  beginning of Media Number 5 in the videotaped

07:51:18 19  deposition of Kosmas Galatsis.  Going back on the

07:51:22 20  record.  The time is 7:51 p.m.

07:51:26 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:51:26 22        Q.  Prior to the break, Doctor, we were

07:51:28 23  talking about the alarms limited by a CO detector.

07:51:28 24            So I've taken a look at an exemplar first

07:51:36 25  of a detector, and there's an alarm guide in the


                                                                331










07:51:39  1  back of it which says four beeps is a CO alarm, and

07:51:42  2  you testified that that beep could be 80 decibels or

07:51:46  3  more.

07:51:46  4            So that's its sound intensity; is that

07:51:51  5  correct?

07:51:51  6        A.  I believe so.

07:51:52  7        Q.  And then it says one chirp per minute to

07:51:56  8  replace battery.

07:51:58  9            What's a chirp?

07:51:59 10        A.  A chirp is a superfast beep.  A chirp is a

07:52:05 11  chirp -- I'm sure we've all heard it -- where a

07:52:07 12  smoke alarm or a CO detector needs to be replaced

07:52:12 13  with batteries.

07:52:13 14        Q.  And what decibels does a chirp sound at?

07:52:17 15        A.  A chirp is using the same buzzer, so it's

07:52:29 16  the same buzzer and it's also very loud.

07:52:32 17        Q.  So it is on the order of 80 decibels?

07:52:34 18        A.  I would say so.  I would say so.

07:52:37 19        Q.  And it's just that its duration is shorter

07:52:39 20  than a beep?

07:52:40 21        A.  That's correct.

07:52:41 22        Q.  And a beep is in the order of what time

07:52:44 23  duration?

07:52:45 24        A.  Again, if I had to quantify that in

07:52:48 25  milliseconds, I wouldn't -- I would -- again, I


                                                                332










07:52:53  1  don't have that data.

07:52:56  2        Q.  But the chirp is in shorter duration than

07:53:00  3  the beep, as you understand it?

07:53:02  4        A.  That is my understanding, correct.

07:53:04  5        Q.  And this alarm guide says three chirps per

07:53:08  6  minute, malfunction, replace the alarm.

07:53:11  7            And so that means that it chirps three

07:53:14  8  times in succession and stops and then chirps again

07:53:19  9  a minute later and stops; right?

07:53:21 10        A.  If that's what it says.  If your exemplar

07:53:24 11  alarm says that, then I guess that is the case.

07:53:28 12        Q.  Okay.  So that's to specify a malfunction.

07:53:32 13            And here it says:

07:53:33 14                "Five chirps per minute to

07:53:35 15            the end of life alarm.  Replace

07:53:37 16            it, throw it away."

07:53:39 17            Is that consistent with your understanding

07:53:41 18  as to how these alarms typically function?

07:53:43 19        A.  The chirping, yes, for battery

07:53:48 20  replacement.  Three, four beeps for CO alarming.

07:53:53 21            Regarding A malfunction -- again, we've

07:53:56 22  got an exemplar.  If that's the case, that's the

07:54:00 23  case.  I'm not sure if it's different for another,

07:54:03 24  but I know that the UL 2034 doesn't normalize that

07:54:07 25  amongst their products.


                                                                333










07:54:09  1        Q.  And it says up here the alarm response

07:54:13  2  time is 400 PPM within 15 minutes.

07:54:16  3            So this alarm goes off at 400 PPM after 15

07:54:23  4  minutes.

07:54:25  5            Is that what you understand?

07:54:25  6            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,

07:54:27  7  misstates the evidence and misstates UL 2034.

07:54:30  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:54:31  9        Q.  I'm just reading the alarm guide from the

07:54:34 10  back of a First Alert alarm.

07:54:36 11            MR. JARCHI:  Still assumes facts.

07:54:37 12            THE WITNESS:  Sure.  That's fine.  But I

07:54:39 13  don't know what model -- I don't know what you're

07:54:43 14  reading.  All I can say regarding the CO detector is

07:54:47 15  that we discussed the UL 2034 protocol, and if

07:54:53 16  another detector is alarming at different times,

07:54:56 17  then that is the case.

07:54:57 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:54:58 19        Q.  So if this First Alert alarm says alarm

07:55:03 20  response time is 400 PPM within 15 minutes, does

07:55:07 21  that mean that it won't go off at a lower CO level?

07:55:13 22            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

07:55:15 23  incomplete hypothetical.

07:55:16 24            THE WITNESS:  I haven't studied the model,

07:55:19 25  make and model of CO detector that you're referring


                                                                334










07:55:22  1  to.  I don't understand the definition --

07:55:24  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:55:25  3        Q.  Would it help to see this picture?

07:55:26  4            MR. TAYAB:  Do you have a picture of this?

07:55:33  5            MS. GARRISON:  Yes.

07:55:34  6            THE WITNESS:  This is an exemplar CO

07:55:36  7  detector?

07:55:36  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:55:37  9        Q.  Yes.  I don't have pictures of CO

07:55:41 10  detectors, so just I printed it off the Internet.

07:55:46 11            I'll just give you this one, and I don't

07:55:48 12  think we need to enter it as an exhibit, but just

07:55:50 13  take a look at it.

07:55:50 14            MR. JARCHI:  I think if you're going to

07:55:52 15  show it to him, we should mark it.

07:55:56 16            MR. TAYAB:  Okay.  Can you explain this.

07:56:06 17            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 29 was

07:56:06 18            marked for identification by the

07:56:06 19            deposition reporter and is attached

07:56:07 20            hereto.)

07:56:07 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:56:08 22        Q.  Please take a look at Exhibit 29.  I will

07:56:10 23  represent to you that it's --

07:56:10 24            MR. JARCHI:  Can I see it first?

07:56:13 25            (Document handed to counsel.)


                                                                335










07:56:14  1            MR. JARCHI:  Thanks.

07:56:15  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:56:16  3        Q.  I will represent to you that it's an

07:56:17  4  exemplar of a First Alert Carbon Monoxide Detector.

07:56:21  5  I got a picture of that from the Internet, the

07:56:23  6  reverse side which has the warnings and

07:56:26  7  instructions.

07:56:26  8            MR. JARCHI:  I'm going to object; lacks

07:56:30  9  authenticity and foundation, assumes facts.

07:56:31 10  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:56:32 11        Q.  And the only reason I'm showing it to you

07:56:35 12  is that if you look at the alarm guide, the last

07:56:37 13  line of that, it says 400 PPM for 15 minutes is when

07:56:41 14  the alarm goes off.

07:56:43 15            And my question to you is:  Will it go off

07:56:46 16  at a level lower than that?

07:56:50 17        A.  The way --

07:56:50 18            MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  The same

07:56:52 19  objections; incomplete hypothetical.

07:56:59 20            THE WITNESS:  I'm reading in front of me

07:57:01 21  alarm response time, 400 parts per million within 15

07:57:07 22  minutes, and I translate that as -- again, for this

07:57:12 23  exemplar of a CO detector that is Exhibit 29, that

07:57:19 24  400 parts per million, if the CO detector is exposed

07:57:21 25  to 400 parts per million, it can respond faster than


                                                                336










07:57:23  1  15 minutes.  It can respond in one minute.

07:57:26  2  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:57:26  3        Q.  Okay.  But it needs to respond at 400

07:57:32  4  parts per million; is that your understanding?

07:57:34  5            MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.

07:57:35  6            THE WITNESS:  Again, that's what I've just

07:57:38  7  read.

07:57:38  8  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:57:38  9        Q.  Would it respond at 200 parts per million,

07:57:42 10  for example?

07:57:42 11        A.  I don't know.

07:57:43 12        Q.  Okay.  Would it respond at 70?

07:57:45 13            MR. JARCHI:  Same objection; vague and

07:57:46 14  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, lacks

07:57:48 15  foundation.

07:57:50 16            THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

07:57:51 17  BY MR. TAYAB:

07:57:52 18        Q.  Now, does it say anywhere there that it's

07:57:55 19  subject to UL 2034?

07:57:59 20        A.  Yes.

07:58:07 21        Q.  Okay.  Now, you testified earlier that

07:58:20 22  when you talked to Julie Lee and read her deposition

07:58:23 23  testimony, you understood that she connected the

07:58:29 24  batteries, put the batteries into the First Alert

07:58:32 25  alarm and it went off within a short period of time;


                                                                337










07:58:35  1  is that correct?

07:58:39  2        A.  Again, the definition of she connected the

07:58:42  3  batteries as you're asking, I didn't read that

07:58:45  4  anywhere.  So I'm not sure who connected the

07:58:48  5  batteries.  But when she received the CO detector,

07:58:54  6  it alarmed again, per her testimony, when the oven

07:59:00  7  door was open.

07:59:00  8        Q.  And are you certain that it was not the

07:59:04  9  chirps that we were talking about earlier?

07:59:07 10        A.  Again, for a brand new detector to be

07:59:12 11  opened out of the package at a supermarket, for it

07:59:15 12  to be plugged up to batteries and for it to

07:59:20 13  immediately fail, again, from my experience working

07:59:23 14  with CO detectors, that would be highly unlikely.

07:59:27 15        Q.  But several individuals have testified

07:59:29 16  that they thought it was a battery issue or an alarm

07:59:35 17  issue rather than it's going off because it's carbon

07:59:39 18  monoxide, isn't it?

07:59:41 19            MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and

07:59:42 20  ambiguous, misstates the testimony, incomplete

07:59:43 21  hypothetical, form.

07:59:44 22            THE WITNESS:  It's not uncommon for a

07:59:50 23  layperson to hear a CO detector alarming and to

07:59:57 24  consider it a chirp where that signifies battery

08:00:03 25  replacement, but in this situation, we could be


                                                                338










08:00:07  1  confident that it is a brand new CO detector with

08:00:11  2  new batteries straight out of the package per the

08:00:14  3  testimony that we have before us.

08:00:16  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:00:17  5        Q.  But it's also equally possible that a

08:00:20  6  layperson not familiar with CO alarms could hear

08:00:24  7  chirps and interpret that as an alarm, isn't it?

08:00:27  8            MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.

08:00:29  9            THE WITNESS:  The question is it equally

08:00:31 10  possible?  Can you repeat that?

         11            MR. TAYAB:  Can you read that back.

         12            (The record was read as follows:

         13            Q.   But it's also equally

         14            possible that a layperson not

         15            familiar with CO alarms could

         16            hear chirps and interpret that

08:00:31 17            as an alarm, isn't it?)

08:00:46 18            THE WITNESS:  Based on my experience, not

08:00:49 19  at all.

08:00:49 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:00:51 21        Q.  Marvin Byrd has testified over and over

08:00:54 22  again and said that he did not think the alarm went

08:00:57 23  off as a result of carbon monoxide.

08:00:59 24            You do not believe his testimony?

08:01:01 25        A.  It's not a situation of not believing his


                                                                339










08:01:04  1  testimony.  He's the store manager.  And the way I

08:01:08  2  understood it is that he's not there like the

08:01:12  3  employees within the bakery are in terms of

08:01:15  4  continuous amounts of time.

08:01:16  5            And given that situation and his

08:01:21  6  responsibilities with other departments in other

08:01:24  7  parts of the store, it's not a surprise to me that

08:01:28  8  some people working within that supermarket did not

08:01:31  9  hear it.

08:01:32 10        Q.  Well, there are other bakery employees who

08:01:35 11  never heard it go off, did they?

08:01:43 12        A.  There is Adams who testifies every time he

08:01:51 13  opened the DRO2G door, he felt dizzy consistent with

08:01:57 14  every time he opened the door.  There is I believe

08:02:06 15  Jarboe.  She -- and by the way, Mr. Adams was part

08:02:09 16  time, so his exposure to that scenario was somewhat

08:02:14 17  limited.

08:02:14 18            Likewise, Jarboe was also part time, and

08:02:18 19  from her testimony, she had severe memory loss.

08:02:21 20        Q.  So with respect to issues such as memory

08:02:24 21  loss and the dizziness that Adams felt, are you an

08:02:28 22  expert to assess those medical conditions and opine

08:02:32 23  on that?

08:02:32 24        A.  Absolutely not.

08:02:33 25        Q.  Okay.  So why are you talking about that?


                                                                340










08:02:35  1            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

08:02:37  2            THE WITNESS:  Because I found that

08:02:39  3  interesting in reading his testimony.

08:02:41  4  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:02:41  5        Q.  Well, my question to you was:  Do you not

08:02:44  6  believe the testimony of individuals such as Marvin

08:02:47  7  Byrd who said I've never heard an alarm as a result

08:02:51  8  of CO, the presence of CO, but he's heard it as a

08:02:55  9  result of weak batteries or whatever other reasons,

08:03:00 10  but you do not believe his testimony under oath?

08:03:04 11            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, and it's been

08:03:06 12  asked and it's been answered.

08:03:07 13            THE WITNESS:  Again, I believe I have

08:03:08 14  answered that question with respect to he's a store

08:03:11 15  manager, he's there periodically, sporadically, and

08:03:17 16  the others, the employees in the bakery, are there

08:03:23 17  considerably more time than he is.

08:03:25 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:03:25 19        Q.  But they called him into the bakery saying

08:03:30 20  that the alarm is alarming while it's alarming, but

08:03:33 21  he says he's never heard it.

08:03:34 22            You do not believe that testimony?

08:03:36 23            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.

08:03:37 24            THE WITNESS:  Again, that can be

08:03:40 25  explained.  He may himself have forgotten.


                                                                341










08:03:44  1            And again, various testimonies based on

08:03:47  2  that is somewhat inconsistent, but one thing is

08:03:51  3  certain is that the majority of the bakery

08:03:57  4  employees, the six out of the eight plaintiffs, did

08:04:01  5  hear the CO detector making a noise.

08:04:06  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:04:07  7        Q.  Lafayette Wallace testified that the noise

08:04:10  8  he heard was sort of like a background noise, almost

08:04:14  9  like the oven beeping.

08:04:16 10            Do you not believe that testimony?

08:04:18 11            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, assumes facts.

08:04:21 12            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'm not surprised

08:04:24 13  that some plaintiffs -- some plaintiffs, their

08:04:31 14  testimonies may be skewed.  They may have some lapse

08:04:36 15  in memory.  But the majority of them did hear the CO

08:04:41 16  alarm and also described it as either continuously

08:04:46 17  beeping, beep, beep, beep, or beeping in the plural.

08:04:51 18  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:04:52 19        Q.  Munoz testified it's like beep, beep, beep

08:04:55 20  but not constant.  It was a medium sound, not too

08:04:59 21  loud and not too low, just like a medium sound.

08:05:03 22            Does that sound like the carbon monoxide

08:05:07 23  alarm going off to you or does it sound like a

08:05:09 24  warning for weak batteries, for example?

08:05:10 25            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstates the


                                                                342










08:05:12  1  testimony.

08:05:13  2            THE WITNESS:  Again, how he defines medium

08:05:16  3  in the context of an audible alarm, I cannot define

08:05:22  4  that.

08:05:22  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:05:22  6        Q.  So even among these plaintiffs who work

08:05:25  7  together, there is no consistency in the testimony,

08:05:28  8  is there?

08:05:30  9            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

08:05:30 10  ambiguous, argumentative.

08:05:32 11            THE WITNESS:  As I mentioned, what's

08:05:33 12  profound to me is that the majority heard the CO

08:05:37 13  alarm beeping.

08:05:38 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:05:38 15        Q.  They heard some sound from the alarm.

08:05:41 16            How do you know it's the CO alarm that was

08:05:44 17  beeping?

08:05:45 18        A.  It's more likely than not it is beeping to

08:05:46 19  CO exposure than anything else.

08:05:51 20        Q.  There's a standard code for a CO alarm to

08:05:56 21  go off; right, four beeps, pause, and four beeps.

08:05:59 22            Did you see from the testimony any of them

08:06:03 23  testifying to such a pattern of sound?

08:06:06 24            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

08:06:06 25  ambiguous.


                                                                343










08:06:15  1            THE WITNESS:  I read continuous beeping,

08:06:17  2  beeping, beep, beep, beep, and some folks describing

08:06:20  3  it, I believe one or two, as potentially requiring

08:06:23  4  battery replacement which, when I read that, I think

08:06:29  5  that it's not uncommon for the layman to consider

08:06:35  6  that as a battery replacement warning, which again,

08:06:39  7  in this case, given the context of a brand new

08:06:42  8  detector with new batteries, that that would be the

08:06:46  9  case.

08:06:46 10            It's highly unlikely and much more likely

08:06:50 11  that it is indeed a CO detector, especially that we

08:06:54 12  sit here today know that we have a massive gorge

08:06:57 13  through the exchange, we have positive toxic gases

08:07:02 14  coming into the bake chamber, and we have that

08:07:06 15  dangerous situation going on.

08:07:07 16  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:07:07 17        Q.  So the testing that was done, it was 25

08:07:14 18  parts per million or 35 parts per million CO coming

08:07:18 19  out of the bake chamber.

08:07:19 20            Would that trigger a CO alarm?

08:07:22 21            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

08:07:23 22  ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.

08:07:25 23            THE WITNESS:  Again, I'm not sure what

08:07:27 24  you're referring to.  24 --

                                                                344










08:07:28  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:07:29  2        Q.  I'm referring to the testing that was done

08:07:31  3  on September 21st and 22nd.

08:07:34  4            That -- isn't that representative of the

08:07:36  5  levels of carbon monoxide generated by the oven at

08:07:39  6  the end of its life?

08:07:41  7            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

08:07:42  8  testimony and evidence.

08:07:46  9            THE WITNESS:  As far as I'm concerned, the

08:07:47 10  testing that took place 21st and 22nd, which was a

08:07:52 11  short period of time, 20, 30 minutes every few

08:07:55 12  hours, does not in any way, shape or form represent

08:08:00 13  an oven operating continuously over a full day.

08:08:07 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:08:07 15        Q.  So if it operates continuously for a full

08:08:11 16  day, is it your view that it would generate

08:08:14 17  progressively more levels of carbon monoxide?

08:08:17 18        A.  It is my view that if the oven is

08:08:19 19  operating continuously, the ambient environment is

08:08:25 20  accumulating in carbon monoxide, both from leakage

08:08:31 21  of carbon monoxide from the oven through the seals

08:08:36 22  from the numerous many times of the door opening,

08:08:40 23  and also, as time progresses, through the negative

08:08:45 24  feedback loop of intake or back drafting effects, as

08:08:50 25  I believe Dr. Romig described in his testimony.


                                                                345










08:08:54  1        Q.  Now, you haven't done any analysis of the

08:08:57  2  air change rates in the bakery; is that correct?

08:09:01  3            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,

08:09:02  4  misstates the testimony.

08:09:04  5            THE WITNESS:  I haven't analyzed the

08:09:07  6  ventilation system of the occupational space.

08:09:10  7  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:09:11  8        Q.  What if I were to tell you to assume that

08:09:13  9  the ACH is about 5 for that bakery.

08:09:18 10            Would that surprise you?

08:09:19 11            MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, incomplete

08:09:22 12  hypothetical, vague and ambiguous.

08:09:22 13            THE WITNESS:  I don't know what that is.

08:09:24 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:09:24 15        Q.  You don't know one way or the other what

08:09:26 16  the ACH is?

08:09:28 17        A.  No.

08:09:29 18        Q.  And given that there is a ventilation

08:09:31 19  system with vents pouring in air and returns sucking

08:09:37 20  out air, notwithstanding that HVAC system in the

08:09:42 21  bakery, your view is still that carbon monoxide

08:09:47 22  accumulates as the day progresses in the bakery; is

08:09:49 23  that correct?

08:09:49 24            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; incomplete

08:09:51 25  hypothetical, assumes facts, form.


                                                                346










08:09:54  1            THE WITNESS:  Comparing the 21st and 22nd

08:10:01  2  situation with a typical operation of the oven in

08:10:03  3  its state as we know it today with the massive

08:10:07  4  gorges, comparing those two is totally inappropriate.

08:10:11  5  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:10:12  6        Q.  And why is that?

08:10:14  7            MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.

08:10:14  8            THE WITNESS:  I believe I already answered

08:10:16  9  that with respect to accumulation at the ambient

08:10:21 10  level with the ambient increasing as the door is

08:10:24 11  open and with regards to the negative feedback loop

08:10:28 12  as the intake sucks it back in and creating a back

08:10:31 13  drafting effect.

08:10:33 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:10:33 15        Q.  So by that logic, the experiments that

08:10:38 16  Romig did on the exemplar oven for whatever time he

08:10:41 17  did it for, about an hour, so that's meaningless?

08:10:44 18            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,

08:10:46 19  misstates the testimony.

08:10:47 20            THE WITNESS:  No, it's not.

08:10:49 21  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:10:49 22        Q.  So you have a view that there's a value to

08:10:54 23  Romig's experimentation?

08:10:55 24        A.  Absolutely.

08:10:56 25        Q.  What's the value?


                                                                347










08:10:59  1        A.  First and foremost, the value --

08:11:42  2            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 30 was

08:11:42  3            marked for identification by the

08:11:42  4            deposition reporter and is attached

08:11:43  5            hereto.)

08:11:43  6  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:11:43  7        Q.  I've handed you a document marked as

08:11:46  8  Exhibit 30.

08:11:46  9            Can you identify that for the record.

08:11:48 10        A.  Yes.  It's a set of graphs where the X

08:11:52 11  axis is metric of seconds.  The leftmost axis is

08:12:04 12  a -- it varies, depending on the plot, but what is

08:12:07 13  consistent is the rightmost -- rightmost axis is

08:12:11 14  consistent of a COAF scale.

08:12:14 15            And we see here the title of the various

08:12:19 16  plots, Test Number 1 and so on.  That represents, I

08:12:23 17  believe, a combustion analysis taken from an

08:12:28 18  exemplar burner, if I recall correctly -- oven,

08:12:36 19  DRO2G.

08:12:36 20        Q.  And you consider that oven that was used

08:12:38 21  in the test to be an exemplar oven?

08:12:45 22        A.  That was as it was described, I believe,

08:12:47 23  by Dr. Romig.

08:12:48 24        Q.  Was it a complete oven?

08:12:50 25        A.  I don't believe it was.  I'm not sure.  I


                                                                348










08:12:53  1  have to take that back.  I'm not sure.

08:12:55  2        Q.  Was it connected to a ventilation system?

08:12:58  3        A.  I don't believe it was.

08:13:02  4        Q.  Was the oven inspected prior to the

08:13:05  5  analysis to ensure that its various parts were

08:13:11  6  functioning?

08:13:13  7            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

08:13:16  8            THE WITNESS:  Well, they are undertaking a

08:13:21  9  somewhat inspection, so I'm not sure what you mean

08:13:25 10  by that question.

08:13:26 11  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:13:26 12        Q.  Was the burner intact, for example?

08:13:29 13            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

08:13:29 14            THE WITNESS:  The burner was operational.

08:13:31 15  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:13:31 16        Q.  It was operational, but did it have all of

08:13:36 17  the parts that were necessary to make it

08:13:37 18  operational?

08:13:38 19            MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.

08:13:38 20            THE WITNESS:  I understand the burner was

08:13:41 21  functioning.

08:13:42 22  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:13:42 23        Q.  Did you know that they had bypassed

08:13:45 24  certain safety features to make that burner work?

08:13:48 25        A.  I did not read that in any testimony, that


                                                                349










08:13:50  1  they bypassed any safety features.

08:13:53  2        Q.  Well, haven't you read Romig's deposition?

08:13:57  3        A.  I have.

08:13:58  4        Q.  And you did not come across that testimony

08:14:01  5  in his deposition?

08:14:02  6        A.  I didn't read that he bypassed any safety

08:14:06  7  mechanism.  I didn't see that.

08:14:07  8        Q.  Did they not bypass the 30-second delay or

08:14:09  9  relays in the burner?

08:14:10 10            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and

08:14:12 11  ambiguous.

08:14:12 12            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure if they did or

08:14:14 13  not.

08:14:15 14  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:14:16 15        Q.  Did you not read that the pressure switch

08:14:20 16  in the draft inducer was not even there?

08:14:23 17        A.  I don't recall.

08:14:23 18            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

08:14:25 19  testimony.

08:14:25 20  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:14:26 21        Q.  Okay.  So you don't know one way or the

08:14:28 22  other?

08:14:28 23        A.  I don't recall.

08:14:29 24        Q.  Okay.  So what's the value of these plots?

08:14:34 25        A.  Well, as I was mentioning, the first value


                                                                350










08:14:37  1  is that the emissions coming from a burner cycle

08:14:43  2  turning on has typical characteristics of most

08:14:50  3  combustion burners, which is a low of the peak and

08:14:55  4  then coming to some steady state situation.  That's

08:14:59  5  the first.

08:15:02  6            The second is its sensitivity to both the

08:15:06  7  air and gas intakes where we can see, as we tweak

08:15:12  8  those variables just slightly, the carbon monoxide

08:15:18  9  varies considerably.

08:15:19 10            For example, Test Number 1 here is six

08:15:25 11  gases 3.5 inch water column.  What is emitted is

08:15:30 12  about the peak at about a 40-second mark is about

08:15:35 13  660 or -70 COAF.

08:15:38 14            And then adjusting those variables can

08:15:48 15  considerably increase the COAF emissions, as shown

08:15:54 16  in multiple examples here, reaching up to 8000, for

08:16:05 17  example, in Test Number 6, and Test Number 7 in the

08:16:11 18  2000s.

08:16:12 19            So the value, coming back to your

08:16:15 20  question, again solidifies what I have known myself

08:16:20 21  when it comes to combustion and burners in general

08:16:25 22  is that slight tweaks to the variables, such as gas

08:16:30 23  or the air fuel ratio, which is effectively what is

08:16:33 24  going on, considerably changes the emissions, the

08:16:38 25  flue gas emissions being produced.


                                                                351










08:16:43  1        Q.  And if you take away features that would

08:16:48  2  account for those emissions, such as a flue damper,

08:16:54  3  such as a purge cycle, that's what manufacturers put

08:17:00  4  those safety devices in place for, isn't it?

08:17:03  5            MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the

08:17:06  6  evidence and the testimony and compound.

08:17:11  7            THE WITNESS:  Again, what Dr. Romig has

08:17:20  8  presented here to me signifies that we have a

08:17:26  9  typical upstart in emissions, flue gas toxic gases

08:17:32 10  being produced, and that the burner in this case is

08:17:36 11  very sensitive to air and gas.

08:17:39 12  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:17:40 13        Q.  Now, are you going to rely on those graphs

08:17:42 14  for your opinions, for any of your opinions?

08:17:49 15        A.  Again, my opinions are within my

08:17:54 16  declaration, and possibly in the future, but at this

08:17:58 17  point in time, this further solidifies what I have

08:18:01 18  already known to be the case.

08:18:59 19            (Whereupon, Galatsis Exhibit 31 was

08:18:59 20            marked for identification by the

08:18:59 21            deposition reporter and is attached

08:18:59 22            hereto.)

08:18:59 23  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:19:51 24        Q.  Dr. Romig (sic), let me hand you what

08:19:56 25  I've --


                                                                352










08:19:57  1            MR. JARCHI:  For the record, he is not

08:19:59  2  Dr. Romig.

08:19:59  3  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:20:00  4        Q.  My apologies, Dr. Galatsis.  The other

08:20:03  5  doctor.  I'm sorry.  We've been talking about

08:20:06  6  Dr. Romig.  It's late in the day.

08:20:08  7            I've handed you Exhibit 31.  Would you

08:20:11  8  please identify that document for the record.

08:20:13  9        A.  Yes.  It is a publication that I have

08:20:16 10  authored titled "Engineering evidence for carbon

08:20:21 11  monoxide toxicity cases."

08:20:22 12        Q.  And where has this being published?

08:20:27 13        A.  It is being published in the Medicine

08:20:28 14  Science and the Law Journal.

08:20:30 15        Q.  And is this a peer-reviewed article?

08:20:32 16        A.  Yes.

08:20:33 17        Q.  If you'll flip to Page 2, I've highlighted

08:20:39 18  a section there.  It reads:

08:20:43 19                "This approach does not

08:20:44 20            quantify the inhaled 'ambient'

08:20:46 21            concentration level, but

08:20:48 22            provides a key data point to

08:20:48 23            determine appliance failure

08:20:50 24            identification (causation) and

08:20:54 25            key parameter input to determine


                                                                353










08:20:57  1            ambient CO levels and exposure

08:21:00  2            levels via modeling."

08:21:01  3            And it's talking about the air-free

08:21:04  4  number.

08:21:07  5            So it seems to me you're saying here that

08:21:07  6  this approach does not quantify inhaled ambient

08:21:07  7  concentration level; is that right?

08:21:18  8            MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony,

08:21:20  9  and in fact the words you read, the last part.

08:21:32 10            THE WITNESS:  No, the way you've described

08:21:33 11  it is incorrect.  What he's described here, he's

08:21:38 12  saying that the COAF emitted into a space is not the

08:21:43 13  diluted amount in the ambient, so one has to perform

08:21:46 14  a calculation that considers exchange values, volume

08:21:52 15  of the space, source concentration, which is COAF,

08:21:56 16  and time to come up with that figure.

08:21:58 17            So the inhaled -- so the inhaled in the

08:22:05 18  ambient, which is in quotation marks, is not the

08:22:08 19  same as what one would inhale in a COAF, so that is

08:22:12 20  what I was describing.

08:22:14 21            MR. JARCHI:  How much time?

08:22:15 22            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Seven hours 59 minutes.

08:22:27 23            MR. JARCHI:  Okay.  How many seconds?

08:22:29 24            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Now?  Approximately 45.

08:22:31 25  ///


                                                                354










08:22:31  1  BY MR. TAYAB:

08:22:31  2        Q.  Okay.  Next page:

08:22:32  3                "Walking with a CO meter

08:22:35  4            in hand is unacceptable."

08:22:36  5            So any views on that with Julie Lee

08:22:40  6  walking around with a CO monitor in her hand, do you

08:22:44  7  accept it?

08:22:44  8            MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, incomplete

08:22:47  9  hypothetical, misstates the evidence.

08:22:52 10            THE WITNESS:  Again, the context of this

08:22:54 11  paper is obtaining evidence for a carbon monoxide

08:22:57 12  case as an expert, and I've seen it numerous times

08:23:04 13  where an expert is trying to obtain accurate --

08:23:10 14  accurate data from a CO detector placing, walking

08:23:16 15  around a certain environment without leaving it on a

08:23:20 16  table.  I see them walking around when one should be

08:23:26 17  placing it on a table in a stationary location.  It

08:23:32 18  was describing that situation.

08:23:35 19            Sure, if one is walking around with a CO

08:23:42 20  detector such as the UEI we talked about a moment

08:23:43 21  ago and trying to obtain accurate data readings of a

08:23:47 22  certain location, that would not be reflective of

08:23:51 23  that location simply because the meter is in motion.

08:23:54 24  So in that paragraph, that was what I was trying to

08:23:56 25  describe.


                                                                355










08:23:57  1            However, we do know, based on the

08:24:00  2  testimony of Lee, that she did indeed leave the

08:24:07  3  detector stationary in multiple areas and it was

08:24:12  4  alarming.

08:24:13  5            MR. JARCHI:  Time, please?

08:24:14  6            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are over eight

08:24:16  7  hours.

08:24:16  8            MR. JARCHI:  Okay.  We're done.  I have a

08:24:19  9  couple questions.

08:24:19 10

08:24:19 11                       EXAMINATION

08:24:19 12  BY MR. JARCHI:

08:24:27 13        Q.  Dr. Galatsis, based on everything you

08:24:30 14  reviewed, was the pressure switch that was installed

08:24:35 15  in the DRO in 2002 effective at limiting the DRO to

08:24:40 16  9 parts per million CO as described by Nigel Mills?

08:24:45 17            MR. TAYAB:  Objection; form.

08:24:47 18            THE WITNESS:  No, it was not.

08:24:48 19  BY MR. JARCHI:

08:24:49 20        Q.  In addition to the opinions in your

08:24:50 21  declaration, are you also going to respond to the

08:24:58 22  testimony of the defense experts in this case?  Do

08:25:01 23  you anticipate doing that later on, depending on

08:25:03 24  what they say?

08:25:04 25        A.  Possibly.


                                                                356










08:25:04  1        Q.  Do you also include in your opinions that

08:25:06  2  you intend to offer opinions that you have offered

08:25:09  3  here today during your deposition as well?

08:25:12  4        A.  Can you repeat the question?

08:25:14  5        Q.  Sure.  In terms of your opinions at the

08:25:16  6  time of trial, may you also offer the opinions you

08:25:20  7  have offered here today in deposition at the time of

08:25:21  8  trial?

08:25:21  9        A.  Correct.

08:25:22 10            MR. JARCHI:  Okay.  I don't have anything

08:25:24 11  further?

08:25:24 12            MR. TAYAB:  Nothing further.  I'm out of

08:25:26 13  time.  And if you will indulge me with that

08:25:31 14  stipulation.

08:25:31 15            MR. JARCHI:  Sure.  No problem.

08:25:32 16            I propose the following stipulation --

08:25:35 17  actually, can we use the stipulation from another

08:25:40 18  depo that you took?

08:25:41 19            (Deposition reporter nodded.)

08:25:41 20            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the video

08:26:02 21  record.  The time is 8:25 p.m.

08:26:02 22            MR. JARCHI:  Can we agree to use the same

08:26:04 23  stipulation we used for Dr. Gill's deposition?

08:26:07 24            MR. TAYAB:  That's fine.

08:26:09 25            MR. JARCHI:  All right.  We're done.


                                                                357










          1            (Whereupon, the following stipulation

          2  agreed upon at the conclusion of the deposition of

          3  Joellen Gill, M.S. taken on August 9, 2019, was

          4  stipulated herein and is reprinted for reference; to

          5  wit:

08:37:15  6            "MR. JARCHI:  I propose the

08:37:15  7            following stipulation:  We're

08:37:17  8            going to relieve the court

08:37:17  9            reporter of her duties with

08:37:17 10            respect to signature of the

08:37:17 11            transcript; the transcript

08:37:17 12            will be prepared and sent

08:37:22 13            directly to my offices.

08:37:25 14            Actually, why don't we just

08:37:25 15            send it to you.

08:37:25 16            Send it to Ms. Gill's address.

08:37:33 17            I think that's on your CV?

08:37:38 18            THE WITNESS:  It is.

08:37:40 19            MR. JARCHI:  And she will

08:37:40 20            then review it, make changes,

08:37:42 21            if necessary, sign it, send

08:37:44 22            it back to me.

08:37:46 23            And I will notify -- she'll

08:37:48 24            have 30 days to do that and

08:37:50 25            I'll notify all counsel of


                                                                358










08:37:52  1            any changes, if any, in

08:37:53  2            writing, and if the original

08:37:56  3            transcript is lost, destroyed,

08:38:02  7            any and all purposes as if it

08:38:03  8            were the signed original.

08:38:04  9            I will maintain custody of

08:38:06 10            the original transcript and

08:38:07 11            make it available upon

08:38:08 12            reasonable request at the

08:38:11 14            So stipulate?

08:38:12 15            MR. NEWTON:  If that's the

08:38:12 16            stipulation that has been

08:38:14 17            stipulated to before, that

08:38:16 18            sounds --

08:38:16 19            MR. JARCHI:  I think it has

08:38:17 20            been.

08:38:32 21            MR. NEWTON:  Yeah, we agree

         22            on that basis."

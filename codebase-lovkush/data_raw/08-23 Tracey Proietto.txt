          11   BY MS. BILARDO:

          12   Q.     Hi.  My name is Patricia Bilardo and I represent

          13   Ms. Charles.  She's the other defendant that was named as

          14   a defendant in this lawsuit.  I know that you sat here and

          15   you heard some instructions that were given to the two

          16   other witnesses, but just so our record is clean, I'm

          17   going to give you some instructions.  Have you ever given

          18   a deposition before?

          19   A.     No.

          20   Q.     So this is really more for your benefit than anyone

          21   else's.  There's a court reporter seated to your right, at

          22   the end of the table.  His job is to literally take down

          23   every answer that you give and every question that I ask.

          24   In order for him to do that accurately, only one of us can

          25   talk at one time.
                                                                      5



           1                  I see that you nod your head.  He cannot

           2   put any verbal gestures onto the record.  So if there's a

           3   question that requires an answer, I ask that you just

           4   please give an answer.  If you forget to do that, I'll

           5   remind you.

           6                  Your attorney is seated to your left.  If

           7   at any time you need to speak with your attorney, use the

           8   restroom, get anything to drink, we can go off the record.

           9   You can do that.  The only thing that I do ask is that you

          10   answer the question that's currently pending, because it

          11   just makes it easier for the court reporter, so we don't

          12   have to all remember where we were.

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     And then take a break.

          15   A.     Okay.

          16   Q.     I'm gonna ask you -- just to give you a road map,

          17   I'm gonna ask you about your background first before we

          18   even get to the accident that we're here for today.

          19   A.     Okay.

          20   Q.     And all the answers that you give, we ask that you

          21   answer them to the best of your knowledge.  I'm not here

          22   to try to trick you, so if there's a question that I ask

          23   you and you do not understand the question, please don't

          24   answer it.  Just tell me, "I do not understand the

          25   question," because perhaps I can rephrase it in a way that
                                                                      6



           1   you can answer it.

           2                  And if there's something that you just

           3   don't know, that's okay as well.  But what happens

           4   afterwards is a little booklet gets prepared.  All the

           5   answers and the questions are in there.  And if you answer

           6   a question that you didn't understand, then it's not

           7   helpful to anyone, you know, at any other proceeding.

           8   A.     Okay.

           9   Q.     It's just better that you tell me that.

          10   A.     Okay.

          11   Q.     And if there's a question that I ask you in

          12   reference to speed, distance, or time, a lot of times,

          13   people wouldn't know the exact speed, the exact time, or

          14   the exact distance.  It's not as if you get out and

          15   measure.  But if you can give an approximate answer, then

          16   we ask that you do that.

          17                  But if you are giving an estimate, we ask

          18   that you say, "This is an estimate."  You know, this way

          19   it's clear to everyone here that you're estimating and

          20   that you're not saying that something is just true.

          21   A.     Okay.

          22   Q.     Okay?  So by way of background, what is your full

          23   name?  And if you could spell it, this way, the court

          24   reporter can make sure that we have it accurate.

          25   A.     Tracey, T-R-A-C-E-Y, A. Proietto, P-R-O-I-E-T-T-O.
                                                                      7



           1   Q.     What is your current home address?

           2   A.     63 Varnum Road, Norristown, PA 19403.

           3   Q.     And is that --

           4                  MR. BRANCA:  Could you spell the street for

           5   the reporter, please.

           6                  THE WITNESS:  63 Varnum, V as in Victor,

           7   A-R, N as in Nancy, U, M as in Mary, Road.

          17   Q.     Where do you work and how long have you been there?

          18   A.     Marshall Street Elementary School, which is the

          19   Norristown Area School District.  And I've been employed

          20   there approximately 19 years.

          21   Q.     And what is your highest level of education?

          22   A.     Montgomery County Community College, two years.

          23   Q.     Did you get an associate's degree there?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     And how old are you today?
                                                                      8



           1   A.     51.

           2   Q.     Where were you coming from at the time of the

           3   accident and where were you going, meaning what was your

           5   A.     63 Varnum Road.

           6   Q.     That's where you were coming from?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Where were you intending to go?

          10   Q.     Do you recall the date of the accident

          11   independently?  Like would you --

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     -- remember when it was?  When was it?

          14   A.     It was a Tuesday, I believe, approximately 12:20.

          15   Q.     In the afternoon?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     And the accident report indicates that it was on

          18   June 20 of 2017.  Does that seem correct?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     And when you said that you were going to work, was

          21   that the first time you'd been to work that day, or did

          22   you go to work, go home, and go back?

          23   A.     Went to work, went home, went back.  I went home to

          24   let -- we had had -- we have a new dog.  So I went home to

          25   let the dog out, which I did every day.
                                                                      9



           1   Q.     And do you get a certain lunchtime?

           2   A.     12:00 to 1:00.

           3   Q.     And do you have to adhere to that lunchtime,

           4   meaning you have to be back by 1:00 o'clock?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     How far is the school from your -- from where this

           7   accident --

           8   A.     Approximately --

           9   Q.     -- happened?

          10   A.     -- seven minutes.

          11   Q.     Was anyone else in the vehicle with you?

          12                  MR. BRANCA:  Just do me a favor.  I know

          13   you know sometimes what Counsel is gonna ask, but just let

          14   her finish her whole question before you answer, okay? so

          15   the court reporter -- otherwise, you'll make it hard on

          16   him, okay?

          17                  THE WITNESS:  I thought I was.  Sorry.

          18   BY MS. BILARDO:

          19   Q.     Was anyone else in the vehicle with you at the

          20   time?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     And are you familiar with the area where this

          23   happened?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     Do you travel that often?
                                                                     10



           1   A.     Very often.

           2   Q.     And how many days a week approximately, if you

           3   know?

           4   A.     That particular intersection, I probably go to at

           5   least three times a day.

           6   Q.     So I'm going to show you a picture that I printed

           7   out, and I believe that this may represent your direction

           8   of travel.  So take the time to look at it, and let me

           9   know if that is the case.

          10                  MS. PAUL:  Thank you.

          11                  MR. BRANCA:  You're welcome.

          12                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          13                  MS. BILARDO:  Okay.  So I'm gonna mark this

          14   as Exhibit 1.

          15                  (Exhibit 1 marked for identification.)

          16   BY MS. BILARDO:

          17   Q.     And can you describe the roadway that you're on at

          18   the time, meaning is it a two-way road, one-way road?

          19   Like the name of the road you're on, is that Schuylkill

          20   Road?

          21   A.     The name of the road I was on was -- yes, South

          22   Schuylkill Avenue.

          23   Q.     Does that run two-way, meaning traffic can come

          24   both ways?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     11



           1   Q.     And how many lanes are there each direction?

           2   A.     One.

           3   Q.     And the police report indicates that the accident

           4   occurred at the intersection of Schuylkill and Main

           5   Street.  Would that be accurate?

           6   A.     That's accurate.

           7   Q.     And on Main Street, how many lanes of travel are

           8   there total when you're talking about both directions of

           9   travel?

          10   A.     Four, I believe.

          11   Q.     And how many would that be each way?

          12   A.     Four each way -- two each way.

          13   Q.     What were the weather conditions like on the date

          14   of this accident?

          15   A.     Dry.

          16   Q.     Were the roads dry as well?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Was there any obstruction of your view when you

          19   entered this intersection, meaning could you see to your

          20   right and see to your left?

          21   A.     Yes, I could see to my right and I could see to my

          22   left.

          23   Q.     So was there any obstruction of view whatsoever?

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     When you approached the intersection, what color
                                                                     12



           1   was your light?

           2   A.     Green.

           3   Q.     Was there any other vehicle in front of you as you

           4   approached the intersection, or were you the first one?

           5   A.     I was the first one.

           6   Q.     How far back would you say were you when you

           7   observed that your light was green?  Like how many yards,

           8   feet were you --

           9   A.     Approximately -- approximately, a car length.

          10   Q.     So at one point as you're approaching the

          11   intersection, did you observe that your light was red?

          12   A.     Yeah.  I was at a complete stop.  I was at a

          13   complete stop at a red light before I proceeded through

          14   the intersection.

          15   Q.     So when you approached the light --

          16   A.     It was red.

          17   Q.     It was red.

          18   A.     I was at a complete stop.

          19   Q.     So prior to the accident happening, you were at a

          20   complete stop?

          21   A.     At a red light, yes.

          22   Q.     And at some point, it changed to green?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     How long did you wait between the time it changed

          25   from red to green to start going?
                                                                     13



           1   A.     Approximately, three to five seconds.

           2   Q.     And did you look to your left and your right before

           3   entering the intersection?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     Did you see any vehicles coming from your left or

           6   from your right?

           7   A.     I saw vehicles on my left, one in each lane.  They

           8   were at a complete stop on my left.  On my right, I saw

           9   one vehicle on the far side of the intersection, at a

          10   complete stop.

          11   Q.     And when you say "to the far side of the

          12   intersection" --

          13   A.     Curb -- like the curbside, the far curbside on Main

          14   Street.

          15   Q.     And that would be -- do you know north, south, east

          16   or west?  Do you know the directions?

          17   A.     I was traveling north.

          18   Q.     And I know what you're saying.  It's just that --

          19   A.     Yeah.

          20   Q.     -- I don't want --

          21   A.     It's okay.

          22   Q.     I don't want to put words in your mouth, so --

          23   A.     I was traveling north.  I know we didn't discuss

          24   this, but Ms. Gauger was traveling south on the opposite

          25   side of where I was.  I saw her as well.  So on my right
                                                                     14



           1   would be traveling west, I believe.

           2   Q.     That is correct.  I --

           3   A.     Yeah.

           4   Q.     I just wanted to make sure that --

           5   A.     West.

           6   Q.     -- we're all on the same page and -- in far as --

           7   so when you say you saw a vehicle stopped, I'm gonna show

           8   you a picture.

           9   A.     Okay.

          10                  MS. BILARDO:  We're gonna mark it as

          11   Exhibit 2.

          12                  (Exhibit 2 marked for identification.)

          13   BY MS. BILARDO:

          14   Q.     So I'm gonna show you another picture, and this

          15   would be a picture showing Main Street.  So just orient

          16   yourself with the picture before I ask you any questions.

          17   Do you recognize where that is?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     So when you say that you saw a vehicle stopped to

          20   your right, in the curb lane, do you recognize where that

          21   curb lane is in --

          22   A.     Right here.

          23   Q.     -- on Exhibit 2?  So you're pointing to where the

          24   bus is --

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     15



           1   Q.     -- in the photo?  What type of vehicle was that?

           2   Was that the vehicle that you had the accident with or --

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     -- was it another vehicle?

           5   A.     It was a -- it was a dark car, but I have no idea

           6   what it was or what color it was.  It was definitely a

           7   car.

           8   Q.     And when you looked to your right, did you see any

           9   other vehicles coming from your right on West Main Street?

          10   A.     Yes.  I saw the blue BMW.

          11   Q.     That would be to your left or to your right?

          12   A.     That was to my left.  They were in the -- they were

          13   in this lane right here.

          14   Q.     And you're pointing to --

          15   A.     The blue BMW was in this lane.

          16   Q.     You're pointing to the left lane?

          17   A.     Yes.  And then, there was also a vehicle -- make

          18   and model, I have no idea.  I just know this one was a BMW

          19   'cause it was a convertible, and it was down.  BMWs tend

          20   to catch your eye.  But yeah.  That was -- the BMW was

          21   here, and there was another vehicle stopped at a complete

          22   stop here.

          23   Q.     Pointing to the right lane --

          24   A.     Correct.

          25   Q.     -- on eastbound Main Street.  I'm just narrating --
                                                                     16



           1   A.     That's fine.

           2   Q.     -- for the record.

           3                  When you looked to your right, did you see

           4   any other vehicle aside from that vehicle that you

           5   mentioned that was at a complete stop --

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     -- in the far --

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.      -- right-hand lane?

          10                  Now, you sat here through the other

          11   depositions.  You had the opportunity to meet Ms. Charles.

          12   Did you see her vehicle at all --

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     -- prior to this accident?  Where was it when you

          15   saw it?

          16   A.     Directly across from me, in the -- would be the

          17   right-hand lane here.  But if I'm looking, it was in the

          18   left-hand lane.  It was right here.

          19   Q.     I'm talking about Ms. Charles, the one that just

          20   left.

          21   A.     Oh, Ms. Charles.  No, I didn't see her at all.

          22   Q.     Okay.  Did you --

          23   A.     I'm sorry.  I -- you said "Ms." -- I thought you

          24   said "Ms. Gauger."

          25   Q.     Ms. Charles.  Did -- no.  The woman that just left
                                                                     17



           1   --

           2   A.     Was Ms. Charles.

           3   Q.     -- was Ms. Charles.

           4   A.     I'm sorry.  I thought you said "Ms. Gauger."

           5   Q.     No.  That's okay.  Did you see her vehicle at

           6   all --

           7   A.     Not at all.

           8   Q.     -- prior to the accident?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     So what I'm gonna have you do is tell us, in your

          11   words, how the accident happened.  And then I'll back in

          12   from there the questions.  I think that might be a little

          13   bit easier.  Because of there being multiple vehicles --

          14   A.     Right.  Right.

          15   Q.     -- involved, you might be confusing the names of

          16   the parties.

          17   A.     Okay.

          18   Q.     Okay?  And if you could describe the vehicles in

          19   any way as you're talking about what happened, that would

          20   be helpful, either by color, whether it be an SUV.  Like

          21   you said "the blue convertible."

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     That's helpful for us to piece it all together.

          24   A.     Okay.  So I was traveling north on Schuylkill

          25   Avenue.  I was stopped at a red light.  The light changed
                                                                     18



           1   from red to green.  I proceeded through the intersection.

           2   And I felt impact and my airbag deployed.

           3   Q.     And after the accident happened, did you -- did you

           4   realize what had happened?

           5   A.     Well, I realized I was involved in a collision, but

           6   what exactly happened, no.  I honestly -- I didn't -- I

           7   didn't know what hit me.

           8   Q.     And I'm going to show you an exhibit that I'm going

           9   to mark as Exhibit 3.

          10                  (Exhibit 3 marked for identification.)

          11                  MR. BRANCA:  Thank you.

          12   BY MS. BILARDO:

          13   Q.     And I just handed you Exhibit No. 3.  Do you

          14   recognize what's in that photo?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     What is that a picture of?

          17   A.     My vehicle.

          18   Q.     And does that picture accurately represent how your

          19   vehicle looked after this accident happened?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     In that picture, it shows a front-end impact.  Was

          22   your vehicle impacted on the passenger side in any way?

          23   Like was there any impact to your passenger side?

          24   A.     I don't recall.

          25   Q.     Was there any impact to your driver's side?
                                                                     19



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     After the initial impact that you had where you

           3   said that your airbags deployed, did you hit anything

           4   else?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Did you only have one impact?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Did you see what happened next, or because your

           9   airbag deployed, you don't know?

          10   A.     I don't know.

          11   Q.     What do you recall next?

          12   A.     I recall my -- my car shutting down and then

          13   continuing straight, rolling right through the

          14   intersection, onto South Schuylkill Avenue, still in my

          15   lane.  And then it finally just came to a stop and died.

          16   It -- it just stopped.  It wasn't running.  It just, you

          17   know, rolled through and just stopped.

          18   Q.     Do you know what the speed limit is for you on

          19   Schuylkill Avenue in that area?

          20   A.     Twenty-five miles per hour.

          21   Q.     Do you know what your speed was approximately at

          22   the time of this accident?

          23   A.     I would say approximately six to eight miles an

          24   hour.

          25   Q.     After you got out of the vehicle, did you speak
                                                                     20



           1   with anyone else at the scene?

           2   A.     Well, I couldn't get out of the vehicle.  And the

           3   smoke -- I've never been in an accident, but the smoke

           4   from the airbag, I thought my car was on fire.  So I kind

           5   of panicked.

           6                  And there were two -- there was a

           7   gentleman.  I believe he was painting on that street,

           8   painting a house.  He got me out of my vehicle.  So he was

           9   the initial person that I spoke with, but I don't know his

          10   name or anything.  I just know he was doing -- I actually

          11   seen him there the -- the -- the couple days before that,

          12   doing -- doing work.

          13                  I believe he was painting or doing

          14   contractual work on a house.  He came -- he came to my car

          15   and got me out.  But he's the -- he's the person that I

          16   spoke with as soon as I got out of my car.

          17   Q.     After you did get out of the vehicle, do you recall

          18   speaking with any of the other drivers that were involved?

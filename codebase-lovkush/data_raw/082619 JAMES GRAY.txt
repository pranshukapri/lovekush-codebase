          15   BY MR. KELLY:

          16   Q.     Mr. Gray, would you state your name

          17   for the court reporter.

          18   A.     James Gray.

          19   Q.     Your address?

          20   A.     1726 Erlen Road, Elkins Park,

          21   Pennsylvania 19027.

          22   Q.     What's your date of birth?

          23   A.     7/8/65.

          24   Q.     Have you ever given a deposition

                                                            6



           1   before?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     A few instructions before we start.

           4   What's going to happen here is I'm going to

           5   ask you questions and you're going to answer.

           6   The court reporter is taking it down.

           7          It's important not to talk over each

           8   other.  It makes it difficult for the court

           9   reporter to take the question down.  Make

          10   sure you understand my question before you

          11   answer it.  If you don't, I'm glad to repeat

          12   it.  I don't want you to give an inaccurate

          13   answer.

          14          You can't answer uh-uh or uh-huh.  You

          15   have to say yes or no because the court

          16   reporter can't take that down, and we

          17   wouldn't know what you meant by it

          18   necessarily.

          19          Is there any reason today why you

          20   can't give a deposition?

          21          Are you on any kind of medication or

          22   disability or anything?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     If you need a break at any time, let

                                                            7



           1   me know, and we'll go from there.  I'm glad

           2   to wait, if you want to stop and talk to your

           3   attorney, that's fine.

           4          Mr. Gray, do you remember the accident

           5   we're here for today?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Do you remember the date?

           8   A.     No, I don't remember the date.

           9   Q.     If I said it was December 7, 2016,

          10   would you believe that's accurate?

          11   A.     I don't know.  I don't remember the

          12   date.

          13   Q.     About two years ago or so?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     Where were you going on that day, do

          16   you recall?

          17   A.     I was either going two places that I

          18   recall.  Either going to pick up a friend of

          19   mines or going to -- I think I was on my way

          20   to L&I.

          21   Q.     Where were you coming from?

          22   A.     My house.

          23   Q.     You were driving a company truck,

          24   correct?

                                                            8



           1   A.     Yeah, my car.  It was my car.

           2   Q.     Is it your company?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     What's the name of the company?

           5   A.     B-World Electrical Contractors.

           6   Q.     Are there any other owners of that

           7   company besides you?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     Were you using it for the purpose of

          10   work?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     You don't remember if you were going

          13   to L&I or somewhere else, right?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     What route did you take to the scene

          16   of the accident?

          17   A.     Where was I coming from?  Which way

          18   did I go?

          19   Q.     How did you get to the accident?

          20   A.     My normal route.  I go down Broad

          21   Street, get on at Tioga, take the expressway

          22   and go straight down to either 15th Street

          23   and get off, somewhere in there.

          24   Q.     Do you recall how fast you were going

                                                            9



           1   at the time of the accident?

           2   A.     Normal speed.

           3               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  I'm just going

           4   to object to the form.

           5               Do you mean at the moment of

           6   impact, or as he was traveling down the road

           7   before impact?

           8               MR. KELLY:  Let's say 30 seconds

           9   before impact.

          10               THE WITNESS:  Clearly, about 35,

          11   40, because it was kind of misty so everybody

          12   wasn't driving fast.

          13   BY MR. KELLY:

          14   Q.     What would you describe the traffic

          15   like that day; heavy, light, medium?

          16   A.     Medium, but not -- yeah, medium.

          17   Q.     How often did you travel on that part

          18   of -- you were on Route 1, correct?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     How often did you travel in that part

          21   of Route 1?

          22   A.     What do you mean?

          23   Q.     Did you do it every day?

          24   A.     Just about every day.

                                                           10



           1   Q.     For how long had you been doing it?

           2   A.     Years.

           3   Q.     What street were you approaching when

           4   the accident occurred, what cross street?

           5          You're on Route 1, correct?

           6   A.     No, we were on the expressway.  The

           7   last thing I remember is Fox when we pulled

           8   over.  So we were off of Route 1.  You turn

           9   off of Route 1 onto Tioga and then get to the

          10   expressway.

          11   Q.     Was there any traffic light ahead of

          12   you at the time?

          13   A.     No, no traffic lights involved.

          14   Q.     At some point prior to the accident,

          15   you were in the middle lane or the far-right

          16   lane?

          17          Was it three lanes in that direction

          18   that you were traveling?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Before the accident, what lane were

          21   you in?

          22   A.     The middle lane.

          23   Q.     Describe what happened from the time

          24   you were in that middle lane until the

                                                           11



           1   accident occurred.

           2   A.     What I remember is this; I was coming

           3   down and the car cut us off, cut me off.  It

           4   was a red truck in front of me.  I went to

           5   the far-right lane.  That car went this way,

           6   this way and shot.  I said, dang, he almost

           7   got me.

           8          I looked back into the middle lane.

           9   The gold car and a couple other cars are

          10   behind me.  I drive with my left hand.  I'm

          11   riding down.  I click.  I go over.  No one is

          12   there, but I see cars behind me, the gold car

          13   and everything.

          14          Like I said, we're going about 35, 40,

          15   because the day was like today and kind of

          16   drizzling.  I started drifting very slow

          17   over, and I heard a roar.  I turned around,

          18   and we both just kind of breezed over to the

          19   side.

          20   Q.     Was the red truck in front of you?

          21   A.     Red truck was gone.

          22   Q.     It was gone by that time?

          23   A.     Right.

          24   Q.     Why were you shifting to the far-left

                                                           12



           1   lane?

           2   A.     Because it was open.  That's the lane

           3   I normally stay in.  When I go down Route 1,

           4   I like to stay in that lane in case anything

           5   happen.  You can go right into that lane.  I

           6   never stay to the far right.

           7          I was going over slowly, and that's

           8   when I heard the roaring of the engine and

           9   scrape the side of my car.

          10   Q.     The accident occurred in what lane?

          11   A.     I was in the middle lane.  I never got

          12   over to the far left.

          13   Q.     Never got over?

          14   A.     Never got over.  I got about, I'll

          15   say, 30 to 40 percent into that lane.

          16   Q.     Your intention was to go to the far

          17   left lane, correct?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Why were you going to the far left

          20   lane?

          21   A.     That's the lane I always drive in

          22   because the openness.  There is another lane

          23   to the left of it.  Things happen.  I don't

          24   know if that lane is a state trooper lane

                                                           13



           1   that you can get into, get yourself out.  So

           2   I stay to the far left.  When I'm coming down

           3   back, I stay to the far right because it's

           4   got the other lane over there, too.

           5   Q.     You indicated that you looked behind

           6   you, and you didn't see any traffic?

           7   A.     No, I seen all the traffic.

           8   Q.     You saw all the traffic?

           9   A.     Yeah.  Again, I drive with my left

          10   hand.  I looked in my left mirror.  I clicked

          11   my turn signal.  I proceeded to go.  I seen

          12   all the cars behind me.

          13          As I said, I heard a car roar straight

          14   up to me.  I did like that.  I just heard a

          15   little hit and scratches.  I looked over and

          16   really seen that car.  We both just eased

          17   over.  We were going about 35, if that, maybe

          18   40.

          19   Q.     When is the first time you saw the car

          20   that you had the accident with?

          21   A.     It was like three or four cars behind

          22   me.

          23   Q.     You did see it at that point?

          24   A.     Yeah, I seen that car, another

           1   dark-colored car.

           2   Q.     When you saw that car three or four

           3   cars behind you, when you saw the car you had

           4   the accident with, what lane was it in?

           5   A.     I think it was right directly behind

           6   me.

           8   A.     Same lane as me.

           9   Q.     Were you in the process of making the

          10   turn at that time?

          12   off -- because I asked one of them, and they

          13   said, yeah, we seen it.  The red truck went,

          14   and we all was like this.  This lane was

          15   completely open.  I seen everybody right

          16   behind me.

          17          I'm telling you we drove for maybe a

          18   block or so.  Then I started going over.

          19   That's when felt that car come up.

          20   Q.     You said you looked out your mirror,

          21   you said your left mirror?

          22   A.     Right.

          23   Q.     Is that the side mirror?

          24   A.     The side.

          15   Q.     You say you drive with your left hand.

          16          What were you doing with your right

           1   I'd be lying if I said I didn't.  I wasn't

          12   Q.     It does have a rear-view window in the

          13   back; it's not a work van that has --

           5   when I started hearing stuff sound like a

          15   Q.     What was that conversation about?

          16   A.     I said to him, what happened?  Where

          17   were you going?  He said, we're trying to get

          18   to Washington.  He said I was telling him

          19   slow down, slow down, slow down.

          20          It was only one that spoke English,

          21   only one that ever said anything to me.  The

          22   one in the back of the car, he seemed like he

          23   was sickly.  He didn't even get out until the

          24   ambulance came, and I can remember he was on

                                                           21



           1   the phone and I was like --

           2               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  He, we're

           3   speaking about Mr. Nguyen?

           4               THE WITNESS:  Right.  He

           5   immediately jumped on the phone.  I did, too.

           6   I hope he was calling the police because I

           7   did, too.

           8               He said he was like, slow down,

           9   slow down.  Like I said, it was a younger

          10   one, a middle one and an older one.  The

          11   older one, he looked like he was sickly a

          12   little bit.  I don't want to say that, but

          13   that's what it looked like to me.  That was

          14   it.  That was basically it.

          15   BY MR. KELLY:

           1   Q.     You're identifying Mr. Pham?

          14   A.     In between.  It was just drizzling

          15   little bit.  It wasn't wet where you would

          16   have went hydroplaning or anything.

          17   Q.     Were you issued any kind of citations

          20   Q.     Did they give you any kind of

          21   warnings?

          23   Q.     Did the police indicate to you who

          24   they thought was at fault?

                                                           23



           1   A.     At that point, I didn't understand

           2   what they said.  He said I got them listed

           3   down as the striker.

           4   Q.     As the striker?

           5   A.     That was his exact words.

           6   Q.     How long were you at the scene, do you

           7   recall?

           8   A.     About 30, 40 minutes.

           9   Q.     Where did you go after that, if you

          10   recall?

          11   A.     I got on the phone with a guy named

          12   Sherman.  That's when he took me to his

          13   lawyer house.  I said, listen, man.  He said

          14   you better go.  You don't know what's going

          15   to happen to you.  So we went downtown

          16   somewhere.

          17          He told me you better go to the

          18   hospital and make sure.  I said I'm not hurt.

          19   We barely touched each other.  I said I'm not

          20   hurt.  Then that was that.

          21          Then I think I proceeded to go to L&I,

          22   or I probably -- after that, things go blank.

          23   After that day, it goes blank.  I don't

          24   remember too much after that.

                                                           24



           1   Q.     What you did the rest of the day?

           2   A.     Yeah.  Did I go to L&I?  Did I go to

           3   south Philly to my buddy's house?  I don't

           4   know.

           5   Q.     Do you recall if at any time you hit

           6   your brakes?

           7   A.     Yes.  When I heard them, when I heard

           8   the screeching, that's why I slowed down, hit

           9   my brakes and we both went over to the right.

          10   Q.     When you both went over to the right?

          11   A.     No, I know I went over to the right,

          12   and then we all landed up over there.

          13   Q.     All the way to the right, you went,

          14   not to the left?

          15   A.     Yeah, to the right.

          16   Q.     When you went all the way to the

          17   right, whose car was in front; yours or the

          18   other vehicle?  Were you behind them or in

          19   front of them?

          20   A.     I don't remember that.

          21   Q.     You don't remember?

          22   A.     No.

          23               MR. KELLY:  I have no other

          24   questions.

           2                    EXAMINATION

           3                       - - -

           4   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

           5   Q.     Mr. Gray, thank you for being here

           6   today.  I don't have much.  Just a couple of

           7   clarifications that I would like from you.

           8          First, the points of impact.  Let's

           9   talk about the damages that your vehicle

          10   sustained.

          11          To what areas was your vehicle

          12   damaged?

          13   A.     The back bumper had had a little

          14   crack.

          15   Q.     What side?

          16   A.     The left side.

          17               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  The driver's

          18   side.

          19               THE WITNESS:  Driver's side.

          20   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

          21   Q.     Back bumper?

          22   A.     Scrape from there, and the bigger

          23   impact was on the side door.

          24   Q.     Passenger or driver's door?

                                                           26



           1   A.     Driver's rear door, not the front.

           2   It's like a minivan.  The side that opened.

           3               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  The rear slider

           4   on the driver's side?

           5               THE WITNESS:  Yeah, right where

           6   the right handle is at.

           7   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

           8   Q.     The vehicle that you were involved in

           9   the accident with, where did that vehicle

          10   sustain damage?

          11   A.     I just told you.

          12   Q.     The other car.

          13   A.     From what I seen, it was the front

          14   right passenger, front fender and it seemed

          15   like it was the mirror.

          16   Q.     Which mirror?

          17   A.     The passenger mirror.

          18   Q.     You indicated that you saw Mr. Nguyen

          19   on a phone?

          20   A.     Him?

          21   Q.     Yes, next to me.

          22   A.     After we got out, he just got on the

          23   phone.

          24   Q.     That was after you had gotten to the

                                                           27



           1   accident?

           2   A.     Yeah.  Again, he asked me who I was

           3   talking to.  I was talking to him.  He was on

           4   the phone, and there was another one in the

           5   back of the car.

           6               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Indicating

           7   Mr. Pham.

           8               MR. KELLY:  Mr. Pham, he was

           9   talking to.

          10               THE WITNESS:  That's when

          11   everything was over.  I don't know if he was

          12   on the phone when we were driving.  I

          13   couldn't see.

          14   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

          15   Q.     You just saw Mr. Nguyen after the

          16   accident?

          17   A.     After everything happened, only one

          18   person spoke to me, and that was him.

          19               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Mr. Pham.

          20               THE WITNESS:  No one else spoke

          21   to me.

          22   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

          23   Q.     Did you see Mr. Pham on the phone at

          24   any point after the accident?

                                                           28



           1   A.     Yes, after the accident.

           2   Q.     This is Mr. Pham.  This is Mr. Nguyen.

           3   A.     No, I didn't see him on a phone.

           4               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Mr. Pham was not

           5   on the phone.

           6   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

           7   Q.     You and Mr. Pham were speaking?

           8   A.     Right.

           9   Q.     You and Mr. Nguyen did not speak?

          10   A.     At all.

          11   Q.     But Mr. Nguyen was on the phone after

          12   everything happened?

          13   A.     Yes, because he never said nothing to

          14   me.

          15   Q.     Did you see Mr. Nguyen on the phone?

          16   A.     Which one is Mr. Nguyen?

          17   Q.     Right here.  The driver.

          18          Did you see Mr. Nguyen on the phone

          19   before the accident happened?

          20   A.     No.  I told you I couldn't see in his

          21   car.  I just know I saw cars behind me.

          22   Q.     After the accident, you both went over

          23   to the right lane?

          24   A.     That's where we ended up at.  That's

                                                           29



           1   what I remember.  We all ended up out of

           2   harm's way, and harm's way was to the right.

           3   Q.     Is there a reason why you weren't on

           4   the left?  You said there was a shoulder on

           5   the left lane.

           6          Is there a reason you didn't merge

           7   into the left lane after the accident?

           8   A.     When you go there, you'll see both

           9   sides.  That was the more safe.  At that

          10   point where we were at, that was the more

          11   safer side if you were trying to get off the

          12   road.  If I can remember, that's where we

          13   was.  I think that's where we was, to the

          14   right.

          15   Q.     Just one more for the record.  If you

          16   could, just break it down a little bit how

          17   the accident occurred.

          18          About a minute before the accident,

          19   you were traveling in the middle lane of

          20   Roosevelt Boulevard?

          21   A.     Again, I was in the middle lane.  A

          22   car cut me off.

          23   Q.     What color was that car?

          24   A.     A dark-colored car.  There was a white

                                                           30



           1   car, his car, other cars behind me.  I even

           2   asked him.  I said did you see what just

           3   happened.  He told me yes.

           4          I cut over to the right lane.  There

           5   was a red truck.  I cut back over to the

           6   middle lane.  The red truck was gone.  We

           7   drove about a block.  Everything was clear.

           8   I drive with my left hand.  I clicked my turn

           9   signal.  I looked.  I went slowly over.

          10   That's when I heard the engine, and that's

          11   when we both went over.  I could tell you

          12   that 20 years from now, same thing.

          13   Q.     When you say you went slowly over, can

          14   you give an estimate how fast you were

          15   driving?

          16   A.     Like I said, 35, 40, maybe under that

          17   because it's 55 or 50 on that and everybody

          18   was going slower than normal speed.

          19   Q.     You were in the middle lane about a

          20   minute before the accident.

          21          There is a dark car in front of you

          22   and it cuts you off?

          23   A.     No.  Again, that happened before I was

          24   in the middle.  That happened before the

                                                           31



           1   accident, way before the accident.

           2          Again, I jumped in the middle lane.

           3   We drove about a block.  It was about a good

           4   distance.  The red truck was gone and the

           5   black car that shot past everybody, the

           6   dark-colored car.

           7          That's, again, when I started

           8   proceeding over to the left lane.  I heard

           9   the boom, boom, boom, and I turned over.

          10   Q.     Is there a reason that you proceed

          11   into the left lane?

          12   A.     Again, that's the lane I like to drive

          13   in.  I do 76.  I do that route almost every

          14   day.  If I'm going back the other way, I'll

          15   be on the other far-right lane.

          16   Q.     When was the first time that you saw

          17   the vehicle that you were involved in an

          18   accident with?

          19   A.     First time I saw it?

          20   Q.     Yes, prior to impact.

          21   A.     Again, as that car cut in front of me,

          22   I seen a white car behind me.  I seen that

          23   car and other cars.  The only reason I seen

          24   that car was because that car was directly

                                                           32



           1   behind me.  When I went to go this way,

           2   that's when I felt that car coming up behind

           3   me.

           4   Q.     You first saw the car you were

           5   involved in the accident with when you were

           6   in the middle lane?

           7   A.     When I was coming down --

           8   Q.     In which lane?

           9   A.     In the middle lane.  The car cut me

          10   off.  I jumped into the right lane.  When

          11   that car got past that, it was a red truck in

          12   front of me.  I went back to the middle lane.

          13   The red truck went about a block.

          14          Everybody was behind me.  Everything

          15   to the right and left of me was clear.  My

          16   antennas was up.  Clicked my turn signal, and

          17   that's when I proceeded slowly.  That's what

          18   happened.  I said, did you see that car, what

          19   happened?  He told me yes.

          20   Q.     You asked him, meaning Mr. Pham?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Can you estimate how many car lengths

          23   away the car that you were involved in the

          24   accident was when you saw them?

                                                           33



           1   A.     Three to four car lengths.

           2               MS. KATHOPOULIS:  I think that

           3   should be all for me.

           7   BY MR. KELLY:

           8   Q.     You indicated you looked into your

           9   mirror.

          10          This was before you started to turn?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Did you also turn your head at any

          13   point to look?

          14   A.     No?  Where?  For what?

          15   Q.     You didn't turn your head to the left

          16   in addition?

          17   A.     Click, click, and my eyes went from

          18   here to there.

          19   Q.     You didn't --

          20   A.     No.  No reason to do that.

          21   Q.     Have you received any medical

          22   treatment as a result of the accident?

          23   A.     Yes.  Like I said, I left there and

          24   went down to somewhere on 9th in south

                                                           34



           1   Philly.  I went there about twice.  That was

           2   it.  The lawyer called me about this case.  I

           3   said I really wasn't hurt at all.  I didn't

           4   go back.  He said, well, I'm dropping you.  I

           5   said okay.  I didn't think nothing of it.

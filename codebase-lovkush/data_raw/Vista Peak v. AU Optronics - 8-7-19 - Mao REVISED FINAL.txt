16   on any display type technology.
17       A.  May I clarify that?  When I talk to

18       Q.  What type of training did you receive in 
19   Taiwan when you were an employee of AUO America?
20       A.  Would you please clarify the question?  You 
21   asked about what type, so what type of what?

23   trained in when you went to Taiwan as an employee of 
24   AUO America?
25       A.  Mainly related to AUO ARC's internal

 1   training to introduce all internal projects among 
 2   ARC.
 3       Q.  Was it technical training?
 4       A.  How do you define what is a technical 
 5   training?
 6       Q.  Was the training that you received with

 8   on, or was it more procedural in nature regarding 
 9   the policies and procedures of the ARC?

12   technologies.

14       Q.  Did you receive any training in the area of

16       A.  May I ask did you mean during the time when 
17   I worked for AUO America?

19       A.  The training I received was mainly related 
20   to nondisplay application to be used to use the TFT 
21   process to develop nondisplay products.
22       Q.  Okay.  But as an AUO America employee you

 1           THE WITNESS:  I don't quite understand this 
 2   question.  Would you please clarify?
 3   BY MR. SAAD:

 5   "nondisplay applications"?
 6       A.  Yes.
 7           For instance, if we have LCD plus a monitor 
 8   it will be a LCD monitor.  However, when we're 
 9   talking about nondisplay application just like what 
10   my current project is doing, which is a bio chip.
11           So this project does not involve any color 
12   filter display components.
13           CHECK INTERPRETER: May the interpreter 
14   clarify that?  
15           "If you add LCD display to -- LCD to a 
16   display it becomes a monitor.  Nondisplay 
17   application means that -- which I'm working on, 
18   which is the bio chip, has no LCD or color filter 
19   components."

 2   Corporation; correct?
 3       A.  Yes.
 4       Q.  Do any other AU Vista employees report 
 5   directly to Tung Tsun?
 6           MS. WANG:  Objection to form.
 7           CHECK INTERPRETER:  May the interpreter 
 8   clarify that rendition?  I think it was Tung Tsun 
 9   rather than Han Sheng.

10       Q.  As an AUO America employee did you travel to

 3       Q.  Can you give me your best guess?
 4       A.  Because their names are Taiwanese

0042
 1   is in your LinkedIn profile?
 2       A.  Yes.
 3       Q.  And do you believe that the information in 
 4   your LinkedIn profile is accurate?
 5       A.  No.
 6       Q.  What is inaccurate about it?
 7       A.  The account was written when I first joined 
 8   AUO America, hence some technical words in my 
 9   profile was not correct.
10       Q.  When was the last time that you updated your 
11   LinkedIn profile?

13   five to six years.
14       Q.  As part of the description of your work in 
15   your LinkedIn profile you state that you... 
16   "collaborate with AUO system design team and 
17   electrical engineering team and material process 
18   team to qualify and develop LCD display technology 
19   and TFT process."
20           Is that an accurate statement?

22           THE WITNESS:  No.
23   BY MR. SAAD:

25   that you authored it?

13           THE WITNESS:  No.
14   BY MR. SAAD:
15       Q.  What is inaccurate about it?
16       A.  At that time I just joined the company not 
17   too long ago, and I did not distinguish the 
18   technologies that well at the time.  Actually, those 
19   technologies related to ARC technologies were all 
20   for nondisplay application.  So we should remove the 
21   term "LCD" in those description.
22       Q.  What do you mean by the term "qualify"?
23       A.  I can't remember clearly it was so long ago.
24       Q.  That's not a term that you use in your 
25   everyday work?
0044
 1       A.  I don't quite understand your question.  So 
 2   what are you referring to now?
 3       Q.  I'm referring to the term "qualify" and 
 4   whether that is something that is -- has ever been 
 5   part of your job responsibilities.  To qualify a 
 6   technology, what does that mean?
 7           MS. WANG:  Objection to form.
 8           THE WITNESS:  I still don't quite understand 
 9   the question.  Would you further clarify the 
10   question?  Because that happened so long ago I don't 
11   remember that so clearly.
12   BY MR. SAAD:
13       Q.  Okay.  So you don't understand or have any 
14   understanding of what you meant by the term 
15   "qualify" in your LinkedIn profile?
16       A.  I don't recall the purpose that I stated 
17   that sentence at the time.
18       Q.  Okay.  You also state as part of your job 
19   responsibilities in your LinkedIn profile that you 
20   worked as a -- as "primary technical contact window 
21   to deliver display solution to U.S. partners and 
22   support project for final mass production need."
23           Is that an accurate statement about the work 
24   that you've ever done?

20   are your responsibilities when you attend these 
21   conferences or trade shows?

 2   a R & D engineer that is responsible for developing 
 3   prototypes.

14           MR. SAAD:  Can we go off the record and 
15   discuss?
16           MS. WANG:  Sure.

 6   department a memorandum telling you to retain 
 7   certain types of documents related to certain

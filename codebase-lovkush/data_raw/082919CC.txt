            8                   MR. SAVINELLI:  That's fine with me.

           18    BY MR. MANARA:

           19    Q.      Good afternoon, Ms. Callaway.

           20    A.      Hi, good afternoon.

           21    Q.      My name is Michael Manara.  I represent Mr.

           22    Kelly for an accident that occurred on April 3rd of

           23    2017; does that sound about right?

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                      5




            1    Q.      We are here today to take your deposition.

            2    A.      Okay.

            3    Q.      Have you ever been deposed before?

            4    A.      I have not.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   So a couple ground rules kind of before

            7    we begin.  One, a deposition is simply a question and

            8    answer session.  It's not designed to trick or confuse

            9    you.  We're simply trying to find out what happened,

           10    okay?

           11    A.      Okay.

           12    Q.      So a couple of ground rules for this

           13    deposition.  One, I need you to answer verbally because

           14    as you can see there's a court reporter here and she is

           15    typing down everything we say so she can't take down

           16    any hand gestures or head nods or anything like that;

           17    is that fair?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      All right.

           20                   Second, uh-huh and uh-uh read the exact

           21    same way on the record.  So if we correct you and say

           22    is that a yes, is that a no, we're not doing it to be

           23    jerks, we're just trying to make sure the record is

           24    clear, all right?

                                                                      6




            1    A.      Okay.

            2    Q.      Third, simultaneous speaking while it's human

            3    nature you'll probably understand where I'm headed with

            4    my question, it's way too difficult for her to take

            5    down two people speaking at the same time.  So I ask

            6    that you allow me to finish my question before you

            7    answer.  I'll allow you to finish your answer before I

            8    ask my next question and we'll go back and forth in

            9    that cadence; is that fair?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      All right.

           12                   Fourth, if at any time I'm speaking too

           13    fast or you do not understand the question, please let

           14    me know and I will be happy to rephrase.  Because if

           15    you answer my question I will assume two very important

           16    things, first, that you understood the question and

           17    second, that the answer is the truth; is that fair?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Do you understand that the oath that you just

           20    took is the exact same oath you would take in a

           21    courtroom?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      All right.

           24                   Did you understand the instructions

                                                                      7




            1    that I have given?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      We are here today to discuss essentially three

            4    things.  One, the accident that occurred.  Two, the

            5    injuries you're claiming.  And three, any affects on

            6    your life.  Is there any reason you can't discuss those

            7    three things with me here today?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      All right.

           10                   Are you understand the influence of any

           11    medications or substance that would prevent you from

           12    understanding my questions?

           13    A.      No.

           14    Q.      State your full name, please.

           15    A.      Connie Elbella Callaway.

           16    Q.      Ever gone by any other names?

           17    A.      My maiden name, Connie Foulks, F-O-U-L-K-S.

           18    Q.      All right.

           19                   Prior to your deposition did you review

           20    any documents?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      What did you look at?

           23    A.      The answers I gave to the --

           24    Q.      Interrogatory questions?

                                                                      8




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   Anything else?

            4    A.      No.

            5    Q.      Any medical records, police reports, anything

            6    like that?

            7    A.      No.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Other than your attorney did you

           10    discuss your deposition testimony with anybody else?

           11    A.      The secretary but I guess that's the same.

           12    Q.      Other than somebody in your attorney's office?

           13    A.      No.

           15                   (Whereupon, a brief discussion was held

           16    off the record.)

           19    Q.      Ma'am, off the record I asked you what your

           20    Social Security number was and I read it back to you

           21    and you confirmed that it was correct; is that fair?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      What's your date of birth?

           13    A.      South Carolina, Maryland, Nevada.  I believe

           14    that's it.

           15    Q.      South Carolina, Maryland and Nevada, any of

           16    those licenses --

           17    A.      Oh, North Carolina, sorry.

           18    Q.      No worries.

           19                   South Carolina, North Carolina,

           20    Maryland, Nevada, have any of those licenses ever been

           21    suspended or revoked?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      For what and which state?

           24    A.      I think it was my South Carolina license.  I

                                                                      11




            1    forgot to pay a seatbelt ticket and it was suspended

            2    for like 2 days until I paid it.

            3    Q.      When was that -- was it a long time ago?

            4    A.      It was.  It was in like 2005, I believe.

            5    Q.      That suspension was lifted then?

            6    A.      Oh, yes, yes.

            7    Q.      Recognizing that this particular card that you

            8    have given me was not valid on the date of the

            9    accident, did you have a valid Pennsylvania license on

           10    the date of the accident?

           11    A.      So I think -- so that card is a duplicate.

           12    That wasn't the first time I got issued in

           13    Pennsylvania.

           14    Q.      Sure.

           15    A.      But I do believe at the time of the accident I

           16    had a Pennsylvania license.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18    A.      I do believe, yes.

           19    Q.      Fair to say valid?

           20    A.      Yes, yes, sir.

           23    Is that where you currently live?

           19    A.      Yeah, two different agencies, yes, sir.

           20    Q.      And we're talking like a 9:00 to 5:00ish or

           21    9:00 to 6:00 or was it nighttime or you tell me?

           22    A.      So some of my cases were during the day and

           23    they would be from like 8:30 to 2:30.  And then I would

           24    have some in the evenings that might start at 4:00 to

                                                                      21




            1    7:00 or 4:00 to 8:00.

            2    Q.      What was the time period that you worked at

            3    those two agencies, Kids and Family and Epic

            4    Developmental.

            5    A.      So with Kids and Family my case started at

            6    8:30 a.m.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8    A.      Oh, I'm sorry.

            9    Q.      Time period, meaning --

           10    A.      I apologize.  So for Kids and Family I started

           11    November of 2016.

           12    Q.      And Epic Developmental when did you start?

           13    A.      February of 2017.

           14    Q.      Kids and Family when did you stop working at

           15    Kids and Family?

           16    A.      So my last case with them was June of 2019 for

           17    Kids and Family.  And for Epic Developmental it was

           18    April of 2019.

           19    Q.      Why did you stop at Kids and Family?

           20    A.      So I was a contractor and I would just pick up

           21    cases along the way.  I most recently left my last case

           22    because it was summertime.  So the way the program

           23    works it goes during the school year and in the summer

           24    months not all kids IEP handle a summer case so...

                                                                      22




            1    Q.      Fair to say you did not stop at Kids and

            2    Family or Epic Developmental as a result of this

            3    accident?

            4    A.      So the case that I actually had with Kids and

            5    Family I did leave due to the accident.

            6    Q.      What case was that?

            7    A.      It was the case located at 22nd and Lehigh.

            8    Q.      When did you start that case?

            9    A.      November of 2016.

           10    Q.      When did you stop?

           11    A.      I left I think around May of 2017.

           12    Q.      So about a month after the accident?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      Why did you stop?

           15    A.      Just driving in that area I didn't want to go

           16    back over there.

           17    Q.      So it was because of driving?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Like I said, I just want to make sure it's

           20    clear.  So you had a case with Kids and Family that was

           21    located around 22nd and Lehigh; is that fair?

           22    A.      Correct.

           23    Q.      And you worked with that case -- is that one

           24    child that case?

                                                                      23




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      You worked with that one child from November,

            3    2016 to May of 2017?

            4    A.      Correct.

            5    Q.      And you stopped in May of 2017 about a month

            6    after this accident because you didn't like driving in

            7    that area?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Any other reason you stopped?

           10    A.      No.

           11    Q.      Did you stop any cases at Epic Developmental

           12    as a result of this accident?

           13    A.      No.

           14    Q.      And can I ask what about driving in the area

           15    that made you stop?

           16    A.      It was just the anxiety from going down that

           17    -- because that was the direction I would take everyday

           18    to go home and just driving down the road afterwards I

           19    just --

           20    Q.      Did you ever see anybody to treat for anxiety?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Who did you see?

           23    A.      Stephanie Monstone she's my -- she was my

           24    general practitioner.

            1    Q.      Can you spell Monstone?

            5    left May of this year.

            6    Q.      Is that your primary care physician?

            7    A.      It is.

            8    Q.      Well, let me ask you this, my understanding is

            9    you left both Kids and Family and Epic Developmental

           10    because your contract ended and it was seasonal, right,

           11    in this year, 2019?

           12    A.      Correct, so technically I guess I'm still

           13    employed with Kids and Family.  I can pick up a case

           14    when school starts back.  But with Epic Developmental I

           15    left them in April.

           16    Q.      Do you intend to pick up any cases with Kids

           17    and Family?

           18    A.      I probably will do some cases, yes.

           19    Q.      Would that be on top of your job with the

           20    insurance company?

           21    A.      Yes, sir.

           22    Q.      Did you have any other jobs at the time of the

           23    accident?

           24    A.      I did not.

                                                                      25




            1    Q.      Did you have any other jobs before the

            2    accident that you stopped as a result of the accident?

            3    A.      No.

            4    Q.      Did you miss any work at Kids and Family or

            5    Epic Developmental as a result of the accident?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      How much did you miss?

            8    A.      Just the day.

            9    Q.      From which one?

           10    A.      So the day of the accident I did not go to my

           11    case at Epic Developmental.  And then following I

           12    missed like a day with the case at Kids and Family.

           13    Q.      So it's your understanding it would be the day

           14    of the accident and the next day?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      And those are the two days you missed?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Did any doctor put you on any work

           19    restriction?

           20    A.      So my chiropractor -- I wouldn't say it was a

           21    work restriction but he did give me some instructions.

           22    Q.      Were those instructions written?

           23    A.      He did provide me written instructions as far

           24    as things to do and things to avoid.

            1    Q.      I understand that.  But did he give you a

            2    written instruction or restrictions --

            3    A.      No.

            4    Q.      -- saying that you can't --

            5    A.      No, sir.

            6    Q.      Were you compensated for those two days?

            7    A.      No.

            8    Q.      How much money did you miss in those two days

           21    Q.      All right.

           22                   Discussing this accident, my

           23    understanding is it happened on April 3rd, 2017; does

           24    that sound about right?

           22    A.      There's a stop sign.

           23    Q.      Stop sign?

           24    A.      Yes, sir.

                                                                      44

            9    Q.      Do you know which direction that heads?

           10    A.      I just know I can only make a left onto

           11    Clearfield.

           12    Q.      So that would be westbound?

           13    A.      Probably.

           14    Q.      How fast were you going at the time of the

           15    impact?

           16    A.      Maybe 10 miles an hour.  I had just stopped so

           17    I was just starting to accelerate.

           18    Q.      So you were pulling from a stop sign?

           19    A.      Yes, sir.

           23    Q.      Do you know what the speed limit is on 25th

           24    Street?

                                                                      45




            1    A.      I do not.

            2    Q.      Were you the driver of your car?

            3    A.      I was.

            4    Q.      Anybody else in the car?

            5    A.      No.

            6    Q.      Were you wearing your seatbelt?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Tell me how the accident happened in your own

            9    words?

           10    A.      I was going north on 25th.  And I approached

           11    the stop sign, stopped to make a left, the gentleman

           12    that was behind me in the black Jeep -- I'm sorry.

           13    When I stopped at a stop sign there was a car on

           14    Clearfield that had the right of way and I stopped to

           15    allow them to go.  Once they went through I went to

           16    proceed to go make a left turn and the gentleman came

           17    from behind me on my left and we made impact in the

           18    intersection.

           19    Q.      All right.

           20                   Was it your intention to go straight or

           21    turn left?

           22    A.      Turn left.

           23    Q.      Did you have your turn signal on?

           24    A.      I did.

                                                                      46




            1    Q.      Your understanding is my client's car was to

            2    the left of yours?

            3    A.      When we made impact?

            4    Q.      Yes.

            5    A.      At impact it was, prior to it he was behind

            6    me.

            7    Q.      So there was space on the left-hand side of

            8    your car?

            9    A.      Yes, because of the fire hydrant so no parking

           10    there.  Prior to the stop sign there was cars on both

           11    sides.

           12    Q.      Where did the impact happen in the

           13    intersection?

           14    A.      In the intersection.

           15    Q.      Meaning, it would have happened on Clearfield

           16    Street?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Did you see my client's car at all to the left

           19    of you before the impact?

           20    A.      No.

           21    Q.      When was the last time you saw my client's car

           22    before the impact?

           23    A.      Before I proceeded to make the left.

           24    Q.      So maybe it might be easier, the last time you

                                                                      47




            1    saw my client's car you were stopped at the stop sign;

            2    is that fair?

            3    A.      Yes, sir, uh-huh.

            4    Q.      Is that a yes?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      And you didn't see it again until the impact?

            7    A.      Correct.

            8    Q.      And fair to say when you saw it behind you was

            9    that in your rearview mirror or were you turned around?

           10    A.      My rearview.

           11    Q.      How would you describe the severity of the

           12    impact?

           13    A.      Startling, I mean, it was a jolt, I guess.  It

           14    wasn't so much that -- I'm sorry, I don't know how to

           15    describe --

           16    Q.      As best you can.  I was not there so I just

           17    want to know --

           18    A.      So the impact it was more of a jolt, it was

           19    startling.  But it wasn't as minor as if we both were

           20    stopped and just kind of tapped, you know.  So it was

           21    more severe than that.

           22    Q.      More than a tap?

           23    A.      Yes, sir.

           24    Q.      So you would describe the impact as more than

                                                                      48




            1    a tap?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Who do you believe caused the accident?

            4    A.      The gentleman behind me.

            5    Q.      Do you believe you did anything wrong?

            6    A.      That I did anything wrong?

            7    Q.      Yes.

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      I believe you already said this, after you saw

           10    my client's car behind you you never saw it until the

           11    time of impact?

           12    A.      Yes, sir.

           13    Q.      When you saw my client's car was he stopped as

           14    well?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      When you saw my client's car behind you was he

           17    stopped as well?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      When you first say my client's car behind you

           20    was it directly behind you or more to your left or more

           21    to your right?

           22    A.      He was directly behind me.

           23    Q.      On 25th Street --

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                      49




            1    Q.      -- were you more to the right, to the middle

            2    or to the left when you stopped at the stop sign?

            3    A.      So I actually moved slightly to the left to

            4    stop only because he seemed in a hurry.  That's why I

            5    noticed him because he was tailgating me.  So I

            6    slightly moved to the left so that I can make a left

            7    turn since I had my signal that way if he did want to

            8    proceed, you know, he can go to my right.  So I did

            9    stop slightly to the left.

           10    Q.      Now, my understanding is looking at pictures

           11    of 25th Street that four cars can actually fit across

           12    including parking cars; is that not your understanding?

           13    A.      So every time I've driven up it's also been

           14    just one car.  Again, I'm sure there's space that

           15    people could probably go around but there's always been

           16    just that one car.

           17    Q.      At the time of the accident what were you

           18    doing at the time of the impact while you were driving?

           19    A.      I'm sorry?

           20    Q.      Meaning, were you listening to the radio?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Were you on your cell phone?

           23    A.      I was not.

           24    Q.      Did you need a GPS?

                                                                      50




            1    A.      No.

            2    Q.      What's your cell phone number?

            3    A.      (704) 430-6135.

            4    Q.      Who is your carrier?

            5    A.      T-Mobile.

            6    Q.      Did you do anything to avoid the accident?

            7    A.      No, I didn't.  It just happened so quick so

            8    no.

            9    Q.      You indicated that you were going to say you

           10    didn't see or what were you going to say?

           11    A.      I didn't have time to do anything at that

           12    point.  Like I said, the first time I saw him as he

           13    dipped around we made impact so...

           14    Q.      Where did the cars end up after the accident?

           15    A.      We moved them across to the opposite side of

           16    25th.

           17    Q.      Cars drivable?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      All right.

           20                   Can you describe the area of impact to

            1    witnesses, neither of us had any.  Mr. Kelly stated,

            2    you know, he apologized.  He was like he's sorry, he

            3    wasn't paying attention.  The cop talked to us then

            4    separately.  They took separate statements.  And they

           11    Q.      Did anybody at Marini Chiropractic give you a

           17    what I did with certain things because he knew I worked

           18    with kids so as far as the lifting and that kind of

           19    thing.

           20    Q.      It sounds like for this accident you stopped

            1    A.      Yes, I would go for follow-up visits.

            2    Q.      Did that trail off like you were going before

            3    the accident?

            4    A.      It started out where I would go more than

            5    before the accident but then it eventually went back to

            6    -- yes, I was going only like once.  I was going once

            7    every couple of months.

            8    Q.      When did you start going once a month, once

            9    every couple of months, when was that?

           10    A.      Maybe a couple of months after May.  So I went

           11    for a couple times a month for a few months after the

           12    accident.  And then maybe Fall about Fall of that year

           13    I would go back to my usual visit.

            4    her.

            5    Q.      When you got to Doctor Monstone what were your

            6    complaints?

            7    A.      So I was seeing her for the anxiety.

            8    Q.      Anything else?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Did Doctor Marini prescribe you any

           12    medication for your anxiety?

           13    A.      No, that's why he sent me to Stephanie.

           14    Q.      I'm sorry, Doctor Monstone --

           15    A.      Oh, sorry.

           16    Q.      I apologize, your primary care doctor did they

           17    prescribe you any medication for that anxiety?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      What type of medication is that?

           20    A.      Again, I did not get it filled the first --

           21    but I do believe it was -- what is it called, I know

           22    it's common.  It's similar to Valium but I don't know

           23    the exact name for it.

           24    Q.      You just never got it filled?

                                                                      72




            1    A.      No, not the first time.  She prescribed it and

            2    I did get it filled.  I took about one pill and I

            3    couldn't do it.

            4    Q.      Did she ever refer you to a psychologist or

            5    psychiatrist?

            6    A.      No.

            7    Q.      Or than Doctor Monstone did you ever go to see

            8    a psychiatrist or a psychologist for your anxiety?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Did you seek any other treatment other than

           11    Doctor Monstone for your anxiety?

           12    A.      No.

           13    Q.      How many times did you see Doctor Monstone?

           14    A.      After the accident probably about two.

           15    Q.      You think that was sometime in April and

           16    Mayish?

           17    A.      I think so, yes, sir.

           18    Q.      Did Doctor Monstone do any treatment for you

           19    or just exams?

           20    A.      Just exams.

           21    Q.      Did Doctor Monstone refer you anywhere?

           22    A.      No.

           23    Q.      Did Doctor Marini refer you anywhere?

           24    A.      No, just the two of those.

            1    Q.      Other than Doctor Monstone and Doctor Marini

            2    did you seek any other treatment as a result of this

            3    accident?

            4    A.      No.

            5    Q.      As you sit here today are you still treating

            6    for this accident?

            7    A.      No.

            8    Q.      Are you still treating with Doctor Marini as

            9    you sit here today?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      When do you believe you stopped treating for

           12    this accident with Doctor Marini?

           13    A.      Probably the Fall of that year, the Fall of

           14    2017.

           15    Q.      Do you believe that it trailed off after May

           16    25th of that year of 2017?

           17    A.      Yes, it got better.

           18    Q.      I mean your treatment dates?

           19    A.      Yes, yes.

           20    Q.      After May 25th you believe you slowed down?

           21    A.      Yes, definitely.

           22    Q.      So not quite three to four times a week?

           23    A.      No.

           24    Q.      And you believe the treatment that you were

                                                                      74




            1    receiving after the Fall of 2017 was not from this

            2    accident, just kind of your baseline?

            3    A.      Partially it was like I said because

            4    immediately after I was seeing him more than I was

            5    prior to the accident.  But eventually, yes, I went

            6    back to my regular treatment.

            7    Q.      And that's what I want to find out.

            8                   When was that?

            9    A.      About the Fall.

           10    Q.      So about Fall of 2017 you went --

           11    A.      Then I started seeing him about once a month

           12    or once every couple of months as usual, yes.

           13    Q.      So in the Fall of 2017 you started treating

           14    the same duration and the number of times per month as

           15    you were before the accident?

           16    A.      Correct.

           17    Q.      And then Fall of 2017 with Doctor Marini you

           18    kind of went back to your pre-accident appointment

           19    times and dates?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      As you sit here today do you have any plans on

           22    getting any injections or surgery as a result of this

           23    accident?

           24    A.      No.

                                                                      75




            1    Q.      Have you ever had -- well, let me rephrase and

            2    ask another question.

            3                   As you sit here today are you on any

            4    medical restrictions?

            5    A.      No.

            6    Q.      As you sit here today are your activities

            7    restricted in anyway as a result of the accident?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      Have you ever had a prior MRI or imaging study

           10    before this accident in April of 2017?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Do you know when that was?

           13    A.      No.

           14    Q.      I see that you might have had an MRI in

           15    September of 2016; do you remember that?

           16    A.      September, 2016?

           17    Q.      Yes.

           18    A.      I don't remember.

           19    Q.      And perhaps a CT August of 2016?

           20    A.      So that must have been with my primary doctor

           21    with Stephanie, yes.

           22    Q.      Do you know what that would have been for or

           23    why?

           24    A.      I did a sleep study.  That had to be during

                                                                      76




            1    that time.

            2    Q.      Would that have been of your neck?

            3    A.      Sleep study?

            4    Q.      Yes.

            5    A.      No, a sleep study is when they monitor your

            6    sleeping pattern.  So they do an MRI of like your head

            7    area like to see your brain waves, that kind of thing.

            8    Q.      Okay, all right.

            9                   I know Doctor Marini is a chiropractor

           10    have you ever treated with a physical therapist before?

           11    A.      Prior to the accident, no.

           12    Q.      How about after the accident?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      Who did you treat with after the accident?

           15    A.      Excel Therapy.

           16    Q.      When did you start at Excel?

           17    A.      February of 2019.

           18    Q.      Where is Excel located?

           19    A.      Villanova.

           20    Q.      Why did you start at Excel?

           21    A.      It was due to the airline accident.  They

           22    treated me for my right ankle and foot.

           23    Q.      Which you did not injure here?

           24    A.      Yes, sir.

            4    Q.      Have you paid anything out-of-pocket as a

            7    Q.      Property damage?

            8    A.      Yes, sir.

           10    of $595.80.  And I believe I just got a bill from the

           11    emergency room, Delco Memorial, which I'm assuming is

           12    the studies.

           13                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Okay.

           14                   MR. MANARA:  For 1700 bucks.  I don't

           15    think that's Act 6 though.

           16                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Okay.

           17                   MR. MANARA:  Do you have anything --

           18                   MR. SAVINELL:  All I have is what we've

           19    already provided to you.  So if that came from us then

           20    that's what we have.

           21                   MR. MANARA:  Are you aware if PIP is

           22    exhausted?  I think it's a different State policy.

           23                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Yeah, I'm not sure.

           24                   MR. MANARA:  But I have everything you

            1    do?

            2                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Yes, yes.

            3                   MR. MANARA:  I'm asking, you tell me.

            4                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Everything I sent

            5    yesterday?

            6                   MR. MANARA:  Yes.

            7                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Yes.

            8                   MR. MANARA:  Got you.

            9                   Is there a property damage claim?

           10                   MR. SAVINELLI:  Not to my knowledge.

           11                   MR. MANARA:  And not married so no loss

           12    of consortium.

           13    BY MR. MANARA:

           14    Q.      Ma'am, we are almost done.  I just want to

           15    real quick do a pain scale with you, okay.

           16                   10 would be the worse pain you've ever

           17    experienced in your entire life and 0 would be nothing

           18    at all.  So as a result of this accident you indicated

           19    to me that you injured your neck, your left shoulder

           20    area and your left knee.  There are no other parts that

           21    you injured other than your neck, your left shoulder

           22    and your knee; is that correct?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      When you first started to feel pain in your

                                                                      79




            1    neck how would you rate the pain in your neck?

            2    A.      Maybe like an 8.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   At the end of treatment when I say the

            5    end of treatment when you tailed off in May of 2017,

            6    how would you rate the pain in your neck?

            7    A.      3.

            8    Q.      As you sit here today how would you rate the

            9    pain in your neck?

           10    A.      2.

           11    Q.      Discussing your left shoulder when you first

           12    started to feel pain in your left shoulder how would

           13    you rate that pain?

           14    A.      My shoulder was the worst, probably like 9.

           15    Q.      At the end of treatment kind of when you

           16    tailed off in May of 2017 how would you rate the pain

           17    in your left shoulder?

           18    A.      Same, about 3.

           19    Q.      As you sit here today how would you rate the

           20    pain in your left shoulder?

           21    A.      0.

           22    Q.      Resolved?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      80




            1                   Discussing your left knee how would you

            2    rate the pain in your left knee?

            3    A.      It was like a 6.

            4    Q.      When you first started therapy, sorry.

            5    A.      Oh, I'm sorry, maybe like an 8.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   At the end of treatment when it kind of

            8    trailed off in May of 2017 how would you rate that pain

            9    in your left knee?

           10    A.      I would say about a 3.

           11    Q.      And as you sit here today how would you rate

           12    the pain in your left knee?

           13    A.      So my knee is really funny because I do have

           14    intermittent issues with my knee.  So I actually

           15    recently -- I still see him off and on because of my

           16    knee giving me problems.  So it can flare up sometimes

           17    from maybe a 5 and then on a regular day maybe like a

           18    2.

           19    Q.      So in the weeks and months in the past few

           20    weeks and months you would say it's a 2 to a 5?

           21    A.      Yes, sir.

           22    Q.      And you say you still see him did you mean

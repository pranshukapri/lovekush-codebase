 8                        EXAMINATION

 9  BY MS. HASKELL:

10       Q.    Could you please state and spell your first 

11  and last name for the record?

12       A.    My name is Della Young, D-E-L-L-A, Y-O-U-N-G.

13       MS. HASKELL:  Let the record reflect that this is 

14  the discovery deposition of Della Young taken pursuant 

15  to notice by agreement of the parties and witness and 

16  pursuant to all Illinois Rules of Civil Procedure, 

17  Illinois Supreme Court Rules, and local rules.  

18  BY MS. HASKELL:

19       Q.    Good morning, Ms. Young.  

20       A.    Good morning.

21       Q.    Have you ever given a deposition before?

22       A.    Yes.

23       Q.    How long ago?

24       A.    About three years ago.  Three, four years ago.


                                                                 5

 1       Q.    Only one deposition?

 2       A.    Yes.

 3       Q.    Was that in a case where you were a party or 

 4  were you a witness?

 5       A.    I was a witness.

 6       Q.    What type of case was that?

 7       A.    It was a medical malpractice.

 8       Q.    Was it in Cook County?

 9       A.    Yes.

10       Q.    Did you have to testify at trial?

11       A.    Yes.

12       Q.    You may remember from that experience, and I 

13  am sure your attorney went over with you about what to 

14  expect today.  I am just going to run through some of 

15  the standard ground rules today so that we are all on 

16  the same page.  

17             As you can see we have a court reporter here 

18  taking down everything that we say.  For that reason all 

19  your answers need to be out loud.  Feel free to shake 

20  your head, nod your head, shrug your shoulders, as long 

21  as you also give an out loud response.  

22       A.    Okay.

23       Q.    Similarly, uh-huh and uh-uh look exactly the 

24  same in writing.  So if the court reporter, me, or your 


                                                                 6

 1  attorney says is that a yes or a no, it is not because 

 2  we don't know what you mean.  We are just making sure 

 3  the record is clear.  

 4       A.    Right.

 5       Q.    If at any point you need to take a break, need 

 6  something to drink, use the restroom, speak to your 

 7  attorney, perfectly fine.  Just let me know, so long as 

 8  there is no question pending.  If any of my questions 

 9  don't make sense to you or you would like me to rephrase 

10  them in some way, please let me know and I am happy to 

11  do that.  If you answer the question, I am going to 

12  assume that you understood it.  

13       A.    Okay.

14       Q.    Sometimes people think they know what they are 

15  answering and then we get a few questions down the road 

16  and realize we are talking about two separate things.  

17  So if you have any questions about what I am asking 

18  about, feel free to let me know.  

19       A.    Okay.

20       Q.    Your attorney may object to some of my 

21  questions.  I may object to some of his.  We don't have 

22  a judge here to rule on those objections.  So unless 

23  your attorney instructs you not to answer, and you 

24  choose to take that instruction, you need to answer that 


                                                                 7

 1  question.  

 2             And then one last thing, in casual 

 3  conversation I know we talk over each other a lot.  You 

 4  probably will know where I am going with some of these 

 5  questions, but for the sake of the court reporter wait 

 6  until I am done with my question until you answer; and 

 7  likewise, I will wait until you finish your answer 

 8  before I ask the next question.  

 9       A.    Okay.

10       Q.    What is your date of birth?

11       A.    July 30, 1965.

12       Q.    Happy recent birthday to you.  

13       A.    Thank you.

14       Q.    And what are the last four digits of your 

15  social?

16       A.    5763.

17       Q.    What is your current address?

18       A.    6402 South Long Avenue.

19       Q.    Long?  

20       A.    Long, L-O-N-G, and that's in Chicago 60638.

21       Q.    And who do you live there with?

22       A.    My husband and my son and my recent 

23  daughter-in-law.

24       Q.    What is your husband's name?


                                                                 8

 1       A.    Ronald Marciniak.  

 2       Q.    And spell that last name?

 3       A.    M-A-R-C-I-N-I-A-K.  We have been together for 

 4  36 years.  We just decided to get married in April.

 5       Q.    Oh wow, congratulations.

 6       A.    Thank you.  Even the judge was you are holding 

 7  the record for me.  And everybody is why did you wait so 

 8  long?  Well, I didn't know if I wanted to kick him to 

 9  the curb or not.

10       Q.    36 years convinced you it's worth sticking 

11  around.  

12       A.    He was playing hard to get.  

13       Q.    And what is your son's name?

14       A.    Ronald Marciniak.

15       Q.    And how old is your son?

16       A.    Ronald is 29.

17       Q.    And you said your daughter-in-law is with you 

18  as well?

19       A.    Yes.

20       Q.    And what is her name?

21       A.    Lauren McGurn, M-C-G-U-R-N.  

22       Q.    How long have you all lived at the address on 

23  Long Avenue?

24       A.    15 years.


                                                                 9

 1       Q.    And any plans to move in the near future?

 2       A.    I hope so.

 3       Q.    You are looking to move?

 4       A.    Yes.  Actually, we are going to Florida next 

 5  month.  We usually go every year because we do a big 

 6  family trip, but my husband wasn't doing too well, and 

 7  so we decided to wait.  We are going in September and we 

 8  are driving. 

 9       Q.    Do you have a place down there?

10       A.    No.  We are actually going to stay at Treasure 

11  Island, and we are going to bring our dog with us, 

12  hundred pound German Shepherd.  He is a police dog.  

13       Q.    Okay.  Long drive, though, right?

14       A.    Oh, yeah.

15       Q.    Let's see.  Do you have any other children 

16  other than Ronald?

16       A.    87th and Harlem.  7257 West 87th Street.

17       Q.    And based on the records we received from your 

18  lawyer, it said that you stopped working there in around 

19  September of 2016; is that correct?

20       A.    Correct.

21       Q.    What was the circumstances that led to you 

22  stop working?

23       A.    When I originally had my accident, I went 

24  back, and I went from 40 hours to 30 hours because our 


                                                                 13

 1  office dealt with mentally and physically handicapped 

 2  patients, and I couldn't handle my workload because of 

 3  my accident.  So I was cut down to 30 hours and then cut 

 4  down again to 12 hours, and then terminated.

 5       Q.    To 12 hours?

 6       A.    Yeah, it went down to 12 hours a week and then 

 7  I was terminated.

 8       Q.    And that was in a span of about a month?

 9       A.    No.  That's -- 

10       Q.    Because your accident was in August.  

11       A.    August, correct.  It was August 7th.

12       Q.    And at some point in September you were let 

13  go?

14       A.    No.  It was the week before Christmas.  It was 

15  the one week exactly before Christmas.  

16       Q.    Did you request that your hours be reduced or 

17  did the office?

18       A.    The doctor because I couldn't move patients.  

19  I couldn't do anything.

20       Q.    What were your general job duties as the 

21  office manager at that location?

22       A.    I arranged transportation for patients.  I 

23  made appointments.  I assisted the doctor.  I cleaned 

24  the office.  I sterilized all the instruments.  I took 


                                                                 14

 1  X-rays.  I did impressions for dentures.  I have done 

 2  almost everything except pull a tooth.  

 3       Q.    How many other staff members were working 

 4  there?

 5       A.    There was -- when I first started there was 

 6  six of us, and then we went down to four, and then we 

 7  went down to the four of us, it was me, the doctor, the 

 8  doctor's -- and the doctor's sister.  So we went down to 

 9  three.

10       Q.    At the time of your accident at Wal-Mart was 

11  it down to three?

12       A.    It was four, yeah.  Me and the other three.  

13       Q.    When your hours were reduced, do you know who 

14  was taking on those responsibilities?

15       A.    Angie was terminated, and then it was the

20       A.    Yes.  Once when I was 13.  I broke my arm.

 2       Q.    Do you remember what hospital system he was 

 3  in?

 4       A.    MacNeal.  I think it was MacNeal because I 

 5  walked around for three months with a broken arm 

 6  thinking it will get better, but when I had to start 

 7  moving it manually, I knew something was wrong.

 8       Q.    And that's your right arm?

 9       A.    Yes.  It was my forearm.

10       Q.    Did you have to have any surgery for that?

11       A.    No.  Actually, it broke in the exact same 

12  place that I broke it the first time, and it started to 

13  heal the same way.  So they just put it in a cast.

14       Q.    How long were you in a cast?

15       A.    Probably about six weeks.

16       Q.    Did you have to go to physical therapy at all?

18       Q.    Okay.  So I want to turn to the day of your 

19  fall at Wal-Mart, and as you stated before, that was 

20  August 7, 2016, right?

21       A.    Correct.

22       Q.    So if I refer to the fall or the accident, 

23  that's the date I am talking about, okay?

24       A.    Okay.

11       Q.    When you arrived at the store, were you in

22  I wear them for work.

23       Q.    Sketchers sneakers?

24       A.    Yes.


                                                                 21

14  driving or anything?

15       A.    No.

16       Q.    So you get to the store with your husband 

17  sometime between 12 and 2.  Can you describe for me once 

18  you arrived at the store what you did?

19       A.    We just walked through and did our shopping, 

20  picked up our things here and there.  And then we 

21  checked out, and I got outside and I went, I forgot the 

22  dog food and that's what I came for.  

23             So I was, like, oh, my God.  So I walked 

24  through, and I walked through the self-checkout, and the 


                                                                 22

 1  next thing I knew I was on the floor.  And I had two 

 2  people pick me up.  

 3             And I was, like, you know, what happened?  And 

 4  then I was sticky like a jam kind of slimy, wet, sticky 

 5  all over me.  And the two people that had picked me 

 6  up -- 

 7       MR. MALATESTA:  Della, just listen to her question 

 8  and answer her question.  She is going to ask you -- 

 9       MS. HASKELL:  We are going to break it down.

10       MR. MALATESTA:  She will break all that stuff down.  

11  Just listen to her question and answer the question.

12  BY THE WITNESS:

13       A.    I just fell.  I slipped and down I went.

14       Q.    So you and your husband go to the store and 

15  you did all of your shopping.  You said you checked out.  

16             Did you check out at the self registers or did 

17  you check out at the regular registers?

18       A.    I checked out at the regular registers.  

19       Q.    Okay.  And you left the store and went to your 

20  car?  

21       A.    No.  We walked outside and I looked at the 

22  cart and realized that I had forgot the dog food which 

23  was the main reason I went there.

24       Q.    Did your husband go back inside with you or 


                                                                 23

 6  located?

 7       A.    All the way in the back.

 8       Q.    And on that day do you remember what entrance

21  was, like, I posed or something.

22       Q.    Oh, no, that's okay.  So you -- did you get 

23  all the way outside the store before you realized that 

24  you forgot the dog food or were you in that vestibule 


                                                                 24

 1  area?

 2       A.    I walked out the doors and we were right in 

 3  front of the store and I looked at my husband and said I 

 4  forgot the dog food.  And I said, okay.  I am going to 

 5  go back in.  He said he was going to load the car.  I 

 6  walked in and I walked through and I went down.

 7       Q.    So when you reentered the store you walked by 

 8  the self-checkout area, correct. 

 9       A.    Yes.  I walked through it.  I shouldn't have,

12       A.    From my understanding some fruity substance on 

13  the floor.

14       Q.    Now, when you say from my understanding, did 

15  you see the fruit on the floor?

10       A.    After I went down, they were picking me up 

11  from the back, and they were, like, oh, my God, she fell 

12  on those grapes.  And then I was, like, I looked and it 

13  was just all over me.

14       Q.    All over you where?

15       A.    All over my leg; all over my hands.

16       Q.    What color grapes were they?

17       A.    I think they were the grape ones, the purple 

18  colored ones because the guts were purple.

19       Q.    Okay.  And can you describe for me what they 

20  looked like on the ground when you first saw them?

21       A.    They were trampled.  They obviously had been 

22  there because they were trampled when I fell.  Because 

23  it wasn't, like, they were whole.  It was, like, they 

24  were on the ground, and went like that.


                                                                 26

 1       Q.    Do you know if it was your foot that caused 

 2  them to be smashed or if they were smashed before?  

 3       A.    They were smashed before.

 4       Q.    And how do you know that?

 5       A.    Because they weren't freshly smashed.  They 

 6  were kind of sticky, like, they had been there and they 

 7  had been stepped in a couple of times.

 8       Q.    Did anyone tell you what those grapes looked 

 9  like before you fell?

 6  and picked me up off the floor.  

 7             He walked me over to the Subway which had two 

 8  security guards; told me that I had fallen.  They had 

 9  then notified the store manager.  

10             She came over; said what happened?  I told her 

11  I fell.  She asked what hurt.  I said my knee because 

12  the immediate pain I felt, it felt like under my kneecap 

13  was bleeding.  That's how painful it was.

15       A.    My left knee.

19  anything, but then that was it.  She walked away and we 

20  were done.

21       Q.    Do you know what her name was, that manager 

22  that you spoke to?

23       A.    You know what, it was an unusual name.

 4       A.    No.

 5       Q.    You described for me feeling some knee pain.  

 6  Can you describe how your body landed when you fell, if 

 7  you remember?

 8       A.    It was kind of funny.  It was kind of like one 

 9  of those, oops, I meant to do that.  When it happened, I 

10  came down on my left knee, bounced back on my right arm, 

11  and then landed on my ass.

12       Q.    Did you hit your head at all?

13       A.    No.  It was just mostly the knee and the 

14  shoulder that took the brunt of it.

15       Q.    When you fell, were you holding anything in 

16  your hand?

17       A.    Just my purse.

18       Q.    Was anything blocking your view of the floor 

19  when you were walking through that self-checkout area?

20       A.    It was pretty crowded.  There was some people 

21  in line.

22       Q.    Were you able to see where you were going 

23  though?

24       A.    Yes.


                                                                 30

 1       Q.    And were you distracted by anything?

 2       A.    No.  I was focused on getting the dog food.

 3       Q.    Okay.  I just want to go through a couple 

 4  documents.  This is what we have marked as Exhibit 1.  

 5             Do you recognize this document?

 6       A.    Yes.

 7       Q.    And for the record, this is a document labeled 

 8  customer statement, correct?

 9       A.    Um-hum.

10       MR. MALATESTA:  Is that a yes?  

11       THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I'm sorry.

12       MR. MALATESTA:  That's okay.  Everyone does it.

13  BY MS. HASKELL:

14       Q.    Is this written in your handwriting?

15       A.    No.  Actually, my husband wrote this.

16       Q.    And I don't know if I said that, but we have 

17  marked this as Exhibit 1.

18       A.    Right.

19       Q.    Were you with your husband when he filled this 

20  out?

21       A.    Yes.

22       Q.    And did he fill this out in that subway area 

23  where you were sitting?

24       A.    Yes.


                                                                 31

 1       Q.    So if you see towards the top half of the 

 2  page, the portion that says "describe in your own words 

 3  the event leading up to the incident."  

 4       A.    Right.

 5       Q.    Can you just read into t he record what he has 

 6  written there?

 7       A.    Walking by self-checkout.  There were grapes 

 8  on the floor I did not see and then fell.  

 9       Q.    And that is what you recall as how your fall 

10  happened as well?

11       A.    Yes.

12       Q.    Down here next to name of associate you 

13  reported the incident to is written Lupe?

14       A.    Lupe.  

15       Q.    Is that the woman you believe you spoke to?

16       A.    Yes.

17       Q.    And next to customer signature, is that your 

18  signature?

19       A.    Yes, it is.

20       Q.    I am going to skip to Exhibit 3 next.  

21  Ms. Young, I have marked as Exhibit 3 a still shot from 

22  the video footage and it is time stamped 4:42:30.  

23             Do you see yourself in this picture?

24       A.    Yes.


                                                                 32

 1       Q.    And can you describe where you are in the 

 2  picture, for the record?

 3       A.    I am walking through the self-checkout.

 4       Q.    Is this you with the shirt and the pink bag? 

 5       A.    The pink purse, yeah.

 6       Q.    And for purposes of the record, your fall 

 7  happened where in this photograph?

 8       A.    Right over here (pointing).

 9       Q.    And you are pointing to what, the entrance to 

10  the self-checkout?

11       A.    Yes.  This is the entrance because this is 

12  where I came in.  I came in this way, and then as I was 

13  walking, that's where I fell.  Because these people 

14  right here, they are the ones that picked me up and told 

15  me about the grapes.

16       Q.    Okay.  So I am just going to walk you through 

17  that so when we are reading this back later we know what 

18  we are talking about.  

19             So you walked through this area towards this 

20  entrance to the self-checkout where we see some 

21  merchandise on either side?

22       A.    Yes.

23       Q.    And you pointed to these people at that first 

24  self-checkout register on the right-hand side?


                                                                 33

 1       A.    Yes.

 2       Q.    And they are the customers that helped you up?

 3       A.    Yes.

 4       Q.    A couple months after your fall, did you 

 5  receive a phone call from somebody at Wal-Mart to talk 

 6  about what had happened?

 7       A.    Yes.

 8       Q.    And do you remember giving an interview to 

 9  them?

10       A.    I didn't speak with them.  I was told not to 

11  speak with them.

12       Q.    Okay.  I want to show you what we have as a 

13  transcription of an interview from December 7, 2016, 

14  that we have marked as Exhibit 2.  And feel free to take 

15  a minute and look through that.

16                           (Witness looking through 

17                           document.)

18       Q.    Does looking at this refresh your memory?  

19       A.    Yes.  This is when I had talked to Mark.

20       Q.    So I want you to just kind of look through 

21  this, feel free to flip through it, and let me know if 

22  everything in here looks correct and accurate to the 

23  best of your memory.

24       A.    Okay.


                                                                 34

 1                           (Witness looking through 

 2                           document.)

 3       Q.    Okay.  You had an opportunity to flip through 

 4  this?

 5       A.    Yes.

 6       Q.    Did everything in there look accurate to the 

 7  best of your memory?

 8       A.    Yes.

 9       Q.    And based on the interview that you gave to 

10  Wal-Mart and that we just looked through, it looked like 

11  you described the grapes as being about one foot by one 

12  foot in size?

13       A.    Yeah, like one pile.  They were inside the --

14       Q.    After you fell, did you show any Wal-Mart 

15  employees the area where you fell?

16       A.    Yes.

17       Q.    And was that Lupe or someone else?

18       A.    That was Lupe.

19       Q.    And was that before or after you completed the 

20  statement?

21       A.    Before.

22       Q.    Were you --

23       A.    Because as I was talking to her and she was 

24  giving me the ice, I even looked over and I said they 


                                                                 35

 1  didn't even clean that up yet.

 2       Q.    Could you see the area where you fell from the 

 3  Subway?

 4       A.    Yes.

 5       Q.    And you did not see any employees clean it up?

 6       A.    No.

 7       Q.    When you watched the video with your attorney, 

 8  did you watch after your fall as well?

 9       A.    They only showed up until when I fell.  That 

10  was it.

11       MR. MALATESTA:  That's the only clip I have, I 

12  think.  My clip has right after her fall.

13       MS. HASKELL:  Off the record.

14                           (Discussion off the record.)

15       MS. HASKELL:  We can go back on the record.

16  BY MS. HASKELL:

17       Q.    So just to confirm, your memory of the 

18  incident is that while you were in the Subway area you 

19  could see the self-checkout area where you fell and you 

20  did you not see any employees cleaning up the area?

21       A.    No, because the way I was positioned, the 

22  self-checkout is here, and they had me sitting this way, 

23  and they had my knee up with the ice pack and I was 

24  looking at the self-checkout.  I was waiting to see if 


                                                                 36

 1  anyone was going to clean it.

 2       Q.    So for the purposes of the record, the 

 3  self-checkout area was on your left-hand side and you 

 4  could look over and see it?

 5       A.    Correct.

 6       Q.    And you were looking over to see whether it 

 7  was going to be cleaned up?

 8       A.    I was just looking because that's the way they 

 9  had me positioned.

10       Q.    When is the first time that you sought medical 

11  care for your injuries after your fall.

12       A.    On the 9th.

13       Q.    And where did you go?

14       A.    I went to the -- it is Harlem Medical.  It is 

15  two doors away from where I worked.  Because that 

16  happened on a Sunday.  Monday morning I did not go to 

17  work because I couldn't walk.  

18             And then Tuesday I limped into work.  I tried 

19  to work.  I went to see the doctor.  The doctor sent me 

20  for an MRI, and then that's when everything started 

21  happening.  

22       Q.    So on Tuesday you tried to go into work.  You 

23  were experiencing pain so you went to Harlem Medical at 

24  that point?


                                                                 37

 1       A.    On Wednesday which was the 9th.

 2       Q.    Oh, okay.  What doctor sent you for an MRI?

 4       Q.    Had you seen Dr. Rashan before?

 5       A.    Yes.

 6       Q.    And do you know what kind of doctor Dr. Rashan 

 7  is?

 8       A.    He is just a general M.D.

 9       Q.    And did you tell him about your fall at 

10  Wal-Mart?

11       A.    Yes.

12       Q.    What parts of your body were you experiencing 

13  pain in when you went to see Dr. Rashan?

14       A.    My knee and my shoulder.

15       Q.    And that is your right knee?

16       A.    My left knee and my right shoulder, yes.

17       Q.    And right shoulder.  Other than your left knee 

18  and right shoulder, did you injure any other parts of 

19  your body during your fall?  

20       A.    My butt was sore.

21       Q.    Anything else?

22       A.    No.

23       Q.    Where did you go for the MRI?

24       A.    I went to pre -- this is crazy that I remember 


                                                                 38

 1  this.  I went to Premier Medical, and it is on 95th and 

 2  Central.

 3       Q.    Did you go that same day?

 4       A.    I'm really not sure.

 5       Q.    Okay.

 6       A.    If I didn't go that day, I think I went the 

 7  next day.

 8       Q.    At some point you went to see an orthopedic 

 9  surgeon named Dr. Silver; is that right?

10       A.    Um-hum.

11       Q.    Had you seen Dr. Rashan more than once before 

12  going to see Dr. Silver?

13       A.    No.  I see Dr. Rashan, and then I went to see 

14  Dr. Silver.

15       Q.    Did Dr. Rashan refer you to Dr. Silver?

16       A.    I think so.

17       Q.    And we received some of your medical records 

18  from your attorney, and those medical records show that 

19  you went to Dr. Silver on August 31st.  Does that sound 

20  right?

21       A.    Yes.

22       Q.    Had you ever seen Dr. Silver before?

23       A.    No.

24       Q.    Did you tell him about your fall at Wal-Mart?


                                                                 39

 1       A.    Yes.

 2       Q.    What did he recommend?  And, again, I know you 

 3  are not a physician so I don't expect you to know all 

 4  the terms.  

 5       A.    He recommended to have a scope done on my knee 

 6  and rotator cuff repair.

 7       Q.    Did he prescribe you any pain medication?

 8       A.    Yes, he did.

 9       Q.    Do you remember what that was?

10       A.    He gave me Tramadol and then the Tramadol, I 

11  had a bad reaction to it.  So he gave me the 

12  Hydrocodone, five milligrams, and that was it.

13       Q.    How often did you have to take the 

14  Hydrocodone?

15       A.    Before the surgery three to four times a day.

16       Q.    He gave you an injection for your shoulder, 

17  correct?

18       A.    Yes.  That was cortisone.

19       Q.    Did you have just one injection?

20       A.    He did the injection, and it lasted probably 

21  about two months, and then I seen another orthopedic 

22  surgeon, Brian Amerson, and he just repeated everything 

23  that Dr. Silver did, but when he gave me the second 

24  injection in my shoulder, if felt like my arm was going 


                                                                 40

 1  to blow up.

 2       Q.    You were in more pain after the injection?  

 3       A.    Yes, yes.

 4       Q.    Was Dr. Brian Amerson at the same practice as 

 5  Dr. Silver?

 6       A.    No.  Dr. Silver stopped taking my -- he didn't 

 7  take my insurance so I had to find an orthopedic surgeon 

 8  that did and that was Dr. Amerson?

 9       Q.    Okay.  The records show that you kept seeing 

10  Dr. Silver through about June of 2017.  Does that sound 

11  about right?

12       A.    Yes.

13       Q.    Was it at that point that you switched 

14  doctors?

15       A.    Yeah.  He was a wonderful doctor.

16       Q.    Dr. Silver?

17       A.    Yes.

18       Q.    And Dr. Silver recommended you undergo 

19  physical therapy too, right?

20       A.    Yes.

21       Q.    When you were treating with Dr. Silver, where 

22  did you go to physical therapy?

23       A.    Athletic.

24       Q.    Athletico?


                                                                 41

 1       A.    Yeah.

 2       Q.    And what location?

 3       A.    First it was one on Pulaski.  I think it is at 

 4  42nd and Pulaski.  And then I went to Archer and around 

 5  Narragansett.

 6       Q.    Okay.

 7       A.    And then from there I started doing it at 

 8  Mercy Hospital.

 9       Q.    Okay.  Was that when you switched doctors or 

10  before then?

11       A.    After I had my surgery -- 

12       Q.    Okay.

13       A.    -- I started doing physical therapy at Mercy.

14       Q.    Okay.  Had you talk to Dr. Silver about which 

15  surgery he was recommending first, your knee or your 

16  shoulder?

17       A.    I wanted to scope my knee first, and then he 

18  was going to do the shoulder.

19       Q.    The records also show that he prescribed Norco 

20  for your pain.  Do you remember taking that?

21       A.    Yes.  Isn't that Hydrocodone?  

22       Q.    And it looks like you took that throughout 

23  most of 2017?

24       A.    Yes.


                                                                 42

 1       Q.    Earlier you talked about having to take that 

 2  three to four times a day before surgery.  Was that 

 3  consistent throughout the time he prescribed it?

 4       A.    Yes.  I mean, some days it was two to three 

 5  times.  Some days it was just one.  It depended.  

 6       Q.    Okay.  And in February of 2018, you had 

 7  shoulder surgery?

 8       A.    February 1st, correct.

 9       Q.    And the records show that was performed by a 

10  Dr. John Miller.  Does that sound right?

11       A.    Yes.  He is amazing.

12       Q.    Had you met him before your surgery?  

13       A.    Actually, I went to go see my primary doctor, 

14  and she told me they just got an orthopedic surgeon at 

15  Mercy.  I have been going to Mercy for 37 years now.  So 

16  when I heard that I was excited and I went to see 

17  Dr. Miller.  And he did another MRI and he did X-rays 

18  and he scheduled me for surgery exactly a month later.  

19       Q.    So your primary doc had referred you to him?

20       A.    Yes.

21       Q.    And you had that shoulder surgery at Mercy?

22       A.    Yes, in the outpatient center.

23       Q.    And you were under anesthesia during that 

24  surgery, right?


                                                                 43

 1       A.    Correct.

 2       Q.    So you couldn't feel any pain and --

 3                           (Whereupon, there was a knock 

 4                           on the door.)

 5       MS. HASKELL:  Off the record.

 6                           (Brief interruption.)

 7       MS. HASKELL:  We can go back on the record.

 8  BY MS. HASKELL:

 9       Q.    Okay.  After your right shoulder surgery with 

10  Dr. Miller, you continued to follow up with him; is that 

11  right?

12       A.    Yes, until he advised me that he was no longer 

13  accepting my insurance and that he was leaving Mercy 

14  Hospital.

15       Q.    When did that happen?

16       A.    Right after I started seeing him.  Right after 

17  my surgery.  Like, I seen him, like, three times after 

18  my surgery, and he just recommended that I go to 

19  physical therapy, which I did.  I did it at Mercy.  I 

20  did it at one of Mercy's little clinics.  Then I went to 

21  UIC.  I seen another orthopedic surgeon that also 

22  recommended me for therapy, and now I am registered to 

23  do therapy at Mercy Medical on 55th and Pulaski.

24       Q.    All right.  Let's back up a little bit and go 


                                                                 44

 1  through that.  

 2             So you had a few visits with Dr. Miller after 

 3  your shoulder surgery, right?

 4       A.    Yes.

 5       Q.    And it looks like he recommended you wear a 

 6  sling on your arm?

 7       A.    I was in it for six months.  

 8       Q.    Were you told to wear that all the time?

 9       A.    24/7.  The only time I could take it off was 

10  to shower.

11       Q.    And did you wear it all the time?

12       A.    Oh, yeah.

13       Q.    He has a note following your surgery from a 

14  February visit that said that you had reported to him 

15  that you were not wearing the sling and were trying to 

16  move your arm on your own.  

17             Does that sound right, or no?

18       A.    No.  Actually, when I did go see him, and 

19  after that visit, and he asked me to take my sling off 

20  and I did.  And he showed me -- he asked me to move my 

21  arm, and I did.  That's the only time I took the sling 

22  off.  

23       Q.    At his office?

24       A.    Yes.


                                                                 45

 1       Q.    So you would disagree with his notes that say 

 2  you weren't being compliant with the activity 

 3  restrictions?

 4       A.    No.  I mean, it is hard not to.  It is a very, 

 5  very painful surgery.  It is very painful.

 6       Q.    And how long after your surgery did you start 

 7  physical therapy; do you remember?

 8       A.    Um -- 

 9       Q.    And, again, I don't mean to make this soul 

10  like a memory quiz.  

11       A.    Probably six months, after I came out of the 

12  sling.

13       Q.    You mentioned earlier that you saw an 

14  orthopedic surgeon at UIC?

15       A.    Yes.

16       Q.    Do you know the name of that doctor?

17       A.    I seen him one time.  He told me to do 

18  physical therapy and then see him in six weeks.

19       Q.    And you have only seen him once?

20       A.    I have only seen him once.  I went to do my 

21  registration for my physical therapy and they couldn't 

22  get the dates straight, and they were going to call me 

23  back.  So then I just went to my primary and she told me 

24  just do the physical therapy at Mercy.  


                                                                 46

 1       Q.    Okay.  So in terms of orthopedic doctors, you 

 2  have seen Dr. Silver, right?

 3       A.    Um-hum.

 4       Q.    Dr. Brian -- 

 5       A.    Amerson.

 6       Q.    -- Amerson, Dr. Miller, and this doctor at 

 7  UIC?

 8       A.    Yeah.  I only seen him one time at UIC.  I 

 9  don't plan on going back to him.

10       Q.    Do you have another orthopedic doctor that you 

11  plan to follow up with?

12       A.    Dr. Miller.

13       Q.    And he is no longer taking your insurance 

14  though?

15       A.    Well, now I have different insurance so he 

16  does accept it, and he is in Orland Park now.  I tracked 

17  him down. 

18       Q.    Okay.  Do you have an upcoming appointment 

19  scheduled with him?

20       A.    No.

21       Q.    Have you visited with Dr. Miller yet?

22       A.    No.

23       Q.    And I mean yet, since that time in 2018?

24       A.    No.


                                                                 47

 1       Q.    Are you currently in physical therapy?

 2       A.    Yes.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  No, I am not.

 3       Q.    When is the last time you were in physical 

 4  therapy?

 5       A.    The last time I went for my evaluation, they 

 6  have a reevaluation, it was probably a month ago.

 7       Q.    Okay.  Was that at Mercy?

 8       A.    No.  That was at UIC.  They were trying to do 

 9  different -- because I have other issues besides this 

10  for physical therapy.  They were trying to get all the 

11  dates together.  They just had a lack of communication.  

12  So that's when I went to my primary and she said just to 

13  finish it at Mercy.

14       Q.    So you are getting physical therapy for other 

15  issues other than your shoulder and your knee?

16       A.    Yes.

17       Q.    What other issues?

18       A.    Well, since this one was torn, I overextended 

19  this one.  So now I have this one is torn.  I have 

20  fractures in my left hand, and I have fractures in my 

21  right hand.

22       Q.    And just for the record so we know what we are 

23  talking about later when we read this, you said you 

24  initially tore the left?


                                                                 48

 1       A.    The right in the accident.

 2       Q.    Okay.  

 3       A.    And from not having the use of my right arm, I 

 4  had to use my left arm, which I overextended my left arm 

 5  and now this one is torn.

 6       MR. MALATESTA:  And when you were saying this one 

 7  is overextended -- 

 8       THE WITNESS:  My left one, correct.

 9  BY MS. HASKELL:  

10       Q.    Has any doctor told you that your left 

11  shoulder injury is related to your fall at Wal-Mart?

12       A.    No.

13       Q.    Have you had any --

14       A.    I'm sorry.  Dr. Miller did tell me that from 

15  having this one, this one was overextended, over 

16  something.

17       Q.    Okay.  So Dr. Miller told you from having your 

18  right shoulder injured, you overdone your --

19       A.    Extended my left one, correct.

20       Q.    Has Dr. Miller or any other doctor diagnosed 

21  you with any condition relating to your left shoulder?

22       A.    I do have a torn rotator cuff.

23       Q.    And that was Dr. Miller that told you that?

24       A.    That was the orthopedic surgeon from UIC.


                                                                 49

18       Q.    Has any doctor scheduled you for surgery of 

19  your left knee?

20       A.    No.

21       Q.    Has any doctor told you that your left 

22  shoulder will need surgery?

23       A.    Yes.  That was the orthopedic surgeon from 

24  UIC.  He wants to try the therapy first.


                                                                 50

 3       A.    Yes.

 4       Q.    And how so?

 5       A.    After I fell, it destroyed my life.  I lost my

22  both, but he said that he is going to recommend me to 

23  somebody but there is a waiting list right now.  They 

24  are really backed up, so...


                                                                 52

21       Q.    When is the last time you saw your primary 

22  doctor?

23       A.    I see my primary once a month.

24       Q.    Once a month?

11       Q.    And that is your shoulder?

12       A.    Yes.  Not only that, when Dr. Miller did my 

13  surgery, he was telling me that when he did it, there 

14  was going to be a twitch in my arm because he had to cut 

15  some muscle and do something.  Well, ever since he did 

16  this, I have this twitch now to where my neck twitches 

17  all the time.  It is kind of weird because I don't know 

18  if anybody can see it.

19       Q.    And have you been telling your primary doctor 

20  about that?

21       A.    Oh, yeah.

10  appointment with Dr. Miller?

11       A.    No.

12       Q.    We talked about this a little bit before, but 

13  I want to go back to it.  

14             What activities could you do before your fall 

15  at Wal-Mart that you can no longer do now?  We will 

16  start with just physical activities.  

17       A.    Okay.  I was able to lift my arms over my 

18  head.

19       Q.    Okay.

20       A.    Now, this is as far as I can go.

21       Q.    And for the record, your arms are just below 

22  parallel to -- 

23       A.    Yes.  I can't lift them any higher or else my 

24  muscles snap.  I can't fold clothes.  I can't do dishes.  


                                                                 55

 1  I can't wash my hair.  I can't make a bed.

 2       Q.    Who does the household chores around the house 

 3  now?

 4       A.    My husband and my son and my daughter-in-law 

 5  that just recently moved in.

 6       Q.    And you mentioned that you have trouble 

 7  washing your hair.  Do you go somewhere now to have your 

 8  hair washed or who helps you with that?

 9       A.    No.  I just put my head over the sink and my 

10  husband does it.  After 36 years he better do something.

11       Q.    Any other activities around the house that you 

12  no longer can do?

13       A.    You know, I can't even play with my grandkids.

19       Q.    What types of activities did you do with your 

20  grandkids before your injury?

21       A.    I used to be able to take them to the park, go 

22  on the swings, go down the slide, swing them around, 

23  pick them up.  I can't do any of that anymore.

24       Q.    Are there any hobbies or things outside the

 1  house that you can't do now that you could do before 

 2  your fall?

 3       A.    I can't go bowling.  That's for sure.

 4       Q.    How often did you used to go bowling?

 5       A.    We used to bowl, like, once every two months.

 6       Q.    Did you have a location that you always went 

 7  to the same one or where did you go?

 8       A.    No.  It just depended on where everyone wanted 

 9  to go.

10       Q.    Were you in a league or anything like that?

11       A.    No.  It was just for fun.  It was just a bunch 

12  of adults trying to get out, get away from kids, 

13  grandkids.

14       Q.    Any other activities?

15       A.    I can't swim.  I swam my whole life.  I was a 

16  lifeguard, you know, and I can't swim properly because 

17  of the pain.  

18       Q.    And what pool did you used to go swimming at?

19       A.    McKinley Park.  I go on vacation; I can't 

20  swim.  I stand in the water.  I have a pool in my 

21  backyard for my grandkids.  All I can do is float.  

22       Q.    Any other activities?

23       A.    Not that I can think of.  The kids is the 

24  biggest one.

 1       Q.    Have you sought out any temp agencies or 

 2  anything like that to help you find jobs?

 3       A.    Yes.  I am on Medicare now.  I am on 

 4  disability.

 5       Q.    The disability payments that you are receiving 

 6  now, are those related to your shoulder and knee injury?

 7       A.    Just the whole thing, the mental, just 

 8  everything.

22       A.    I go to the one in Countryside.  I go to the 

23  one on 103rd and Harlem.  I don't know what the address 

24  is.  And the one in Romeoville.  So I travel to go to

 4  Bedford Park?

 5       A.    No.

 6       Q.    Since your fall, have you had anymore 

 7  communications with those two customers that were 

 8  standing there?

 9       A.    No.

10       MS. HASKELL:  Those are all the questions that I 

11  have.  

12       MR. MALATESTA:  I just have a couple of brief ones.

13                        EXAMINATION 

14  BY MR. MALATESTA:

15       Q.    The grapes that you stepped in, when you 

16  observed them after the fall, they appeared to be 

17  trampled; is that correct?  

18       A.    Yes.

19       Q.    And you made the observation that you had come 

20  in contact with them with your foot; is that true?

21       A.    Actually, it was all over my leg and my hand.

22       Q.    Right, but my question is, you had first come 

23  in contact with them with your foot; is that true?

24       A.    Correct.


                                                                 59

 1       Q.    And then you had some on your pants leg; is 

 2  that correct?

 3       A.    Yes.

 4       Q.    And what you observed afterwards is they 

 5  appeared to be -- you used the word trampled or smashed?

 6       A.    Right.

 7       Q.    And we saw your fall on the video, correct?

 8       A.    Um-hum.

 9       Q.    Yes?

10       A.    Yes.

11       Q.    And it was your observation that they didn't 

12  appear to be just smashed from the time that you had 

13  fallen; is that true?

14       A.    True.

15       Q.    And what gave you that impression in terms of 

16  your observations?

17       A.    Because after I fell, when I got up, it wasn't 

18  freshly wet.  It was like they were stepped in, they 

19  were sticky, and it was just an icky feeling, you know, 

20  sticky and -- 

21       Q.    And that stickiness ended up on your pants 

22  true?

23       A.    Yes.

24       MR. MALATESTA:  That's all I have.  


                                                                 60

 1       MS. HASKELL:  I have nothing further.  Signature?

 2       MR. MALATESTA:  Signature is waived.

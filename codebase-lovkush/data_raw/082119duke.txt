          9                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED

         10    BY MS. ALVES:

         11        Q.   Okay.  Isaiah, thank you for coming in

         12    today.

         13        A.   No problem.

         14        Q.   Just some housekeeping rules.  So this

         15    is the court reporter.  She's transcribing

         16    everything that you say, so please keep your

         17    voice up so that she can hear you.

         18             And also, you know, as we're having

         19    this conversation, sometimes it can be human

         20    nature to nod your head or shrug your shoulders

         21    but that doesn't get picked up on the

         22    transcript.  So we just ask you to vocalize

         23    what your answer is.  So if your answer is yes,

         24    say yes.  If your answer is no, say no.  If you



                                                             5

          1    don't know, you don't know.  Okay?

          2        A.   Got you.

          3        Q.   So I have here a copy of your

          4    passport.  What is your full name?

          5        A.   Isaiah Cecil Duke.

          6        Q.   And can you spell your last name for

          7    me?

          8        A.   D-U-K-E.

          9        Q.   And your first name?

         10        A.   I-S-A-I-A-H.

         11        Q.   And what is your date of birth?

         12        A.   6/24/90.

         13        Q.   And this passport doesn't have your

         14    address.  What is your current address?

         15        A.   Current address is 146 North Beacon

         16    Street, Brighton, Massachusetts.

         17        Q.   And how long have you been living at

         18    that address?

         19        A.   About a year and a few months.

         20        Q.   Okay.  And where did you live prior to

         21    that?

         22        A.   Prior to that, I was in Randolph, 9603

         23    Avalon Drive.

         24        Q.   Okay.  And is this a current



                                                             6

          1    representation of your passport?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Okay.  I'm going to mark that as the

          4    first exhibit.

          5                  (Exhibit 1, Photocopy of

          6                  Passport, so marked.)

          7        Q.   So Isaiah, do you know why you are

          8    here today?

          9        A.   Yes, because of an incident that

         10    occurred after an event I held at Red Lantern.

         11        Q.   Do you remember the date of this

         12    event?

         13        A.   The exact date, I don't remember off

         14    the top of my head, but definitely mid May,

         15    graduation season.  So it was either May 15 or

         16    16.

         17        Q.   Of which year, do you remember?

         18        A.   Was it 2017?  That's just a wild guess

         19    because it's been a while.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember if the event

         21    was on a Friday or a Saturday night?

         22        A.   It was on a Friday.

         23        Q.   So if I told you that the incident was

         24    May 26, 2017, would that sound familiar?



                                                             7

          1        A.   May 26, 2017, was that a long weekend?

          2        Q.   I believe it would be Memorial Day

          3    weekend.

          4        A.   It actually was that weekend, yes.  It

          5    was that Friday.

          6        Q.   Okay.  Now, you said you were

          7    promoting an event there?

          8        A.   Yes, it was a graduation party.

          9        Q.   Okay.  And this was at Red Lantern?

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   Prior to this date, had you promoted

         12    any other events at Red Lantern?

         13        A.   No, this was the first one.

         14        Q.   This was your first one?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   And after that date, did you promote

         17    any other events at Red Lantern?

         18        A.   No.

         19        Q.   Why is that?

         20        A.   Mainly because of the incident.  I did

         21    promote events with the company itself, Big

         22    Night at GEM Lounge where we continued our

         23    business, but we could no longer do events at

         24    Red Lantern given the events that happened.



                                                             8

          1        Q.   Okay.  Did someone tell you you could

          2    no longer do events at Red Lantern?

          3        A.   It wasn't verbally expressed, but when

          4    I inquired about it, none of the inquiries were

          5    accepted.

          6        Q.   Okay.  So this event was the first and

          7    last event you did at Red Lantern, correct?

          8        A.   Correct.

          9        Q.   Okay.  And prior to this event at Red

         10    Lantern, how long had you been promoting other

         11    events at other establishments?

         12        A.   I want to say, prior to that, I had

         13    been promoting for about a year prior to that.

         14        Q.   And which other establishments were

         15    you promoting at?

         16        A.   I've done events at the W Lounge, GEM

         17    Lounge, Bijou Nightclub.  Those are the three.

         18    I've also done events at Naga Nightclub, now

         19    known as La Fábrica, and Savvor Lounge or

         20    Savvor Lounge.

         21        Q.   And you said --

         22        A.   Wonder Bar, sorry.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Now, you said that after this

         24    event at Red Lantern you did not promote any



                                                             9

          1    other events at Red Lantern but you did at GEM

          2    Lounge that was also owned by Big Night,

          3    correct?

          4        A.   Correct.

          5        Q.   And how long were you promoting after

          6    this event at GEM Lounge?

          7        A.   I want to say we promoted for about

          8    another -- for the remainder of the year.  And

          9    then after that, I think GEM Lounge eventually

         10    had a change of management and they also

         11    changed the venue itself.  It was now like an

         12    arcade bar or something like that called

         13    VERSUS, if I'm not mistaken.

         14        Q.   So when did you stop promoting with

         15    Big Night?

         16        A.   I mean, that's a good question.  I

         17    could look it up on my phone and probably pull

         18    up the last flyer that I posted for them.  That

         19    would tell me the exact date.

         20        Q.   If you want to do that, yes.

         21        A.   Let's see, the last event I did

         22    there -- so the last event that I have on

         23    record is May 14, 2018 -- well, actually, no,

         24    May 20, 2018.  Sorry about that.



                                                             10

          1        Q.   So it's fair to say that you stopped

          2    promoting with Big Night in the year 2018?

          3        A.   Correct.

          4        Q.   Okay.  And how many events do you

          5    think you've promoted with them, on average?

          6        A.   On average --

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        Q.   You can answer.

          9        A.   I was there like once a month for

         10    Fridays.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And on the night in question,

         12    so May 26, 2017, what was the arrangement with

         13    Red Lantern as far as your compensation for

         14    promoting the event?

         15             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         16        A.   I would get 100 percent of the door as

         17    well as a bar percentage.

         18        Q.   What was the bar percentage?

         19        A.   I don't remember that night.

         20        Q.   And when you say 100 percent of the

         21    door, was there a cover?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   And how much was the cover, do you

         24    remember?



                                                             11

          1        A.   I don't.  It ranged from about 10 to

          2    15 dollars.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Now, on that night, could

          4    patrons reserve VIP tables?

          5        A.   Correct.

          6        Q.   And how would they go about reserving

          7    a VIP table?

          8        A.   They'd either reach out to myself,

          9    say, hey, we have a party of, you know,

         10    so-and-so, and we'd provide them with a table

         11    minimum spend that they would have to pay at

         12    the end of the night.

         13        Q.   So what was the table minimum spend

         14    that night?

         15        A.   That, I don't remember.

         16        Q.   You don't remember, okay.

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   And could a patron reserve a VIP table

         19    any other way other than reaching out to you?

         20        A.   Yes.  They could also reach out to the

         21    location and touch base with management and

         22    inquire about one.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And do you know if there were

         24    any bottle specials on the night of the



                                                             12

          1    incident?

          2        A.   I do not remember that.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Now, do you know Mr. George

          4    Craan?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   And did you know Mr. George Craan

          7    prior to this incident?

          8        A.   Not personally, but I had seen him at

          9    my event at The W which was like a week or two

         10    prior.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And what is your current

         12    relationship with George?

         13        A.   Just casual.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Do you guys talk on a

         15    consistent basis?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   Okay.  Do you guys have each other's

         18    phone number?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   Okay.  And do you guys, like, reach

         21    out to each other to hang out?

         22        A.   No, but if he wanted to attend one of

         23    my events, he'd reach out.

         24        Q.   So you see him if it's at one of your



                                                             13

          1    events; is that fair to say?

          2        A.   Correct.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Now, on the night of the

          4    incident, did -- who booked the table that

          5    George was sitting at?

          6        A.   Alan.

          7        Q.   And do you know Alan's last name?

          8        A.   I do not.

          9        Q.   Okay.  And how do you know Alan?

         10        A.   Alan was the same gentleman who booked

         11    the table at The W through me when I had my

         12    event.

         13        Q.   Okay.  And was that the extent of your

         14    relationship with Alan?

         15        A.   Correct.

         16        Q.   Okay.

         17        A.   So this Red Lantern, that was only our

         18    second encounter.

         19        Q.   Okay.  Did you know anyone else in

         20    that party of people at Alan's table?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask you to

         23    jog back in your memory.  So where were you --

         24    let me go back.



                                                             14

          1             What time did you show up to the Red

          2    Lantern on that night?

          3        A.   That night, I want to say, I showed up

          4    around 9 p.m.

          5        Q.   Okay.  And was this before patrons

          6    would have been getting there?

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        A.   Yes.  We got there early for setup.

          9    We wanted to make sure our backdrop was set up

         10    that had our logo on it where people could take

         11    pictures in front of it.  I remember that

         12    taking a little bit of time to set up because I

         13    had never done one before, so we definitely got

         14    there roughly an hour before the doors opened.

         15        Q.   You said so that your logo -- what's

         16    your logo?

         17        A.   It's just our name.  It says "BENT."

         18        Q.   Is that the name of the promotion

         19    group?

         20        A.   Ballot Entertainment, but everybody

         21    knows it as BENT.

         22             MR. MCINNIS:  What was it?

         23        A.   B-A-L-L-O-T Entertainment, and people

         24    just called us BENT.



                                                             15

          1        Q.   And who is part of that group?

          2        A.   It's myself and my partner,

          3    Christopher Andrew.

          4        Q.   So you go there and you said you

          5    showed up at 9 p.m., correct?

          6        A.   Correct.

          7        Q.   To set up.  And what time did patrons

          8    start coming into the establishment?

          9             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         10        A.   I want to say around 10, 10:30 because

         11    that's when we opened doors.

         12        Q.   And did you have any expectation of

         13    how many people would be attending that event?

         14        A.   Based on our number of ticket sales,

         15    we did not.  I believe we had about 150 to 200

         16    tickets sold in advance, but those numbers

         17    ended up doubling the day of.

         18        Q.   And why did they double the day of?

         19        A.   Word of mouth.

         20        Q.   So could patrons --

         21        A.   Patrons could purchase tickets at the

         22    door.

         23        Q.   At the door, okay.

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                             16

          1        Q.   And at any point, did you know the

          2    total count of how many people were there that

          3    night?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Okay.  But your compensation was based

          6    on the door sales, right, or the ticket sales?

          7        A.   Correct.

          8        Q.   Okay.  So there would have had to have

          9    been some kind of tally of how many ticket

         10    sales at the door for you to know how much you

         11    were supposed to be compensated, correct?

         12        A.   Right, but no one counts that for me.

         13    We kind of just collect the money.  I pay

         14    whoever I have to pay for their service,

         15    whether it be any sub promoters or the DJs.

         16    Yeah, I think that's about it.

         17        Q.   So who collects the money at the door?

         18    Is it someone from your --

         19        A.   It's myself.

         20        Q.   Okay.  So it wasn't Red Lantern that

         21    collected the money?

         22        A.   No, no.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Now, who hired the DJ that

         24    night?



                                                             17

          1        A.   We did.

          2        Q.   Okay.  So were there -- was there only

          3    one DJ?

          4        A.   No.  There were, if I'm not mistaken,

          5    three DJs.

          6        Q.   And who were the DJs?

          7        A.   We had a gentleman by the name of DJ

          8    Gurdy, G-U-R-D-Y, and the Super Smash Brothers,

          9    and I'll have to look at the flyer for the

         10    third one.  Hold on a second.

         11             No, it was actually those two.  The

         12    Super Smash Group, there's two in their group,

         13    so three in total.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And then who pays the DJs?

         15        A.   I do.

         16        Q.   Okay.  And when do you usually pay the

         17    DJs?  Is it the same night?

         18        A.   Yes, the same night.

         19        Q.   Okay.  Now, do you remember paying DJ

         20    Gurdy that night?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   And where did you meet him to pay him?

         23        A.   I usually meet the DJs at the DJ booth

         24    and I pay them -- I attempt to pay them before



                                                             18

          1    the night is over, so before it gets too busy

          2    or before they leave.

          3        Q.   Now, were the three DJs, were they

          4    performing together, or did they have different

          5    sets?

          6        A.   Different sets.

          7        Q.   So who performed first?

          8        A.   DJ Gurdy.

          9        Q.   Okay.  So then do you pay DJ Gurdy

         10    after his set or at the end of the night?

         11        A.   Basically, at the end of the night.

         12             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         13        Q.   And your memory is that you would have

         14    paid him at the DJ booth, or could there have

         15    been any other place that you paid him?

         16             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         17        A.   There could have been a different

         18    place.  That part of it is foggy, but I know

         19    for a fact I paid both -- like, all the DJs

         20    before we left that night.

         21        Q.   All right.  So as the patrons start

         22    coming in around 10, 10:30, where were you when

         23    they first started coming in?

         24        A.   Usually at the door, I greet them or



                                                             19

          1    working outside, working the line, kind of in

          2    and out.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Now, when someone reserves a

          4    table, do you show them to their table?

          5        A.   Now, I do.  Then, I don't remember who

          6    showed them to their table.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Now, at any point in time, were

          8    you inside the venue?

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   Okay.  And usually during the course

         11    of the night, where are you located?

         12             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         13        Q.   On that day?

         14        A.   Next to the DJ booth.  We had a table

         15    next to the DJ.

         16        Q.   Okay.  All right.  So I'm just going

         17    to ask you to draw here, if you can draw --

         18    just draw the dance floor.

         19        A.   Okay.  Dance floor would be in the

         20    middle.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Can you make an indication of

         22    where the front door is in relation to this.

         23        A.   Front door would probably be, like,

         24    diagonal.



                                                             20

          1        Q.   Can you just label it "front door."

          2        A.   Front door.

          3        Q.   Where is the DJ booth?

          4        A.   DJ booth is here overlooking the dance

          5    floor.

          6        Q.   And does that DJ booth face the dance

          7    floor?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   Okay.  And where was your table?

         10        A.   My table was here.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Can you just put a star or an

         12    asterisk in there so we know.

         13        A.   (Witness complies.)

         14        Q.   So where the asterisk is, that's where

         15    your table was?

         16        A.   Yeah.

         17        Q.   Okay.  Now, in relation to that, where

         18    was George and Alan's table?

         19        A.   George and Alan's table was on the

         20    opposite side.  So the two tables that, I

         21    guess, had an issue with one another were next

         22    to each other, so they were about here and

         23    here.  George being here, and then the other

         24    table being here.



                                                             21

          1        Q.   Okay.  So you're saying that there was

          2    an issue inside of the venue, correct, on that

          3    night?

          4             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          5        A.   Correct.

          6        Q.   Between two tables?

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        A.   Correct.

          9        Q.   So did you observe this issue inside

         10    of the club?

         11        A.   Yeah.  From my table I saw a commotion

         12    going on between the two tables.  I walked over

         13    there.  It was kind of not that big of a

         14    commotion.  They were both kind of taunting

         15    each other.  I basically went over there to

         16    calm them down before we got security involved

         17    because typically, if there's an issue at one

         18    of our events, before we get the necessary

         19    parties involved, we try to talk to the people

         20    ourselves basically and kind of see what's

         21    going on.

         22        Q.   So you say you see a commotion.  Can

         23    you describe this commotion?

         24        A.   Just dudes kind of talking at each



                                                             22

          1    other, you know, waving their hands.

          2        Q.   And you noticed this from your table?

          3        A.   Correct.

          4        Q.   Okay.  And did you see any security

          5    personnel near George's table or that other

          6    table?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   Okay.

          9        A.   I clearly remember that because I had

         10    to tap security to make them aware of the

         11    situation.

         12        Q.   Okay.  So your testimony is that you

         13    saw the commotion before security saw the

         14    commotion?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   And you made security aware of the

         17    commotion?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   And what was security's response when

         20    you made them aware of the commotion?

         21        A.   Well, there was a specific person that

         22    caused it.  It was actually on George's table.

         23    He had a friend that was too drunk.

         24             From my understanding -- actually,



                                                             23

          1    while I was standing there, he had fell over on

          2    a girl who I knew.  I can't remember her name

          3    off the top of my head, but he fell over on

          4    her, and then that kind of increased the

          5    commotion a bit.  I'm like, okay, this kid is

          6    too drunk and he has to leave.  I made security

          7    aware of that.  And from that point, I didn't

          8    see anything done.

          9        Q.   And when you say you didn't see

         10    anything done, what do you mean?

         11        A.   He was still in the party.

         12        Q.   Okay.  So did you suggest to security

         13    that he should leave?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Around what time did this

         16    happen?

         17        A.   I don't remember what time.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Was it before last call, after

         19    last call?

         20        A.   Before last call definitely.

         21        Q.   And you said it was George's friend

         22    that was -- you felt was intoxicated?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Now, when you go over to the



                                                             24

          1    tables, what do you do?

          2        A.   I talked to, basically, like Alan.

          3    Alan is the first person I looked for because

          4    he is the person I knew at the table.  And then

          5    I see George, and I was kind of like, hey,

          6    guys, what's going on.  Told them to calm down.

          7             And then I looked to the other table.

          8    I'm like, guys, what's going on, tell them to

          9    calm down.  They basically told me, hey, we're

         10    not here for this.  We're just here to have a

         11    good time.

         12        Q.   Who told you that?

         13        A.   The other table.

         14        Q.   Okay.

         15        A.   So I said cool and left it at that,

         16    but then within that mix, that's when George's

         17    friend kind of fell over into the girl.  And

         18    then after that, that's when I grabbed security

         19    and made them aware.

         20        Q.   Okay.  So after you alert security,

         21    you said -- you suggested that George's friend

         22    leave the venue?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   But he was still -- he remained in the



                                                             25

          1    club?

          2        A.   Correct.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Did you -- when you went to the

          4    table, was there any alcohol already at either

          5    of those tables?

          6             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          7        A.   Do you mean in terms of just on the

          8    tables?

          9        Q.   Yes.

         10        A.   At that moment, I don't remember.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And then what did you do after

         12    you alerted security?

         13        A.   I went back to my table.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Now, when you go back to your

         15    table, did you see any more alcohol being

         16    delivered to George's table?

         17        A.   No, not from where I was standing.

         18        Q.   And did you see any more alcohol being

         19    delivered to the other table?

         20        A.   No.  I didn't have a visual of the

         21    other table from my stance in the venue.

         22        Q.   Okay.  So at any point in the night,

         23    did you see alcohol being delivered to either

         24    one of those tables?



                                                             26

          1        A.   From where I was -- I mean, typically,

          2    throughout the night, especially when I'm

          3    working an event, I'm moving around a lot.  So

          4    it's not something I'm paying attention to if

          5    someone is getting served.  If they're getting

          6    served, I wouldn't see it.  The only people

          7    that I really see get served would be people

          8    that might be at my table or myself.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Did you see any individuals at

         10    George's table holding any bottles of alcohol?

         11             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         12        A.   Not that I remember.

         13        Q.   Okay.

         14        A.   From when I was over there.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Did you see any members of the

         16    other table holding any bottles of alcohol?

         17        A.   No, not when I was over there.

         18        Q.   Now, when you returned back to your

         19    table, did you see at any point -- how long did

         20    you stay at your table after that?

         21        A.   After that I want to say I stayed at

         22    my table probably for another, like, 30, 45

         23    minutes.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Were you at the table when



                                                             27

          1    people started leaving the venue?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Did you see George leave the

          4    venue?

          5        A.   No.  So prior -- actually, prior to

          6    people leaving, I spoke to Joe O'Connor that

          7    night who was actually my connection to booking

          8    the venue, and I made him aware of the

          9    situation that I told the security guard to

         10    remove the gentleman, he didn't, so there may

         11    be -- potentially be a situation when we're

         12    letting everyone out.

         13             So he then suggested that, okay, we'll

         14    let George's table out through the back, kind

         15    of separate them, and then the other table will

         16    be let out through the front with the remainder

         17    of the crowd.

         18        Q.   And this was Joe O'Connor, you said,

         19    that made that suggestion?

         20        A.   Yeah, because he wasn't aware of the

         21    situation until I made him aware, so that means

         22    security didn't tell him.

         23             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         24        Q.   Okay.  And so it's fair to say that



                                                             28

          1    when you told him, that was the first he was

          2    hearing of it?

          3             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          4        A.   That's what it seemed like, yeah.

          5        Q.   Okay.  And do you know what position

          6    Joe O'Connor has at Red Lantern?

          7        A.   Not at Red Lantern.  He was the GM at

          8    GEM Lounge.

          9        Q.   Okay.

         10        A.   But he was there to support me that

         11    night seeing as how he booked for me on my

         12    behalf.

         13        Q.   Okay.  So you didn't see security take

         14    George out the back; is that correct?

         15        A.   No, I did not see it, no.

         16        Q.   Okay.  And did you see the individuals

         17    from the other table leave out the front?

         18        A.   No.  It was kind of just a big crowd.

         19    They left before me.

         20        Q.   Who left before you?

         21        A.   Both parties left before I did.

         22        Q.   What time did you leave the venue?

         23        A.   I don't remember what time simply

         24    because when I was on my way out, the doors



                                                             29

          1    ended up getting closed because that's when the

          2    fight started happening.

          3        Q.   Okay.  So you didn't observe this --

          4    you say a fight?

          5        A.   Yeah.

          6        Q.   What's your understanding of what

          7    happened?

          8        A.   I mean, when the security guard came

          9    in, he actually had like a bloody eyebrow

         10    because he got hit in the face with something.

         11    He told me a kid threw a bottle of something at

         12    him.  And he was basically, like, there's a

         13    brawl going on outside right now.

         14        Q.   Do you know who the security guard

         15    was?

         16        A.   No, I don't remember his name.

         17        Q.   So did you witness the physical

         18    altercation outside?

         19        A.   No, I did not.

         20        Q.   Okay.  And other than the security

         21    personnel, did you have any conversations with

         22    anyone -- any employee of Red Lantern about

         23    this incident?

         24        A.   Not of Red Lantern, no.  I stayed in



                                                             30

          1    contact with Joe O'Connor, obviously, because

          2    we remain business partners.  We continue to do

          3    events.

          4        Q.   So did you have a conversation with

          5    Joe O'Connor about the incident or the

          6    altercation that happened that night?

          7        A.   Briefly, but I don't really remember

          8    the conversation.

          9        Q.   Okay.  So do you know what happened

         10    that night outside?

         11        A.   Yes.  So when I walked out there after

         12    they cleared the commotion, I saw an ambulance.

         13    I saw George holding his head, and then I

         14    forget who I asked what happened, but I was

         15    made aware that he was hit in the head with a

         16    bottle, with a champagne bottle at that.

         17        Q.   You don't know who made you aware of

         18    that?

         19        A.   No, I don't remember who it was

         20    because there was a lot going on.

         21        Q.   Do you remember if it was anybody of

         22    Big Night Entertainment Group?

         23        A.   No, not of Big Night, no.

         24        Q.   Okay.  So was it a patron?



                                                             31

          1        A.   Yeah, it could have been a patron that

          2    attended the party that was just outside.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And the conversation that you

          4    had with Joe O'Connor, what did he tell you, if

          5    anything, about this incident?

          6             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          7        A.   I mean, from what I remember, he told

          8    me that he let the guys out the back like he

          9    said he would.  He said they came back around

         10    to the front.  I'm not sure why they did.  And

         11    that's when the commotion happened because, you

         12    know, the streets weren't even cleared yet.

         13    You know, it was still the let out, so to

         14    speak, so there was still a lot of people

         15    outside.

         16             And typically, from my experience

         17    doing events, when you do a let out, it's

         18    security's job to clear the street and not let

         19    anybody else on that street until it's clear,

         20    and that didn't happen that night.

         21        Q.   What do you mean that didn't happen

         22    that night?

         23        A.   I mean, when I went out there -- I

         24    mean, not when I went out there, but it was



                                                             32

          1    just from the sound of it, sounded like there

          2    was a lot of people outside.

          3        Q.   All right.  Did you have any

          4    conversation with Joe O'Connor about who was

          5    involved in the physical altercation?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Now, you said that you stayed

          8    inside of the venue while people were exiting,

          9    correct?

         10        A.   Yeah, I got locked inside, yeah.

         11        Q.   Okay.  So did you observe any Red

         12    Lantern waitresses collecting bottles from the

         13    VIP tables?

         14             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         15        A.   I didn't observe that but that's --

         16    looking at the situation, that's probably the

         17    only way that anyone would have been able to

         18    leave with a champagne bottle at the venues.

         19             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         20        Q.   So what makes you think somebody was

         21    able to leave with a champagne bottle?

         22        A.   When they serve bottles, they're

         23    supposed to take it from the table whenever

         24    they're not at the table.  If somebody was able



                                                             33

          1    to get their hands on one, that would only

          2    explain -- the only thing that makes the most

          3    sense is that the waitress either forgot to

          4    take it with her or someone had it in hand and

          5    she didn't see it on the table to take it with

          6    her.  Probably the only two things that would

          7    probably make the most sense in regards to

          8    someone walking out with one.

          9        Q.   So during the course of the night, did

         10    you observe any alcohol bottles being left at

         11    any of the VIP tables?

         12        A.   No, not from my standpoint.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Did you observe the waitresses

         14    taking the bottles of alcohol from the tables?

         15        A.   From mine they did.  I mean, my

         16    waitress was different from the other

         17    waitresses.  I mean, my waitress was on her

         18    job, but it's a possibility that somebody could

         19    have messed up.

         20        Q.   Did you order any champagne at your

         21    table?

         22        A.   Not that I remember.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And you don't remember seeing

         24    any other table with champagne bottles on their



                                                             34

          1    table?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   Now, how did you come to the -- how

          4    were you made aware that the champagne bottle

          5    came from -- it was thought that the champagne

          6    bottle came from inside of the venue?

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        A.   I would say the time frame between the

          9    let out and just -- yeah, I would just say the

         10    time frame of the let out.  I mean, there's no

         11    way that someone would have got their hands on

         12    a champagne bottle that fast after exiting the

         13    venue.

         14        Q.   Okay.

         15        A.   Because we were still clearing the

         16    space unless they were, like, parked right

         17    outside, which is not a possibility.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Now, during the course of this

         19    night, did you witness any female patron

         20    getting punched in the face?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Did you have a conversation

         23    with anyone after this incident regarding a

         24    female patron getting punched in the face?



                                                             35

          1        A.   So the young lady who the gentleman

          2    fell on, I believe her name was Shaney,

          3    S-H-A-N-E-Y.  And yeah, like, when he fell on

          4    her, I don't recall him punching her in the

          5    face or them getting into an altercation, but I

          6    recall him definitely like hitting her pretty

          7    hard when he fell.

          8             But when I had left, I also heard that

          9    she got kicked out.  She got removed from the

         10    premises for actually fighting him.  And I

         11    spoke to her at a different event, and she told

         12    me that they kicked her out instead of him, and

         13    he was the one who started the whole thing.

         14        Q.   And this was George's friend?

         15        A.   George's friend.

         16        Q.   Not George?

         17        A.   Not George, no.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Did she ever tell you that she

         19    got punched in the face?

         20        A.   Not that I remember.

         21        Q.   Okay.  But she told you she got kicked

         22    out?

         23        A.   Yeah.

         24        Q.   Did she ever tell you that the -- did



                                                             36

          1    you guys ever talk about the physical

          2    altercation that happened outside?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Okay.  She never mentioned it to you?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   She never said that that happened

          7    because of her getting kicked out of the club?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any videos from

         10    that night?

         11        A.   I do, and I actually observed them

         12    before I came today to see if I could recall

         13    the night myself.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And what are the videos of?

         15        A.   Just of patrons partying, having a

         16    good time.

         17        Q.   How many videos do you have?

         18        A.   I have three, like, raw videos and one

         19    cut video.

         20        Q.   Do any of those videos show George's

         21    table?

         22        A.   No, not that I believe.

         23        Q.   Do any of the videos show the other

         24    table that was involved inside?



                                                             37

          1        A.   No.  It's kind of hard to see because

          2    it's pretty dark, so you can literally only see

          3    the crowd of people in front of the DJ booth.

          4        Q.   Do you have any photos from that

          5    night?

          6        A.   I do not.

          7        Q.   No photos.  So when did you collect

          8    your money from the venue?

          9        A.   Joe had a check cut for me, but I'm

         10    not sure when after the event I collected it,

         11    but it was after the event had already

         12    happened.

         13        Q.   Okay.  So it wasn't on the same day?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   Have you seen any videos from that

         16    night other than the ones that you have?  Have

         17    you seen any videos -- maybe I should be more

         18    specific.

         19             Have you seen any videos of the

         20    physical altercation from that night?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   And who showed you those videos?

         23        A.   George.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Other than George showing you



                                                             38

          1    that video, did anyone else show you a video?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And let me ask this, after the

          4    incident, did you have an opportunity to speak

          5    with George?

          6        A.   Yes.  He actually stopped by one of my

          7    events where he showed me the video and asked

          8    me if I knew any of the guys who he had gotten

          9    into an altercation with, if I knew anybody

         10    from the neighboring table.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And what was your answer to

         12    him?

         13        A.   I told him I didn't know anyone.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Was that the only time you

         15    spoke to George about the incident?

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And other than Joe O'Connor,

         18    did you have any conversations with anyone from

         19    either Red Lantern or Big Night about this

         20    incident?

         21        A.   No, not about the incident itself.

         22        Q.   All right.  Have you spoken to Red

         23    Lantern's attorney about this incident?

         24        A.   No.



                                                             39

          1        Q.   Have you spoken with someone, an

          2    attorney from my office about this incident,

          3    either myself or Attorney Sania Santos?

          4        A.   Just you.

          5        Q.   Okay.  And has anyone from Big Night

          6    tried to reach out to you in regards to this

          7    incident?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   And who was that?

         10        A.   I've got to look it up.  Somebody

         11    named Doug.

         12             MR. MCINNIS:  I'm Doug.

         13        Q.   So you got an email from Doug?

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And was that the only contact

         16    that you got?

         17        A.   And Jamie Pollock, director of

         18    operations.

         19        Q.   Okay.  And did you ever speak with

         20    Jamie?

         21        A.   Yeah.  I'm trying to see what I said

         22    to him.  Yeah, he was asking me if I had any

         23    video from the incident that happened outside,

         24    and I responded I didn't and I didn't see it



                                                             40

          1    because I was locked inside.

          2        Q.   Okay.  And that's all he asked you?

          3        A.   Uh-huh.

          4        Q.   Okay.  All right.  I'm going to show

          5    you two videos of the altercation that happened

          6    outside.  Okay?

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9        Q.   So I'm going to show you this first

         10    video.  If you could tell me if you've seen

         11    this video before?

         12        A.   This is the video that George showed

         13    me.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Do you recognize any of these

         15    men as any of the patrons at that neighboring

         16    table?

         17        A.   I can't see from this footage, but

         18    from his cell phone footage, I was able to tell

         19    that that was the neighboring table.

         20        Q.   Okay.  How were you able to tell that

         21    that was the neighboring table?

         22        A.   Just by face.

         23        Q.   Okay.  I'm going to play this again.

         24    Any of these individuals in the suits -- do you



                                                             41

          1    see Joe O'Connor in any of these videos?

          2        A.   I think that was Joe right there, if

          3    I'm not mistaken.

          4        Q.   Okay.  Actually, I think I can turn

          5    the brightness up if that works.  Let me play

          6    it one more time.

          7        A.   Yeah, I think that was Joe right

          8    there.

          9        Q.   Okay.  So you recognize Joe in this

         10    video?

         11        A.   Yeah, the guy with the suit on.

         12        Q.   Okay.  And then I'm going to show you

         13    this video, see if you can -- I know the videos

         14    are kind of blurry, but do any of these

         15    individuals look like anybody that was at the

         16    neighboring table, any of the individuals that

         17    you see in this video?

         18        A.   It's very blurry.  I can't tell on

         19    that video.

         20        Q.   But you said the previous video I

         21    showed you, that's the same video that you saw

         22    on George's cell phone?

         23        A.   Yeah.  I saw a clearer version of that

         24    on George's cell phone when he showed me, yeah.



                                                             42

          1        Q.   And you identified individuals in that

          2    video as being individuals of the neighboring

          3    table inside of Red Lantern that night?

          4        A.   Correct.  Yeah.

          5        Q.   Okay.  I'm just going to remove this

          6    flash drive, and we can mark this as Exhibit 2.

          7                  (Exhibit 2, Flash Drive, so

          8                  marked.)

          9             MS. ALVES:  I'll get an envelope for

         10    it.

         11        Q.   So I just want to make sure I asked

         12    you this.  You didn't observe any bottles of

         13    alcohol being delivered to either George's

         14    table or the neighboring table, correct?

         15        A.   I did not observe that, no.

         16             MS. ALVES:  And we're going to mark

         17    this as Exhibit No. 3.  Okay.  That's all I

         18    have for you.

         19                  (Exhibit 3, Hand-drawn diagram,

         20                  so marked.)

         22                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED

         23    BY MR. MCINNIS:

         24        Q.   I have some questions for you.  I'm



                                                             43

          1    Doug McInnis.  I represent Big Night

          2    Entertainment/Red Lantern in this case.

          3             You indicated that I sent you on email

          4    at some point?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   And you did receive it?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   I think I simply asked you to give me

          9    a call?

         10        A.   Let me see.  Yeah, you basically told

         11    me that you received my contact information

         12    from Jamie.  It says -- you can read it right

         13    here.

         14             MS. ALVES:  Do you want to read it

         15    into the record, Doug?

         16             MR. MCINNIS:  Sure.

         17        Q.   "I represent Big Night in a lawsuit

         18    arising from a fight that occurred outside of

         19    Red Lantern on May 27, 2017.  I was given your

         20    contact information by Jamie Pollock.  The

         21    plaintiff in this case has noticed your

         22    deposition and likely serving you with a

         23    subpoena.  Please contact me as soon as you can

         24    to discuss."



                                                             44

          1        A.   Uh-huh.

          2        Q.   You received that email, correct?

          3        A.   Correct.

          4        Q.   How come you didn't call?

          5        A.   I mean, I was trying to, honestly,

          6    remove myself from the situation, seeing as how

          7    I didn't physically see the altercation.  I

          8    didn't think my voice would really matter too

          9    much in the case.

         10        Q.   Okay.  Did you speak to -- upon

         11    receipt of that email or the subpoena, did you

         12    contact George Craan?

         13        A.   No.  I saw him at an event that I held

         14    a few days ago.

         15        Q.   Just recently?

         16        A.   Yeah, on Sunday.

         17        Q.   Where was that event?

         18        A.   It was at Casa Caña in Brighton,

         19    Massachusetts.

         20        Q.   Is that that brunch thing you do?

         21        A.   Yeah, correct.

         22        Q.   What is that event like?  What do you

         23    do at that event?  You serve breakfast?

         24        A.   Yeah, it's like a day party with



                                                             45

          1    breakfast.

          2        Q.   Do you do bottle service at that event

          3    as well?

          4        A.   Champagne only, yeah.

          5        Q.   And how long have you been running

          6    that event?

          7        A.   I would say since Memorial Day.  I've

          8    done it about twice a month since then.

          9        Q.   So this is a relatively new project?

         10        A.   Correct.  Correct.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Have you seen George at it

         12    multiple times?

         13        A.   Yeah, I saw him a few times.

         14        Q.   Do you see him at any other events

         15    that you do other than the brunch?

         16        A.   Yeah, I see him once in a while.  One

         17    time I saw him at an event at Elixir Lounge one

         18    summer.  I see him once in the blue he comes

         19    out.

         20        Q.   Does he do bottle service in that type

         21    of thing?

         22        A.   Not that I've seen, no.  He just kind

         23    of hangs out, grabs a drink at the bar.

         24        Q.   Did you speak to George about this



                                                             46

          1    deposition?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And what was the substance of

          4    that conversation, please?

          5        A.   It was a brief discussion.  I made him

          6    aware that I had received a subpoena, and he

          7    told me to give him a call prior just so that

          8    we could just talk about the night, but we

          9    didn't have an actual conversation prior.  I

         10    just came in.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Did you talk to any of --

         12    either of his attorneys about the night prior

         13    to this deposition?

         14        A.   Prior, yes, I just spoke to Ms. Alves.

         15        Q.   When did you speak with Ms. Alves?

         16        A.   I don't remember.  It was, I'm going

         17    to say, roughly, about a month or so ago.

         18        Q.   And that was after you were served

         19    with the subpoena or before?

         20        A.   Before.  Yeah, it was prior.

         21        Q.   And what was the substance of your

         22    conversation?

         23        A.   Just a high-level discussion on what I

         24    remember from the night.



                                                             47

          1        Q.   Did you provide a written statement or

          2    provide an affidavit or anything like that?

          3        A.   No, it was just a discussion.

          4        Q.   Do you know if the discussion was

          5    recorded?

          6        A.   No, not aware of that.

          7        Q.   Okay.  When you say "high level,"

          8    could you give me a little bit more detail?

          9        A.   Simply what we discussed today.  She

         10    asked what I remembered.  I provided her with

         11    basically the same, similar details that we

         12    spoke on today.  I don't remember it from

         13    detail by detail.

         14        Q.   When you spoke to George just recently

         15    about the deposition, did you ask him why he

         16    was dragging you into this?

         17        A.   No, I didn't ask him why.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Did you ask him to leave you

         19    out of it?

         20        A.   I told him I would prefer to be left

         21    out of it, yeah.

         22        Q.   And did you tell him that just

         23    recently?

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                             48

          1        Q.   Did he tell you that you might

          2    ultimately have to come testify at trial?

          3        A.   No, he didn't tell me that.

          4        Q.   Do you have a Massachusetts driver's

          5    license?

          6        A.   Not on me.  I just have my passport.

          7        Q.   Is it a valid driver's license?

          8        A.   It expired on my birthday, so I have

          9    to get it renewed.

         10        Q.   When was that?

         11        A.   June 24.

         12        Q.   They've got all kinds of new rules

         13    about that.  I've got to do it myself.  I'm

         14    trying to find my passport, crazy.

         15             So June 24, 1990, right?

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   Has your license ever been suspended

         18    or revoked?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   Okay.  When did you form BENT

          9        Q.   Christopher Andrew?

         10        A.   Uh-huh.

         11        Q.   And was he your partner the entire

         12    time this business was formed?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   Is he still your partner?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   What was his last name again?

         24        A.   I don't remember.  He was kind of



                                                             50

          1    floating around.

          2        Q.   Was he seated next to Mr. Craan?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Was he seated with Mr. Craan?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   Do you know if he had a table reserved

          7    somewhere?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Aside from Mr. Craan, could you name

         10    everyone that was seated at his table?

         11        A.   No.

         12        Q.   Can you name any of them?

         13        A.   All I know is his associate, Alan.

         14        Q.   Okay.

         15        A.   Was the one -- the gentleman I

         16    actually knew before Mr. Craan.

         17        Q.   You had mentioned on the night in

         18    question, May 27, 2017, that you saw some sort

         19    of altercation or scuffle, however you want to

         20    define it?

         21        A.   Right.

         22        Q.   So you went to investigate?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   And you say -- I think you said that



                                                             51

          1    you'd like to investigate before security; is

          2    that fair to say?

          3        A.   Right.

          4        Q.   Why?

          5        A.   Simply because I would prefer people

          6    to continue to have a good time as opposed to

          7    the night being ruined by one individual.

          8    Sometimes it can be diffused by a simple

          9    discussion, but if I observe the situation as a

         10    threat to my event, then I pull in security to

         11    do their job.

         12        Q.   So you felt that George Craan's friend

         13    was a threat to the event?

         14        A.   Correct.

         15        Q.   What's George Craan's friend's name

         16    that you thought was a threat?

         17        A.   I don't know.

         18        Q.   Do you know Quincy Giles?

         19        A.   I do not.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Do you know Jeslyn Baptiste?

         21        A.   I do know him now, actually, yeah.

         22        Q.   He's kind of a buddy of Alan's?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Was it Jeslyn that was falling on the



                                                             52

          1    floor?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   Do you know if the individual that was

          4    with Mr. Craan was related to Mr. Craan?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   Do you know if he was his cousin?

          7        A.   I have no idea.

          8        Q.   Did you ever ask Mr. Craan who this

          9    person was?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Not even after the fight, after you

         12    saw the video?

         13        A.   I mean, I do recall us having a brief

         14    conversation about -- he did say it was a

         15    friend of his.  I think he said he had just

         16    done some time, he just got let out, it was his

         17    first time out, and that was the last

         18    discussion I remember about that.

         19        Q.   So this individual that he brought

         20    with him, you don't know his name?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   But Mr. Craan alerted you that he had

         23    just gotten out of prison?

         24        A.   Right, after the fact.



                                                             53

          1        Q.   But you learned from Mr. Craan that

          2    his friend had been in prison?

          3        A.   Correct.

          4        Q.   And had recently been released; is

          5    that correct?

          6        A.   Correct.

          7        Q.   And this was the first time this

          8    individual is out at an event?

          9        A.   Correct.

         10        Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me what that

         11    individual was wearing?

         12        A.   I don't remember exactly, but I know

         13    he had a white T-shirt on.

         14        Q.   Do you have a dress code for your

         15    events?

         16        A.   Typically, we do, but for this event

         17    we were being a bit lenient because it was a

         18    graduation event.  Some students might come

         19    dressed down that had just freshly graduated,

         20    and we were being a little bit more lenient at

         21    the door.

         22        Q.   Why do you have a dress code?

         23        A.   Simply to hold an event to a certain

         24    standard.



                                                             54

          1        Q.   Okay.  What do you mean?

          2        A.   I would say like a young professional

          3    standard, so to speak.

          4        Q.   So you want people to kind of look

          5    sharp?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   Because you think that brings a

          8    certain type of folks; is that fair to say?

          9             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         10        A.   No, I wouldn't say it brings a certain

         11    type of folks.

         12        Q.   Okay.  You got to decide what the

         13    dress code was that night, correct?

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   And you decided to make it lenient?

         16        A.   Yeah.

         17        Q.   Were there a lot of people who were

         18    dressed down?

         19        A.   No.  The majority actually dressed up

         20    for the most part.

         21        Q.   Okay.

         22        A.   There were a few people that were lax.

         23        Q.   Do you have any rules about particular

         24    colors?



                                                             55

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember what Mr. Craan

          3    was wearing?

          4        A.   I don't remember what he was wearing.

          5        Q.   Well, you just saw the video.  Do you

          6    remember what he was wearing in the video?

          7             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

          8        A.   I mean, if you played the video again,

          9    I could tell you.

         10             MR. MCINNIS:  Sure.  Could you play

         11    that video again, please?

         12                  (Playing video.)

         13        A.   It's like a white T-shirt and a red

         14    hoodie.

         15        Q.   White T-shirt?

         16        A.   Yeah.

         17        Q.   So he was kind of wearing the same

         18    shirt as his friend?

         19        A.   Yeah.

         20        Q.   And a red sweatshirt?

         21        A.   Yeah.

         22        Q.   Okay.  And that's not the standard you

         23    would normally go for?

         24        A.   Not normally but we have events --



                                                             56

          1    like I said, we have events where we're lenient

          2    and not too picky on dress code.  As long as

          3    people aren't giving us an issue and having a

          4    good time, it's okay with us.

          5        Q.   What do you mean give you an issue?

          6        A.   As long as they don't cause fights or

          7    commotions, we're still happy.

          8        Q.   Are you suggesting that if somebody is

          9    dressed down, they're more likely to cause a

         10    fight?

         11        A.   No.

         12        Q.   What do you mean?

         13        A.   I'm suggesting that if someone is

         14    dressed down that -- a person in a suit could

         15    cause a fight.  It really doesn't matter to us.

         16    For the most part, our audience just comes out

         17    to have a good time.

         18        Q.   But you had mentioned that because

         19    of -- that was one of your concerns, you don't

         20    worry about the dress code if they're going to

         21    behave themselves?

         22        A.   Yeah, as long as people behave

         23    themselves, we don't order the dress code.  So

         24    the dress code doesn't indicate that someone



                                                             57

          1    wouldn't behave to us.

          2        Q.   So that's not a factor for you?

          3        A.   Un-unh.

          4        Q.   So why have a dress code?

          5        A.   I would say dress code would depend on

          6    the venue that you're hosting the event at.  So

          7    if we were to do an event at The W, I mean,

          8    there's a certain standard that The W would

          9    enforce or would expect of us or of our

         10    audience.  So they'd say, hey, make sure your

         11    audience comes presentable, and we present that

         12    product to them.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Was Red Lantern the original

         14    venue that you were going to hold this event?

         15        A.   No, The W was.

         16        Q.   Okay.  And was it scheduled for the

         17    same night?

         18        A.   Yeah.

         19        Q.   Why did it not go forward at The W?

         20        A.   I honestly do not remember why it

         21    didn't go forward at The W.  And I think it had

         22    something to do with my point of contact who

         23    was at The W for the previous event leaving.

         24        Q.   Who was that?



                                                             58

          1        A.   I can't remember her name.

          2        Q.   Okay.  You had a previous event at The

          3    W Hotel?

          4        A.   Yes.

          5        Q.   Were there any fights?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Any issues?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Any complaints?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Okay.  So when did you find out that

         12    you lost The W venue?

         13        A.   I believe it was the week of.

         14        Q.   Okay.  So it was very close in time?

         15        A.   Yeah.

         16        Q.   So you kind of had to scramble?

         17        A.   Yeah.

         18        Q.   Any particular reason you didn't have

         19    it at GEM?  Were they booked with something

         20    else?

         21        A.   I don't remember.  I don't remember.

         22    I think it might have been not necessarily

         23    because they were booked, but probably because

         24    they were too small for what we were expecting.



                                                             59

          1        Q.   And how big -- so was it originally

          2    scheduled at GEM and then moved over to Red

          3    Lantern?

          4        A.   No, it was originally scheduled at The

          5    W, and then I got the okay from Joe to leverage

          6    Red Lantern because I told him we were

          7    expecting a big crowd.

          8        Q.   Okay.  When you arrived on the night

          9    in question, you said you came around 9:00?

         10        A.   Roughly, yeah.

         11        Q.   It was already opened for business,

         12    correct?

         13        A.   Yes.  Everybody was sitting down

         14    eating.  The restaurant was still serving food.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Did most of those patrons clear

         16    out by the time your event started?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Now, could somebody buy a

         19    ticket to the event electronically?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   Okay.  And would they have to bring

         22    something with a bar code or something like

         23    that?

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                             60

          1        Q.   What service do you use for that?

          2        A.   Tablelist.

          3        Q.   All right.  And you could also pay at

          4    the door?

          5        A.   Correct.

          6        Q.   Okay.  So you were at the front door

          7    when the event opened to the public?

          8        A.   Correct.

          9        Q.   And you were checking to see if people

         10    had bar codes?

         11        A.   Correct.  Well, actually, I do have a

         12    door girl that does that.

         13        Q.   Who is that, please?

         14        A.   Her name is Tahira.

         15        Q.   Can you say it one more time?

         16        A.   Tahira, T-A-H-I-R-A.  Did I spell that

         17    right?  I'm sorry.  Let me make sure.

         18        Q.   What is her last name?

         19        A.   Gibson, G-I-B-S-O-N.

         20        Q.   And what's her phone number?

         21        A.   Say it again.

         22        Q.   Her phone number, please?

         23        A.   Her phone number is 781-686-4248.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Do you know if she witnessed



                                                             61

          1    this altercation or not?

          2        A.   I'm not sure, no.

          3        Q.   Did you ever ask her?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Would she have gone home by this

          6    point?

          7        A.   Yeah.

          8        Q.   So you think she was already long

          9    gone?

         10        A.   Yeah.

         11        Q.   Where does she live?  Do you have her

         12    address?

         13        A.   I do not.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And what does she do for you;

         15    she just collects money?

         16        A.   Yeah, she works the door for our

         17    events from time to time, and she also helps

         18    promote.

         19        Q.   So she would be what you'd call a sub

         20    promoter?

         21        A.   Yeah, she isn't an official partner

         22    like my partner Christopher Andrew, but she

         23    does assist with events.

         24        Q.   Could you tell me exactly what a



                                                             62

          1    promoter is?

          2        A.   A promoter is someone who invites

          3    individuals out to an event, whether that be

          4    via text, email, or social media, and it's

          5    their job to sell tickets and either get a

          6    percentage or get compensated 100 percent of

          7    the amount of tickets that they sell.  Their

          8    job also entails booking tables as well.

          9        Q.   So how many promoters do you employ?

         10        A.   Currently, right now, two.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Were these two promoters

         12    promoters you were using for this event in

         13    2017?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   Who were you using in 2017?

         16        A.   It was just Christopher Andrew and I.

         17        Q.   Just the two of you were handling it?

         18        A.   Yeah.

         19        Q.   And what about Ms. Gibson, was she

         20    doing it, too?

         21        A.   Yeah, she did invite folks, but she

         22    wasn't an official promoter.

         23        Q.   You had mentioned that you paid sub

         24    promoters that night?



                                                             63

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   There was no sub promoters?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Just the two of you?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   And the DJs?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Did you have to pay anybody else?

          9        A.   The door girl, obviously.

         10        Q.   Anybody else?

         11        A.   And that was it.

         12        Q.   Okay.  You mentioned you paid DJ Gurdy

         13    at some point?

         14        A.   Uh-huh.

         15        Q.   Is that correct?

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   DJ Gurdy, do you know what his real

         18    name is?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   How did you find him?

         21        A.   He was actually recommended by

         22    Ms. Gibson because we needed an additional DJ

         23    that catered to the collegiate audience.

         24        Q.   And what qualifications did he have to



                                                             64

          1    meet that?

          2        A.   He had a resume of just doing college

          3    parties at the time.

          4        Q.   Okay.  And have you used him since?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   Is there a particular reason why?

          7        A.   Yeah, I think he blew one of the

          8    speakers, if I'm not mistaken.

          9        Q.   Would that be a speaker you owned?

         10        A.   No, a speaker of Red Lantern's.

         11        Q.   Is that why you stopped using him?

         12        A.   Yes.

         13        Q.   I mean, could that just be an

         14    accident, or is that just lack of skill?

         15        A.   I mean, I wasn't too impressed with

         16    his music either, so I would say both.

         17        Q.   You didn't like his style?

         18        A.   Yeah.

         19        Q.   Okay.  You mentioned you had the Smash

         20    Brothers as well?

         21        A.   Uh-huh.

         22        Q.   Is that correct?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   So after DJ Gurdy finished, did the



                                                             65

          1    Smash Brothers go on?  Was that the plan?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   And that's what happened?

          4        A.   Yes.

          5        Q.   What time did the Smash Brothers go

          6    on?

          7        A.   I don't recall.  I want to say

          8    probably closer to midnight.

          9        Q.   Okay.  What time would you estimate

         10    when you saw that scuffle over at Alan's table?

         11        A.   I don't remember.  It was definitely

         12    at the peak of the night though.

         13        Q.   Would you remember who was playing

         14    music at that point?

         15        A.   No.

         16        Q.   Okay.  Have you used the Smash

         17    Brothers again?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Okay.  How much did you pay DJ Gurdy?

         20        A.   I don't remember for that night, nor

         21    do I remember how much I paid the Smash

         22    Brothers.

         23        Q.   You paid them in cash?

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                             66

          1        Q.   Is that the cash you took in at the

          2    door?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So when you opened the venue,

          5    you're at the front door with your door person?

          6        A.   Uh-huh.

          7        Q.   Is that correct?

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9        Q.   Yes?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   Okay.  She's collecting the cash and

         12    the tickets?

         13        A.   Uh-huh.

         14        Q.   Is that correct?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   What are you doing while you're out

         17    there, just greeting people?

         18        A.   Yeah, I'm greeting people, observing.

         19    I may go out to either greet specific people

         20    that I know to help walk them in, get past the

         21    line, you know, what have you, so I'm pretty

         22    much just floating.

         23        Q.   Do you ever stay outside and decide

         24    whether somebody can come into your event or



                                                             67

          1    not?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   You never turn anyone away?

          4        A.   No, I don't turn anyone away.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   That's usually up to -- that's the

          7    security at any event they use discretion if

          8    they want to turn somebody away.

          9        Q.   I just mean if you didn't like

         10    somebody, or if there looked like people were

         11    starting a fight in line, you wouldn't let them

         12    come into the party.

         13        A.   I didn't observe any of that.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Did you see George in the line?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   Okay.  Did you bring him out and

         17    around so he can get in earlier?

         18        A.   I don't remember that.  I do remember

         19    him and his gentlemen getting checked in.  If

         20    I'm not mistaken, it might have been Joe that

         21    walked them in because Joe was helping out with

         22    the VIP tables.

         23             There was a separate line.  There was

         24    the general admission line and then there was



                                                             68

          1    the VIP line of people that had tables booked

          2    in advance.

          3        Q.   Do you remember if George was on the

          4    VIP line or the general admission line?

          5        A.   The VIP line.

          6        Q.   Was he in line with Alan Dorr?

          7        A.   Yeah.

          8        Q.   Okay.  Did you talk to George Craan

          9    that night at all?

         10        A.   No, I didn't really, like, know him

         11    that well.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Were you running any particular

         13    packages that night?

         14        A.   Not that I remember.

         15        Q.   What type of packages do you run?

         16        A.   We typically do a hard liquor and a

         17    champagne for a specific price.

         18        Q.   What would be the price?  Does it

         19    fluctuate?

         20        A.   Yeah, it ranges.

         21        Q.   Generally, what is it?

         22        A.   I would say around, like, 400 to 500

         23    dollars.

         24        Q.   And what would a 400 or 500 get you?



                                                             69

          1        A.   It would get you either a bottle of

          2    hard liquor and a champagne or two hard liquors

          3    for, I guess, the higher price.

          4        Q.   What would be the champagne?  Is there

          5    anything in particular?

          6        A.   It's generally Belaire.

          7        Q.   Is there other options?

          8        A.   Not that we include, no.

          9        Q.   Okay.  You mentioned earlier that you

         10    had learned at some point that somebody was --

         11    or that George was struck with a champagne

         12    bottle?

         13        A.   Uh-huh.

         14        Q.   Is that correct?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   Do you remember who told you that he

         17    was struck with a champagne bottle?

         18        A.   I don't remember who told me.  It was

         19    one of the patrons outside that just observed

         20    it.

         21        Q.   So you did not observe it?

         22        A.   No, because I was locked inside.

         23        Q.   Did you go outside and look and see

         24    what type of broken glass was on the ground?



                                                             70

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   So you don't know if it was a

          3    champagne bottle or not personally?

          4        A.   Personally, I don't, no.

          5        Q.   So you're just basing that

          6    understanding on something somebody else told

          7    you?

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9        Q.   Is that correct?

         10        A.   Uh-huh.

         11        Q.   You've got to say yes.

         12        A.   Yes.  Sorry.  I forgot about that.

         13        Q.   You mentioned something about a peak

         14    of the night --

         15        A.   Uh-huh.

         16        Q.   -- just a moment ago.  What is the

         17    peak of the night?

         18        A.   Peak of the night is usually when we

         19    hit capacity.  We close the doors and everybody

         20    is kind of just in there having a good time.

         21    Usually when our best DJs are on, so I would

         22    say peak of the night would probably range

         23    around, like, 11:30 to 12ish time.

         24        Q.   So right around the time the Smash



                                                             71

          1    Brothers would have went on?

          2        A.   Possibly.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Well, I mean, was DJ Gurdy the

          4    peak of the night?

          5        A.   No, but we still --

          6        Q.   He was the lull of the night, right?

          7        A.   Yeah, we still had a pretty packed

          8    house with him on though.

          9        Q.   Now, were you drinking that night?

         10        A.   Not really, no.

         11        Q.   Okay.  So you would say you were not

         12    intoxicated?

         13        A.   Yeah.

         14        Q.   Okay.  You were seated at your table,

         15    and you said you would rove around; is that

         16    correct?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Do you know how many security guards

         19    were working that night?

         20        A.   Not that I remember, no.

         21        Q.   Would you say it was over five?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   Would you say it was over ten?

         24        A.   That, I don't know.



                                                             72

          1        Q.   Okay.  So at least over five?

          2        A.   Yeah.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And where were they located in

          4    the venue?

          5        A.   They were spread out, spread

          6    throughout.

          7        Q.   Were they roving as well?

          8        A.   Not that I saw.  I saw a few kind of

          9    just standing around.

         10        Q.   Did you speak to any of the security

         11    guards that night?

         12        A.   Yes, when I saw the commotion

         13    happening.

         14        Q.   How about earlier?

         15        A.   Earlier, no.

         16        Q.   Did you tap any of the security

         17    guards?

         18        A.   No.

         19        Q.   Do you ever do that?

         20        A.   No.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Do you ever have your own

         22    security come with you?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Did you do that that night?



                                                             73

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Why do you have your own security with

          3    you?

          4        A.   I would only provide security to a

          5    venue that doesn't have security.  So for

          6    example, Casa Caña doesn't have security, so

          7    they gave me the opportunity to contract my own

          8    guys.

          9        Q.   Who do you use?

         10        A.   I use a gentleman by the name of

         11    Angel, Angel's Security, and they also work at

         12    Karma Lounge.

         13        Q.   So Angel Security?

         14        A.   Uh-huh.

         15        Q.   And what does Angel Security provide

         16    you?

         17        A.   They usually provide me with six to

         18    eight gentlemen.

         19        Q.   How much does that cost you?

         20        A.   I would say, roughly, anywhere between

         21    11 to 1,300.

         22        Q.   And how many people do you expect at

         23    the events when you use Angel Security?

         24        A.   I'm going to say around 200.  Anywhere



                                                             74

          1    between 2- and 250.

          2        Q.   And that's adequate?

          3        A.   Yeah.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So you did see security on the

          5    night in question, and you saw them around?

          6        A.   Spread throughout.

          7        Q.   Spread throughout?

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9        Q.   And you say you were -- you saw

         10    something going on near George's table?

         11        A.   Yes.

         12        Q.   Okay.  And you say that you went over

         13    to investigate; you wanted to see if you could

         14    handle it, get it under control?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   You don't want any fights at your

         17    establishments; you want a safe environment?

         18        A.   Correct.

         19        Q.   So you went over there and you tried

         20    to calm things down.  Did you have to go back a

         21    second time, or did you just go once?

         22        A.   I don't remember going back a second

         23    time.  I remember going that one time.

         24        Q.   So you went over the one time.  And



                                                             75

          1    who did you speak to when you went over?

          2        A.   At first I spoke to -- I believe I

          3    spoke to the gentleman in question who was

          4    intoxicated.

          5        Q.   So George's friend?

          6        A.   Yeah.

          7        Q.   Okay.  What did you say to him?

          8        A.   I just told him to calm down.  And

          9    then I kind of just -- you know, because he

         10    looked like he was taunting the other table.

         11    The tables were kind of taunting each other,

         12    but he was kind of in between the tables.

         13        Q.   You would say he was instigating it?

         14        A.   I wouldn't say he was instigating it

         15    because I couldn't tell, but both tables were

         16    taunting each other.

         17        Q.   Okay.  Then why did you talk to him

         18    first?

         19        A.   Because he was kind of -- he looked a

         20    little bit more intoxicated than other people

         21    that were kind of arguing with each other, so I

         22    felt like he could potentially put himself in a

         23    position to harm.

         24        Q.   Okay.  You say you just told him to



                                                             76

          1    calm down; is that what you said?

          2        A.   Yeah.

          3        Q.   Did you ask him what his problem was,

          4    what the issue was, anything like that?

          5             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   You just told him to calm down?

          8        A.   Right.

          9        Q.   Okay.  So he stood out to you as

         10    someone who needed to calm down?

         11        A.   Yeah, because he was closer to the

         12    tables, and he looked like he was falling over

         13    a little bit.  And then once I saw that he

         14    couldn't really hold himself up, that's when I

         15    made security aware.

         16        Q.   Okay.  You said at this point in time

         17    between this conversation you had with this

         18    gentleman, he fell over?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   What did he fall onto?

         21        A.   He bumped into the girl, and he fell

         22    over.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Was she seated or standing?

         24        A.   She was standing.



                                                             77

          1        Q.   Was she taunting?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   What was her name?

          4        A.   Shaney.

          5        Q.   Can you spell that?

          6        A.   The girl that I mentioned earlier,

          7    S-H-A-N-E-Y, I believe.

          8        Q.   Okay.  Do you know Shaney's last name?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   She's a regular; she comes to your

         11    events?

         12             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         13        A.   No, she's not a regular.

         14        Q.   But she comes to your events?

         15        A.   She has.

         16        Q.   And you've seen her since?

         17        A.   Maybe once.

         18        Q.   And she complained that she got thrown

         19    out?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   Did she say who threw her out?

         22        A.   No, but she said it was security who

         23    had escorted her out.

         24        Q.   Did they escort her out the front or



                                                             78

          1    the back, or do you not know?

          2        A.   I don't know.

          3        Q.   Did you see her being escorted out?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Do you know what time she was escorted

          6    out?

          7        A.   I don't, but I know she was no longer

          8    there.

          9        Q.   At what point?

         10        A.   I don't remember what point, but you

         11    know.

         12        Q.   She was obviously --

         13        A.   She was nowhere to be found, though,

         14    after the fact.

         15        Q.   Were you looking for her?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   There's a lot of people there?

         18        A.   Yeah, there's a lot of people.

         19        Q.   All right.  So you weren't looking for

         20    her, but she wasn't around?

         21        A.   Yeah, I noticed that she was no longer

         22    around.

         23        Q.   Did you notice if she was gone before

         24    George was gone?



                                                             79

          1        A.   I don't know that.

          2        Q.   Okay.  So what event did she go to

          3    next, Shaney?

          4        A.   I believe she attended like an island

          5    Caribbean event that we had at GEM.

          6        Q.   Is that when she had this conversation

          7    with you?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   What did you say to her, if anything?

         10        A.   I don't recall what I said to her.  I

         11    just remember being pretty disappointed that it

         12    happened.

         13        Q.   Did you apologize to her?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   Did you buy her any drinks or try to

         16    make it up in some way?

         17        A.   No, I was disappointed and apologetic

         18    for the most part.

         19        Q.   And what were you disappointed in?

         20        A.   That she had gotten kicked out as

         21    opposed to the gentleman that bumped into her.

         22    If anything, they both should have been kicked

         23    out.

         24        Q.   But you weren't with them the whole



                                                             80

          1    time, correct?

          2        A.   Correct.

          3        Q.   So you don't know if she did something

          4    else, right?

          5        A.   Correct.

          6        Q.   Okay.  So you're kind of guessing that

          7    she didn't do anything; you're making an

          8    assumption; is that fair to say?

          9        A.   I did make an assumption for the most

         10    part, but from what I observed with him kind of

         11    falling and bumping into her, I would say that,

         12    you know, essentially, it's a possibility that

         13    it was his fault.

         14        Q.   Right.  And it also could have been

         15    when you walked away, she did something when

         16    you weren't looking?

         17        A.   Right.

         18        Q.   Okay.  So after you saw this guy and

         19    you saw him stumble over, what else -- while

         20    you were there, what else did you do, if

         21    anything?

         22        A.   I did look up towards Alan and George

         23    and kind of told them to get their friend.  I

         24    didn't really know George that well, but he was



                                                             81

          1    on the higher level up with Alan on the couch

          2    or the table or whatever it was, and I just

          3    told them, hey, you've got to take care of

          4    them.  He's drunk.  I kind of gave them that

          5    look.

          6        Q.   I know the look.

          7        A.   Yeah, you've got to get him home.

          8        Q.   Did you point to him?  Did you gesture

          9    to them?

         10        A.   Yeah, yeah.

         11        Q.   What did they say to you, if anything?

         12        A.   I don't think they really like paid

         13    any mind to it from what I remember, but I

         14    don't remember what was said.

         15        Q.   You don't know -- did they get down

         16    and get him up?

         17        A.   No, he got up on his own.

         18        Q.   So he was able to get himself up?

         19        A.   Yeah.

         20        Q.   And those two gentlemen didn't do

         21    anything?

         22        A.   No, not that I remember.

         23        Q.   Okay.

         24        A.   They could have did something when I



                                                             82

          1    left, but I don't know.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Were they laughing when he

          3    fell?

          4        A.   No.  I think their primary focus was

          5    on the other table as the other table's primary

          6    focus was on them.

          7        Q.   So was George taunting the other table

          8    as well?

          9        A.   From what I remember, no.  He was kind

         10    of just looking on, observing.

         11        Q.   Okay.  You had said that both tables

         12    were taunting each other?

         13        A.   Uh-huh.

         14        Q.   Is that correct?

         15        A.   Correct.

         16        Q.   Okay.  So how many people from

         17    George's table was taunting the people at the

         18    other table?

         19        A.   I don't remember the number.

         20        Q.   It was more than one?

         21        A.   Yeah.

         22        Q.   Okay.  You're sure George didn't do

         23    anything?

         24        A.   I'm positive.



                                                             83

          1        Q.   While you were there?

          2        A.   Yeah, I'm positive.  He was just

          3    standing there, yeah.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So when you went away, did you

          5    go right to security?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   Did you have a radio to be able to

          8    contact them?

          9        A.   No.  So I grabbed the first, you know,

         10    security that I could find and made him aware.

         11        Q.   And who was that?

         12        A.   I don't remember.  It's not one of our

         13    usual guys that I see at our events.

         14        Q.   What did he look like?

         15        A.   He was a Caucasian male.

         16        Q.   Okay.  How tall?

         17        A.   I'd say roughly around my height so

         18    about six-three, six-four.

         19        Q.   Okay.  What was he wearing?

         20        A.   If I'm not mistaken, they had suits on

         21    that night.

         22        Q.   Black suits?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Did he have a radio?



                                                             84

          1        A.   Not that I can remember.

          2        Q.   Okay.  So what did you say to him,

          3    specifically?

          4        A.   I told him that there was a gentleman

          5    at the table that was too drunk.  He fell over

          6    and hit a young lady next to him, and he needed

          7    to be removed.

          8        Q.   When you say "hit," did you say it in

          9    that way that he punched her, struck her, or he

         10    just fell on her?

         11             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         12        A.   Fell.

         13        Q.   What did you say, specifically?

         14        A.   I don't remember what I said,

         15    specifically.

         16        Q.   You just alerted him that he was

         17    drunk, essentially?

         18        A.   Correct.

         19        Q.   In your mind?

         20        A.   Correct.

         21        Q.   And he appeared intoxicated to you

         22    because he was falling; is that fair?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   How about what he was saying?



                                                             85

          1        A.   I don't recall what he was saying.

          2        Q.   Was he saying anything unusual?

          3        A.   Not unusual, no.

          4        Q.   Was he screaming?

          5        A.   No, he wasn't screaming.

          6        Q.   Was he talking to you but you were

          7    having trouble hearing him because of the

          8    music?

          9        A.   Yeah, I couldn't really hear much

         10    because of the music.

         11        Q.   Because it was loud?

         12        A.   Yeah, the music is pretty loud.

         13        Q.   Obviously, our friend Gurdy blew the

         14    speaker.

         15        A.   Yeah.

         16        Q.   Do you remember which speaker he blew?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   Okay.  After you alerted the security

         19    guard to that, do you know if he spoke to

         20    anyone?

         21        A.   Not that I saw, no.

         22        Q.   Do you know if he did?

         23        A.   I don't know for sure.

         24        Q.   Do you know if he radioed anyone?



                                                             86

          1        A.   No, I didn't see him radio anyone.

          2        Q.   Did you stay with him for the rest of

          3    the night?

          4        A.   No, I didn't.

          5        Q.   After you alerted him --

          6        A.   Actually, no, let me take a step back.

          7    I actually walked him to the gentleman, and the

          8    gentleman was with like this big -- this is

          9    when he was away from the table.  I think there

         10    was a space like behind the tables, and I

         11    brought the security guard kind of towards him,

         12    like, hey, that's the guy.  And the gentleman

         13    was, I guess, with this big football

         14    player-looking dude that, I guess, was a friend

         15    of his.  And he was, like, oh, he's good; I got

         16    him.  And the security kind of left it there.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So if I'm hearing you

         18    correctly, correct me if I'm wrong, you brought

         19    the security guard over?

         20        A.   Uh-huh.

         21        Q.   Security guard was there, and he had

         22    this individual that you felt was intoxicated,

         23    George's friend?

         24        A.   Yeah.



                                                             87

          1        Q.   He had another friend?

          2        A.   Uh-huh.

          3        Q.   Is that correct?

          4        A.   Correct.

          5        Q.   And do you know who that person is?

          6        A.   No, that was my first time seeing him

          7    the whole night.

          8        Q.   Have you seen him again?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   Okay.  So he says, I've got him; he's

         11    okay.  I'll take care of him?

         12        A.   Yeah.

         13        Q.   Security guard left at that point, or

         14    did you leave at that point?

         15        A.   I left, and I left it to security to

         16    basically do his job.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So you don't know what else was

         18    said between them after you left?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Did you go back to your table

         21    at that point?

         22        A.   I don't remember, yeah, because

         23    usually I float.

         24        Q.   Did you look over at that table again



                                                             88

          1    after you brought the security guard over?

          2        A.   No, but I remember having a

          3    conversation with Joe about it, about the

          4    situation as we got a little later into the

          5    night.

          6        Q.   Okay.  But you didn't observe the

          7    table again?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Do you know if Red Lantern or

         10    anyone employed at Red Lantern took any steps

         11    to address this individual's issues?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Do you know if the waitresses

         14    cut him off?

         15        A.   No.

         16        Q.   You don't know?

         17        A.   No, I don't know.

         18        Q.   Okay.  But ultimately, is it your

         19    understanding he was taken out the back door?

         20        A.   Yeah, when I spoke to Joe.

         21        Q.   Okay.  So you went and spoke to Joe

         22    after you spoke to the security guard?

         23        A.   Uh-huh.

         24        Q.   Is that correct?



                                                             89

          1        A.   Not directly after but eventually.

          2        Q.   Okay.  How long of a gap in time was

          3    it?

          4        A.   I don't remember.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   It was definitely throughout the night

          7    though.

          8        Q.   Could it have been a couple of

          9    minutes, or was it like an hour?

         10        A.   I wouldn't say an hour, but I would

         11    say anywhere between 30 minutes or so, roughly.

         12        Q.   So you were concerned about this guy,

         13    so you went and told Joe about this as well?

         14        A.   Yeah.

         15        Q.   About a half an hour after you brought

         16    security over to address it?

         17        A.   Roughly, yeah.

         18        Q.   Why were you continued to be concerned

         19    if you hadn't been over there again and hadn't

         20    seen any other problems?

         21        A.   Well, it wasn't just the gentleman

         22    himself that was -- you know, it seemed like

         23    the bulk of the issue, but with the tables

         24    taunting each other and being directly next to



                                                             90

          1    each other and being too late, it kind of

          2    changed that order.  It's common sense that you

          3    wouldn't want those tables leaving together.

          4        Q.   Okay.  So when you went to talk to

          5    Joe, it wasn't necessarily about George's

          6    friend that was intoxicated; it was your

          7    concern about the two tables?

          8        A.   About the two tables.

          9        Q.   Okay.  So you don't know if Red

         10    Lantern addressed this guy's issue of having

         11    too much to drink one way or the other,

         12    correct?

         13        A.   Not that I remember, no.

         14        Q.   You don't know whether he was cut off

         15    or not?

         16        A.   I don't know.

         17        Q.   So they could have very well done so,

         18    correct?

         19        A.   Possibility.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Then you had been concerned

         21    about the issue between the tables glaring at

         22    each other?

         23        A.   Yeah.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Did you tell that to the



                                                             91

          1    initial security guard?

          2        A.   No.  My address to the initial

          3    security guard was the gentleman that seemed

          4    too intoxicated.  My address to Joe was the two

          5    tables.

          6        Q.   So as soon as you brought it to his

          7    attention, that's when they had them separated?

          8        A.   Yes.  That's when he suggested that

          9    he'll split them up, yeah.

         10        Q.   Okay.  Why didn't you tell the

         11    security guard your concerns about them glaring

         12    at each other?

         13        A.   I don't remember.  There was a lot

         14    going on that night because I'm a one-man army

         15    kind of managing an event of about 400 people,

         16    so I handled it as fast as I could because I

         17    had a thousand other things to worry about.

         18        Q.   Okay.  So as far as you know, that's

         19    when they were separated, and George and this

         20    pal of his who had too much to drink were let

         21    out the back?

         22        A.   Correct.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Do you know anything that was

         24    said to George by security?



                                                             92

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Do you know about any conversations

          3    George had with the security?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Do you know about any conversations

          6    security had with George's friend?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   Okay.  How do you know George went out

          9    the back?

         10        A.   I knew he went out the back from my

         11    conversation with Joe.

         12        Q.   Okay.  So there was a lot of people at

         13    Alan's table, correct?

         14        A.   That, I can't really --

         15        Q.   That's subjective.  How many people

         16    were at Alan's table?

         17        A.   I don't remember how many people were

         18    there.

         19        Q.   Was it over five, ten?

         20             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         21        A.   It was in between five to eight maybe.

         22        Q.   Okay.  And how many people were at the

         23    table next to George?

         24        A.   It was about the same amount of



                                                             93

          1    people, yeah.

          2        Q.   Okay.

          3             MS. ALVES:  Can we just take a break

          4    real quick?

          5             MR. MCINNIS:  Sure.

          6                  (Off the record, 10:53 a.m.)

          7                  (Back on the record, 10:59 a.m.)

          8        Q.   Now, you said that Joe O'Connor told

          9    you that George was taken out the back door; is

         10    that correct?

         11        A.   Correct.

         12        Q.   Did he tell you Alan Dorr was taken

         13    out the back door?

         14        A.   He said he brought the table, George's

         15    table.

         16        Q.   So your understanding was everyone

         17    seated at the table was taken out the back?

         18        A.   Correct.

         19        Q.   Okay.  Are you aware if that's what

         20    actually happened?

         21        A.   According to my conversation with Joe,

         22    yes.

         23        Q.   Okay.  What about your conversations

         24    with George Craan, did he tell you whether or



                                                             94

          1    not he was brought out the back?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   In your conversations with George

          4    Craan at any time after this incident, did he

          5    tell you that he was brought out the back door

          6    and was jumped in the back alley?

          7        A.   He said he had to make his way to the

          8    front towards his vehicle, so even though they

          9    had to escort him out the back, he still had to

         10    make his way back around past the front of the

         11    establishment.

         12        Q.   Did he mention getting jumped or

         13    having a fight out in the back alley?

         14        A.   Not in the alley, no.

         15        Q.   Did he tell you where the fight was?

         16        A.   In the front.

         17        Q.   Okay.  He told you that?

         18        A.   Yeah.

         19        Q.   Or that's just what you figured out?

         20        A.   He told me that.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Did he tell you what prompted

         22    the fight?

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   Did you ask?



                                                             95

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Did he ever indicate to you

          3    that he struck first?

          4        A.   No, he did mention that the gentleman

          5    from the opposing table was waiting kind of

          6    like lingering outside the front of the

          7    establishment.

          8        Q.   Okay.  Did he say directly in front,

          9    down the street, on the corner?

         10        A.   He just said out front.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Did you know anyone that was

         12    seated at the table next to George?

         13        A.   So one of them, I believe, is -- the

         14    only person that I can remember off the top of

         15    my mind is my partner's, I guess, like, cousin.

         16        Q.   And what's your partner's cousin's

         17    name?

         18        A.   I don't know his name.  I think he

         19    goes by like Tech or something like that.

         20        Q.   Okay.  That's his nickname?

         21        A.   Yeah, I'm assuming that's his

         22    nickname.

         23        Q.   Do you know if Tech has any criminal

         24    history?



                                                             96

          1        A.   Not that I know of, no.

          2        Q.   Do you know if he has any gang

          3    affiliation?

          4        A.   Not that I know of.

          5        Q.   But you know that he's your partner

          6    Christopher's cousin?

          7        A.   Yes, who was at the neighboring table.

          8        Q.   So Christopher would know who Tech is?

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   He would know his real name, where he

         11    lives and all of that?

         12        A.   Probably, yeah.

         13        Q.   What's Christopher's address, please?

         14        A.   I don't know his new address.  He did

         15    move to Holbrook.

         16        Q.   Give me his old address.

         17        A.   63 Vale Street, Roxbury, Mass.

         18        Q.   And now he moved to Holbrook.  When

         19    did he move to Holbrook?

         20        A.   I don't remember when he officially

         21    moved out there, but I want to say roughly a

         22    year ago.

         23        Q.   Did he buy a house out there?

         24        A.   His parents did.



                                                             97

          1        Q.   So he moved with them?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   In the video you saw today, did you

          4    see Tech fighting in that?

          5        A.   Not from what I could see, no.

          6        Q.   Do you have a memory of that when you

          7    saw it on George's phone a couple years ago?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Is it your understanding Tech

         10    was involved in the exchange between the

         11    tables?

         12        A.   Yeah.  If I'm not mistaken, I believe

         13    Shaney was, like, a female friend of his,

         14    possibly a girlfriend, I don't know.

         15        Q.   Okay.  I think you mentioned the last

         16    time you saw Shaney was around 2018; is that

         17    accurate?

         18        A.   Yeah, I mean, I've seen her like at

         19    very random places that I can't even, like,

         20    recall the dates on, probably out, I'd see her

         21    there.  Yeah, I really can't remember when I

         22    last seen her after that.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Do you have her phone number?

         24        A.   No.



                                                             98

          1        Q.   Do you have Tech's phone number?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Do you know anyone else that

          4    was at that table?

          5        A.   I'm trying to remember.  Other than

          6    Tech, I can't remember anyone else that was at

          7    that table.

          8        Q.   Tech and Shaney?

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   Okay.  And Tech is Christopher's

         11    cousin?

         12        A.   Uh-huh.

         13        Q.   Can I have Christopher's phone number,

         14    please?

         15        A.   Sure.  It's 617-513-8193.

         16        Q.   Okay.  When you realized or saw an

         17    issue going on with the tables and you

         18    recognized Tech at one of those tables, did you

         19    alert Christopher?

         20        A.   I don't remember alerting him, no.

         21        Q.   Did you ask Christopher to go talk to

         22    your cousin?

         23        A.   I don't remember doing that, no.

         24        Q.   Why not?



                                                             99

          1        A.   I mean, it's a possibility that I did

          2    it, but I just don't recall doing it.  I recall

          3    the action that I took outside of that, but I

          4    don't remember if I involved him or not.

          5        Q.   Does Tech come to other events of

          6    yours?

          7        A.   Yeah, once in a blue moon, yeah.  I

          8    would say similar to George, he kind of like

          9    pops up, grabs a drink and, you know.

         10        Q.   So you didn't ban George from any of

         11    your events?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Did you make any representation that

         14    you did to anyone at Red Lantern?

         15        A.   No.

         16        Q.   Okay.  How about at Big Night, did you

         17    make a representation that George was banned?

         18        A.   No.

         19        Q.   And I'm assuming you didn't ban Tech

         20    from your events either?

         21        A.   Correct.

         22        Q.   Okay.  How about anyone at either of

         23    the tables, were any of them banned?

         24        A.   I mean, I didn't know any of the other



                                                            100

          1    gentlemen.  I knew Alan and I know Jeslyn, but

          2    they weren't involved from what I saw.

          3        Q.   So neither of them were banned?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Did you ask either of them what

          6    happened?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   Alan or Jeslyn?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   Does the name Malcolm sound familiar?

         11        A.   No.

         12        Q.   Sam or Samuel, the name of George's

         13    friend who had recently got out of prison?

         14             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         15        A.   No.  I didn't know his name at all.

         16        Q.   Okay.  You didn't ask?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   The table adjacent to George where

         19    Tech was sitting, did you make that

         20    reservation?  Was that a reservation through

         21    you?

         22        A.   Yeah.

         23        Q.   Was it Tech that made the reservation

         24    or Christopher?



                                                            101

          1        A.   I believe it was Tech that made the

          2    reservation.

          3        Q.   Did you document that reservation?

          4        A.   It's documented under Tablelist.  All

          5    the reservations are documented under

          6    Tablelist.

          7        Q.   You have a table list?

          8        A.   Yeah, but I don't have access to the

          9    Red Lantern anymore, but if you get access to

         10    that venue, you can kind of go back and see the

         11    reservation that was documented and the name

         12    under the reservations.

         13        Q.   Would you maintain that document?

         14        A.   No, I wouldn't -- I can no longer

         15    maintain it because I don't have access, but

         16    the management at Red Lantern could maintain

         17    it.

         18        Q.   Okay.  That's what you think; do you

         19    know that for sure?

         20        A.   Yeah, they have access to the system.

         21        Q.   What's the system?

         22        A.   It's a venue management system, so you

         23    could do ticket bookings through there.  You

         24    can do table bookings through there.  You can



                                                            102

          1    do --

          2        Q.   Do you know the name of the system?

          3        A.   It's now referenced as TablelistPro.

          4        Q.   How did you take the reservation for

          5    that table with Tech?

          6        A.   I don't remember.

          7        Q.   Do you remember -- when you saw Tech,

          8    did you know Tech?

          9        A.   Yeah, I knew of him.

         10        Q.   Did you ask him to, you know, cool it

         11    down?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Did you ask Tech what was going

         14    on?

         15        A.   No, I didn't have a discussion with

         16    him.  I kind of just walked over there, just

         17    kind of told both tables to kind of calm down

         18    and then addressed the gentleman that seemed a

         19    little too intoxicated that fell over.

         20             When he fell over, that kind of

         21    distracted me from having a further discussion

         22    with any of the other people at the table.

         23        Q.   When the guy got back on his feet, did

         24    he say anything to you?



                                                            103

          1        A.   Not that I remember, no.

          2        Q.   He didn't yell at you?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   He didn't take a swing at you?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   He didn't take a swing at anyone?

          7        A.   From what I saw, no.

          8        Q.   Did you hear that guy yelling anything

          9    at all?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Okay.  I think you mentioned this, and

         12    correct me if I'm wrong.  When you want to do

         13    an event, you kind of do an email or a text

         14    blast?

         15        A.   Uh-huh.

         16        Q.   Is that correct?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Who do you do that service through?

         19        A.   Mailchimp.

         20        Q.   Mail Champ?

         21        A.   Mailchimp, C-H-I-M-P.

         22        Q.   And that's an online company?

         23        A.   Yeah.  It's basically like an emailing

         24    service.  We do text blasts through EZ Text.



                                                            104

          1        Q.   Okay.  How do you maintain the phone

          2    numbers for your text blasts?  Do you have a

          3    database?

          4        A.   Yes.

          5        Q.   Tell me about your database.

          6        A.   I keep it all on Mailchimp.  I keep a

          7    document of all the emails that we have.  And

          8    then on TablelistPro, we also leverage that

          9    database.  We can go back and get phone

         10    numbers, if needed.

         11        Q.   So you could track down Shaney's

         12    number on that list?

         13        A.   No.

         14        Q.   Why not?

         15        A.   Because she was, it looks like, part

         16    of the table.  She wouldn't have had to book a

         17    ticket to submit her information.  She would

         18    kind of just be a part of the table.

         19        Q.   Do you know if she's on your mailing

         20    list?

         21        A.   Not that I'm aware of, but I could

         22    look for it.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Will you do that for me?

         24        A.   Yeah.  Let me see.



                                                            105

          1        Q.   Can you do that right now?

          2        A.   Yup.

          3        Q.   Great.  While you're at it, could you

          4    check for Tech.

          5        A.   No, I don't have anything for her.

          6        Q.   How about Tech?

          7        A.   No, I don't have anything for Tech for

          8    contacts.

          9        Q.   Do you think you could reach

         10    Christopher now?

         11        A.   It might be rough because he's at

         12    work.  I mean, I could shoot him a text and ask

         13    him if he's available.

         14        Q.   I just want Tech's name and contact

         15    information, so if you could try to reach him,

         16    that would be fine.

         17             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         18        Q.   Let me know when you shoot off the

         19    text.  I'll go back and ask you a few more

         20    questions.

         21        A.   I just shot it over.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.  Earlier you were

         23    talking about the bottle being a champagne

         24    bottle that George was struck with out front;



                                                            106

          1    is that correct?

          2        A.   Uh-huh.

          3        Q.   Yes?

          4        A.   Yes, sorry.

          5        Q.   But you don't know if it was a

          6    champagne bottle or not?

          7        A.   I didn't physically see it, so no.

          8        Q.   Okay.  And you don't know if it came

          9    from the venue or not, correct?

         10        A.   Correct.  It was an assumption that it

         11    came from the venue.

         12        Q.   You're making a speculation; you're

         13    thinking that would make sense?

         14             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         15        A.   Yeah.

         16        Q.   It could have been a bottle from the

         17    park across the street, correct?

         18             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         19        A.   I mean, I don't deem that possible,

         20    but sure, there's a possibility.

         21        Q.   It could have came from out of a

         22    garbage can, correct?

         23             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         24        A.   Possibility.



                                                            107

          1        Q.   You didn't personally see anyone

          2    sneaking a bottle out?

          3             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Okay.  As you were leaving for the

          6    night, you said you got locked in?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Who locked you in?

          9        A.   Security.

         10        Q.   Why?

         11        A.   Because there was a commotion going on

         12    outside.

         13        Q.   So they were trying to protect people

         14    that were in the venue?

         15             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   Or at least that was your

         18    understanding?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   Okay.  How long did you have to wait

         21    before you could go out?

         22        A.   I don't remember how long.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Did you hear police sirens?

         24        A.   Not that I remember, no.



                                                            108

          1        Q.   Did you hear --

          2        A.   I heard the ambulance siren for sure.

          3        Q.   When you got out, you said you saw an

          4    ambulance?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   Was there police?

          7        A.   I don't remember seeing the police.

          8        Q.   Okay.  Did you speak to the police?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   When you were locked in, were you

         11    locked in with anyone you recognized?

         12        A.   No, not that I remember.

         13        Q.   Were you with Christopher?

         14        A.   No, I was actually with my current

         15    wife, actually.

         16        Q.   Oh, okay.  What's her name?

         17        A.   Nicole West.

         18        Q.   Did she witness any of this evening

         19    that we've just talked about?

         20        A.   She's actually the one who saw the

         21    kind of like commotion and tapped me on the

         22    shoulder and made me aware.

         23        Q.   So it wasn't you being astute; it was

         24    your wife?



                                                            109

          1        A.   Yeah.

          2        Q.   So she spotted it and brought it to

          3    your attention?

          4        A.   Yeah.

          5        Q.   Did she know anyone at any of those

          6    tables?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   Are you sure?

          9        A.   Positive.

         10        Q.   Did you give your home address

         11    earlier?

         12        A.   Yes.

         13        Q.   Can you give it to me one more time?

         14        A.   Sure, it's 146 North Beacon Street,

         15    Brighton, Massachusetts.

         16        Q.   And how long have you lived there?

         17        A.   About a year and two months.

         18        Q.   Do you own that house?

         19        A.   No, it's rented.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Do you just live there with

         21    your wife?  Do you have any kids?

         22        A.   No kids.  Well, not here.  I have a

         23    daughter that lives in DC with her mom.

         24        Q.   Are you from DC?



                                                            110

          1        A.   No, from New York.

          2        Q.   From what part?

          3        A.   Bronx, New York.

          4        Q.   Queens.

          5        A.   I was born in Queens.

          6        Q.   I'm assuming you came to this area for

          7    school and stayed; is that fair to say?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Did Red Lantern have a valet

         10    service on the night of your event?

         11        A.   Not that I can remember, no.

         12        Q.   Generally, it was everybody just park

         13    wherever you can find parking or in the garage

         14    next door?

         15             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         16        A.   Yeah, in the garage next door.

         17        Q.   So as far as you know, there was no

         18    valet service?

         19        A.   No.  From what I saw, no one was

         20    actually allowed to park on the street of Red

         21    Lantern.

         22        Q.   So there was no cars on the street?

         23        A.   No, not that I remember.

         24        Q.   Now, I know you mentioned you got a



                                                            111

          1    piece of the bar?

          2        A.   Yeah.

          3        Q.   And you mentioned that you got the

          4    door?

          5        A.   Uh-huh.  Correct.

          6        Q.   If there was a valet, would you get a

          7    piece of the valet?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Did you ever have a valet at GEM?

         10        A.   At GEM, no, but there was, I guess, a

         11    garage across the street that was considered

         12    valet but not officially GEM's valet.

         13        Q.   So it was some garage that basically

         14    ran a valet service?

         15        A.   Correct.

         16        Q.   So it was like an independent?

         17        A.   Right.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Aside from doing promotions, do

         19    you have any other type of job?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   What else do you do?

         22        A.   Currently, I'm a sales director for a

         23    company called Aborn & Co.

         24        Q.   I'm sorry?

          1        A.   Called Aborn, A-B-O-R-N, & Co.

          2        Q.   What do they do?

          3        A.   They basically assist anybody that

          4    supplies or ships equipment with getting a

          5    visual on their supply chain and with freight

          6    management.

          7        Q.   So it's a shipping company?

          8        A.   Correct.

          9        Q.   Okay.  What type of business do you

         10    do?  Importing?  Exporting?

         11        A.   Yeah, so we talk to companies that

         12    import and export, and our job is to basically

         13    help them negotiate better rates with carriers,

         14    help them do a better job of collecting their

         15    data that they use with carriers and also with

         16    having a visual on their supply chain from when

         17    the truckers pick up the equipment to when

         18    they're on the road to when they drop it off,

         19    and we have a third-party technology company

         20    that we use to assist them with that.

         21        Q.   Did you document how much you made at

         22    the door on May 27, 2017?

         23        A.   No, I did not.

         24        Q.   Do you know exactly how many people



                                                            113

          1    were there?

          2        A.   Not exactly.  I would say definitely

          3    upward of 400.

          4        Q.   Okay.  But you don't have any

          5    documentation to support that?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Okay.  And that is 400 people that

          8    came to the event?

          9        A.   Correct.

         10        Q.   So at any given time, people could

         11    leave; is that correct?

         12        A.   Correct.

         13        Q.   Do you know how many people were

         14    leaving or when they started to leave?

         15        A.   No, I don't typically pay attention to

         16    that.

         17        Q.   Right, they're gone.  They're not

         18    buying anything?

         19        A.   Yeah, I made my money already.  That's

         20    it.

         21        Q.   When you told the security guard about

         22    the individual, did you tell him that you

         23    wanted him cut off from drinking?

         24        A.   I told him I wanted him escorted out,



                                                            114

          1    yeah.

          2        Q.   Did you tell the waitress servicing

          3    the table to cut him off?

          4        A.   She wasn't around.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Did you look for her?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Do you know her?

          8        A.   I do not.

          9        Q.   Do you know if George's friend was

         10    drinking before he got there?

         11        A.   No, not aware of that.

         12        Q.   Do you know if George's friend was

         13    using any type of narcotics?

         14        A.   No, not that I know of.

         15        Q.   Illegal drugs?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   Or prescription drugs for that matter?

         18        A.   No.

         19        Q.   You don't know?

         20        A.   No.

         21        Q.   So BENT Entertainment, I think you

         22    said, is Ballot?

         23        A.   Ballot.

         24        Q.   Can you spell that for me?

          4        Q.   And what's the significance of that

          5    name?

          6        A.   It's supposed to be like nerd in

          7    French or something like that.  We kind of took

          8    it and gave it a spin.

          9        Q.   So is it a corporation?

         10        A.   Partnership.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And is it Ballot, PC?

         12        A.   No, it's just Ballot Entertainment.

         13        Q.   Did you register with the state?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And what is it registered as?

         16        A.   It's registered as a partnership.

         19        Q.   So if I was to look it up, it would be

         22        Q.   Okay.  And do you maintain any type of

                                                            116

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Are you now friends with George Craan?

          5    Would you describe that as your relationship?

          6        A.   I'd say we're associates.

          7        Q.   Associates?  Do you do business

          8    together?

          9        A.   No, not like business associates, but

         10    kind of like casual associates.  You see a

         11    familiar face, you say hi.

         12        Q.   Like acquaintances?

         13        A.   Yeah, there you go.

         14        Q.   Do you know what type of business

         15    George is in?

         22        Q.   Up until 2018?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   And I'm wondering did you stop working



                                                            117

          1    with GEM because they closed or for some other

          2    reason?

          3        A.   I stopped working with them not

          4    because they closed.  I would say we wanted to

          5    take our business elsewhere and then

          6    eventually --

          7        Q.   Were you unhappy there?

          8             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

          9        A.   Yeah, I wasn't too happy with the

         10    money; however, I still maintained my

         11    relationships there through Joe.

         12        Q.   Where is Joe now?

         13        A.   When I last spoke to him, he was at

         14    Shrine in Foxwoods, but I believe he moved from

         15    there and is elsewhere but is still working for

         16    Big Night.

         17        Q.   When was the last time you talked to

         18    him?

         19        A.   I don't know.  It's been a while.

         20        Q.   Do you have his phone number?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   May I have it?

         23        A.   Sure.  I have two phone numbers on

         24    file.  I have 516-680-8526, and I have



                                                            118

          1    516-662-4672.

          2        Q.   We have another New Yorker on our

          3    hands.

          4        A.   Uh-huh.  He's from Connecticut though.

          5        Q.   That doesn't count.  I always say that

          6    Connecticut is that thing you drive through

          7    between Boston and New York.  No offense to

          8    anyone.

          9             So you haven't spoken to him in a

         10    while.  Aside from GEM and Red Lantern, have

         11    you at any point this year requested to do

         12    business with Big Night?

         13        A.   I can actually tell you that now.  One

         14    second.  Let me check my email.  2019 -- the

         15    last time I requested business from Big Night

         16    was December of last year.

         17        Q.   So 2018?

         18        A.   Correct.

         19        Q.   December 2018?

         20        A.   Uh-huh.

         21        Q.   And when did you want to do an event

         22    with them?

         23        A.   You said when?

         24        Q.   Yes.  I'm assuming you pitched some



                                                            119

          1    sort of idea to them?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   What was the idea?

          4        A.   The idea was to do an after party at

          5    The Grand for a popular artist with an art

          6    demographic.

          7        Q.   What artist?

          8        A.   Meek Mill.

          9        Q.   Oh, yeah, he's great.

         10        A.   He had a concert in Lowell on March

         11    20.  We were hoping to do an after party there.

         12        Q.   So what happened?  Did you do it?

         13        A.   No.

         14        Q.   Did they respond?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   What did they say?

         17        A.   They said sorry, this isn't something

         18    we would collaborate on.

         19        Q.   Anything else?

         20        A.   No, just left it at that.

         21        Q.   And before that, when was the last

         22    time?

         23        A.   Before that was November 14, 2018.

         24        Q.   Okay.  So a month earlier?



                                                            120

          1        A.   Right.

          2        Q.   Also The Grand or a different one of

          3    their venues?

          4        A.   If I'm not mistaken, give me one

          5    second, I'm going through it.  Actually, I sent

          6    the original inquiry September 6, 2018, excuse

          7    me.

          8        Q.   The one for the after party?

          9        A.   No, this one was for a Halloween party

         10    at Red Lantern.

         11        Q.   And what was their response?

         12        A.   He said, we'll all discuss ASAP and

         13    get back to you.

         14        Q.   And did they get back to you?

         15        A.   From what I'm seeing on this email

         16    thread, no.

         17        Q.   Okay.  Prior to that?

         18        A.   Well, that was like the last one.

         19    After that was October 1, 2018, and that was --

         20    I was proposing an R&B party at Red Lantern for

         21    Valentine's Day.

         22        Q.   And what was their response to that?

         23        A.   He said, let me chat about it with the

         24    team and get back to you.



                                                            121

          1        Q.   Okay.  And did they ever get back to

          2    you?

          3        A.   I'm looking now.  No.

          4        Q.   Before or after?

         16        A.   He's a rapper.

         17        Q.   Okay.

         18        A.   Excuse me, on 11/14/2018, Randy did

         19    actually send me a note back about Valentine's

         20    Day.  He said, "Sent to the Red Lantern team,

         21    and I don't believe this is a fit for Red

         22    Lantern.  Sorry."

         23        Q.   Okay.  Did you maintain -- I ask you

         24    to maintain all of these -- are these email



                                                            122

          1    exchanges that you're reading from?

          2        A.   You said did someone ask me?

          3        Q.   No, I just want to clarify for the

          4    record that you're reading from emails?

          5        A.   Yes, I'm tracking emails right now.

          6        Q.   What I'm asking you to do is to please

          7    save these emails, and please forward these

          8    emails.

          9        A.   Okay.

         10        Q.   You have my card.  Please forward them

         11    to my email.  I'm sure Mr. Craan's counsel

         12    would like you to send those as well.

         13             MS. ALVES:  Yes.

         14        Q.   If you could do that.

         15        A.   Okay.

         16        Q.   So before you start sending them, can

         17    you tell me any other events that you pitched

         18    that were turned down?

         19        A.   Other than that, that was it.

         20        Q.   Was the Valentine's event, was that

         21    supposed to be at Red Lantern?

         22        A.   Say it again.

         23        Q.   You requested a Valentine's Day event?

         24        A.   At Red Lantern, yes.



                                                            123

          1        Q.   And a Halloween party?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Why did you want to do them at Red

          4    Lantern?

          5        A.   For two reasons:  A, I wanted to

          6    revisit that business opportunity and make up

          7    for the mishap that happened, basically, for

          8    the sake of my brand because we don't have

          9    incidents like that; and then two, I know

         10    financially it would have been a good

         11    opportunity for my company.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Did you end up having those

         13    events somewhere else?

         14        A.   I believe so, not the after party with

         15    Meek Mill, but I believe the Halloween party we

         16    had elsewhere.  If I'm not mistaken, I believe

         17    we did the after party at GEM instead of Red

         18    Lantern.  I mean the Halloween party at GEM

         19    instead of Red Lantern.

         20        Q.   Why would you rather it at Red

         21    Lantern, because it's bigger?

         22        A.   Yeah.  The Halloween is one of the

         23    biggest holidays.

         24        Q.   More people, more money?



                                                            124

          1        A.   Correct.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Who is your contact now

          3    currently with the Red Lantern?

          4        A.   Nobody at Red Lantern.

          5        Q.   Or just any of the Big Night?

          6        A.   My previous contact was through Randy.

          7        Q.   Randy?

          8        A.   Uh-huh.

          9        Q.   What's Randy's last name?

         10        A.   Randy Greenstein, G-R-E-E-N-S-T-E-I-N.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And is he an employee of Big

         12    Night or something?

         13        A.   To my understanding, he's the owner.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And you contacted him directly?

         15        A.   Correct.

         16        Q.   Okay.

         17        A.   With Joe cc'd because Joe recommended

         18    that I reach out to him.

         19        Q.   Okay.  And when you cc'd Joe, does he

         20    have a BNEG email or a different email?

         21        A.   Yes, it's the BNEG email.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Since Halloween of 2018, you

         23    haven't been able to get anything off the

         24    ground with Big Night Entertainment?



                                                            125

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Okay.  In addition to those exchanges

          3    that we were just talking about, you had also

          4    mentioned some videos?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   Do you have those videos?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Can you email those videos to us as

          9    well?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   Thank you.  The packages that you were

         12    talking about a little while earlier, how do

         13    you inform your customers that that's

         14    available?

         15        A.   We generally market it via either

         16    email or social media.

         17        Q.   Okay.  So it's something you would

         18    alert them to in advance?

         19        A.   Correct.

         20        Q.   Do you know what your package deal was

         21    that particular night?  Do you have that old

         22    email?

         23        A.   I don't remember.  I could try and

         24    research it, but I don't remember it off the



                                                            126

          1    top of my head.

          2        Q.   That's okay.  If you come across it,

          3    please send that along as well.

          4             When somebody is going to buy a

          5    package, how is that done?

          6        A.   When they're going to purchase a

          7    package, they typically communicate that

          8    through -- they'll either communicate that

          9    directly through the bottle service girl who

         10    should be aware of the package, or it would be

         11    myself or my partner who would communicate to

         12    the bottle girl what package they're doing.

         13             And then, I guess, lastly, it would be

         14    the general manager who also has access to the

         15    system, you know, that would make the bottle

         16    girl aware as well.

         17        Q.   Do you know if Alan's table had a

         18    package or not?

         19        A.   I don't remember.

         20        Q.   How about the table with Tech?

         21        A.   I don't remember that either, no.

         22        Q.   Okay.  You like Red Lantern; fair to

         23    say?

         24        A.   Yes.



                                                            127

          1        Q.   You want to go back there?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   Generally speaking, you think it's a

          4    safe place?

          5        A.   Yes.

          6        Q.   Good business?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Have you heard back from Christopher?

          9        A.   No.

         10             MR. MCINNIS:  I think I covered all

         11    the questions I want to ask.

         12             MS. ALVES:  Okay.  I just want to

         13    follow up on a couple of things.

         14             THE WITNESS:  Can I take a break now?

         15             MS. ALVES:  Sure.

         20    BY MR. MCINNIS:

         21        Q.   In regard to paying DJ Gurdy, you had

         22    mentioned under normal circumstances you tried

         23    to pay someone by the DJ booth?

         24        A.   Correct.



                                                            128

          1        Q.   Okay.  Do you have a memory of doing

          2    that with him on the night in question?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Okay.  Do you ever pay people on the

          5    street?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   Would you do that?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Why would you not?

         10        A.   I wouldn't want anyone to see me

         11    handing funds to someone who worked an event

         12    because that could possibly put them at risk.

         13        Q.   And you could also potentially get

         14    robbed, I guess?

         15             MS. ALVES:  Objection.

         16        A.   Right.

         17        Q.   Would you do it in the doorway?

         18        A.   In the doorway, no.  I would try to do

         19    it as discreetly as possible which is why I

         20    generally shoot to do it in the DJ booth area.

         21        Q.   So would there be any circumstances

         22    you would have paid in, say, the threshold when

         23    people were exiting?

         24        A.   I mean, it's a possibility.  Like, for



                                                            129

          1    example, if I don't remember necessarily how I

          2    paid him.  For example, if I went to the DJ

          3    booth and didn't see him there, but I just so

          4    happened to see him exiting and I had the money

          5    on me, maybe I would give him five and give him

          6    his cash discreetly, but other than that, I

          7    would definitely aim to give it to him in the

          8    area of work.

          9        Q.   Did you tell him that you were unhappy

         10    with his performance when you paid him?

         11        A.   No.

         12        Q.   Just let it go?

         13        A.   Yeah.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Did you pay DJ Gurdy in front

         15    of the venue?

         16        A.   No.

         17             MR. MCINNIS:  Okay.  I have no other

         18    questions.

         20                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED

         21    BY MS. ALVES:

         22        Q.   So since we're on that topic, you said

         23    that you didn't pay DJ Gurdy in front of the

         24    venue, correct?



                                                            130

          1        A.   Correct.

          2        Q.   Okay.  You didn't pay him on the

          3    street in front of the venue, correct?

          4        A.   Correct.

          5        Q.   But you do not remember where you paid

          6    him, correct?

          7        A.   Correct.

          8        Q.   And you're not certain you paid him at

          9    the DJ booth?

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Now, you testified that you

         12    spoke with me about this case; is that correct?

         13        A.   Correct.

         14        Q.   Are you sure that it was me and not my

         15    partner, Sania Santos?

         16             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         17        A.   Sania Santos, the name sounds very

         18    familiar.  It actually was Sania Santos.  I

         19    have her text right here.

         20        Q.   Okay.  So you spoke with Sania Santos,

         21    correct?

         22        A.   Correct.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And do you remember telling

         24    Sania that you saw alcohol being delivered to



                                                            131

          1    George's table?

          2             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          3        A.   I don't remember that.

          4        Q.   Do you remember telling Sania that you

          5    witnessed or observed alcohol being delivered

          6    to the other table?

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        A.   No, I don't recall.

          9        Q.   You don't recall telling Sania that

         10    you saw a gentleman from the other table

         11    holding a Belaire bottle in his hand?

         12             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         13        A.   I told her that that may have been a

         14    possibility, but I honestly don't remember it

         15    enough to really recall, so that's why I would

         16    prefer to withdraw that statement because I'm

         17    not too sure about it.  I'm not 100 percent

         18    sure about it.

         19        Q.   Do you remember seeing a gentleman

         20    from that table holding any bottle in his hand?

         21             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         22        A.   Not that I remember.

         23        Q.   Okay.  When is the last time you spoke

         24    with Joe or had any contact with Joe O'Connor?



                                                            132

          1        A.   Joe, let's see here -- so the last

          2    time we had a text conversation was May 17,

          3    2018.

          4        Q.   Okay.  And would you characterize your

          5    relationship with Joe as a good relationship?

          6        A.   Absolutely.

          7        Q.   Okay.  But do you currently maintain

          8    that relationship?  Do you still have a

          9    relationship with Joe?

         10        A.   I would say that we still have a good

         11    relationship.  We departed our businesses on

         12    good terms, never had any issues outside of the

         13    Red Lantern issue.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And did you not tell Sania that

         15    you spoke with Joe O'Connor after the incident?

         16             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Did you speak with Joe O'Connor after

         19    the incident?

         20        A.   Yeah, I did.  I mentioned that earlier

         21    as well.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Do you remember telling Sania

         23    that Joe indicated the individuals that were

         24    involved in the altercation came from inside of



                                                            133

          1    the venue?

          2             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   You remember that statement that you

          5    made to Sania?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   Okay.  So it's your memory that Joe

          8    O'Connor told you the individuals involved in

          9    the physical altercation outside of Red Lantern

         10    were patrons of Red Lantern?

         11             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         12        A.   Correct.

         13        Q.   And would that include the individuals

         14    that assaulted George?

         15             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   And when did you have this

         18    conversation with Joe?

         19        A.   I believe it was the week after the

         20    event had occurred.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Now, you said that during the

         22    night when you spoke to Joe, you alerted him

         23    that there was an issue between the two tables,

         24    correct?



                                                            134

          1        A.   Correct.

          2        Q.   Okay.  And was it your suggestion or

          3    his suggestion to have them part or exit

          4    separately?

          5             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          6        A.   His suggestion.

          7        Q.   Okay.  And when you say that you were

          8    alerted by Joe that George left out the back

          9    exit, was that after the incident?

         10             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         11        A.   Yes.

         12        Q.   So after the incident, you had a

         13    conversation with Joe, and he told you George's

         14    table was exited out the back?

         15        A.   Correct.

         16        Q.   Did he tell you who escorted George's

         17    table out the back exit?

         18        A.   He did not.

         19        Q.   Did he tell you whether George's table

         20    was just let out the back door, or were they

         21    escorted outside by security?

         22        A.   I don't recall him being specific in

         23    that regard.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Now, you said that the peak of



                                                            135

          1    the night is when you basically hit capacity;

          2    is that correct?

          3        A.   Right.

          4        Q.   What was the capacity of that venue?

          5             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          6        A.   I don't remember the exact number, but

          7    it was upwards of 400.

          8        Q.   Was that the amount of people that you

          9    believe attended the event?

         10             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         11        A.   Correct.

         12        Q.   Do you know what the maximum capacity

         13    is for the venue?

         14        A.   No, not off the top of my head.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So you never discussed that

         16    prior with your contact at Red Lantern what the

         17    max capacity was at that venue?

         18        A.   Not that I remember.

         19        Q.   Would that be something you would talk

         20    to someone at the venue about?

         21        A.   Typically.

         22        Q.   So would you want to know whether the

         23    venue is allowed to have as many people as you

         24    anticipate coming?



                                                            136

          1             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   So you don't remember that

          4    conversation, but you know it probably took

          5    place; is that a correct statement?

          6        A.   Yeah.

          7        Q.   And so did you have a conversation

          8    with anyone at Red Lantern prior to the event

          9    as to how many people you guys were expecting

         10    to attend?

         11             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         12        A.   I believe the conversation happened

         13    with Joe when we had the discussion about

         14    booking Red Lantern in the first place.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And how many people did you

         16    tell Joe approximately you expected?

         17        A.   I told him that we had, roughly,

         18    already 150 to 200 advanced tickets sold.

         19    Typically, when we see advanced tickets of that

         20    kind come in, generally speaking, those numbers

         21    double because those aren't counting the

         22    walk-ups that want to come due to word of

         23    mouth.

         24        Q.   Now, did you have that conversation



                                                            137

          1    with Joe about it potentially doubling at the

          2    actual event?

          3             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          4        A.   I don't recall, but it's a high

          5    possibility.

          6        Q.   Did anyone at Red Lantern talk to you

          7    prior to the event about the number of security

          8    personnel that was going to be at that event?

          9        A.   No.

         10        Q.   So you didn't know how many security

         11    personnel the venue was providing that night?

         12        A.   No.

         13        Q.   Okay.  And based on your experience

         14    and your observation that night, was there

         15    enough security for the amount of people that

         16    you had?

         17             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         18        A.   Based on my observation, I honestly

         19    don't know.  A part of me wants to say for the

         20    most part it was kind of nonexistent because

         21    you couldn't really find them in the crowd, but

         22    the other half of me is I can't really recall

         23    that because that's a call on behalf of the

         24    venue.



                                                            138

          1        Q.   So the venue is responsible of

          2    staffing the security personnel, if they have

          3    security personnel, right?

          4             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          5        A.   Yeah.

          6        Q.   But your observation was you couldn't

          7    really -- there wasn't a known presence of the

          8    security on that day; is that your observation?

          9             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And when you saw or your wife

         12    alerted you of the commotion at George's table

         13    and the neighboring table, you didn't see

         14    security around addressing that issue before

         15    you got there?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   Okay.  And you had to go and find

         18    security --

         19        A.   Correct.

         20        Q.   -- to tell them about this commotion?

         21        A.   Correct.

         22        Q.   Okay.  But your wife was able to see

         23    it from your table?

         24        A.   Correct.



                                                            139

          1        Q.   Now, you stated that when you

          2    approached the tables, Mr. Craan's friend was a

          3    little more intoxicated than everyone else; is

          4    that correct?

          5             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          6        A.   Correct.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Did you have an opportunity to

          8    have any conversations with any members of the

          9    other table?

         10             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         11        A.   The other table, not that I recall.

         12        Q.   So you didn't say anything to the

         13    other table when you walked up to the tables?

         14        A.   As opposed to me generally speaking

         15    just telling everyone to calm down, I didn't

         16    address anyone, specifically.

         17        Q.   Okay.  Did you notice anyone at that

         18    other table or observe anyone as being

         19    intoxicated?

         20             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         21        A.   From what I saw, no.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Did you see anyone at that

         23    table with alcoholic beverages in their hand?

         24             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.



                                                            140

          1        A.   Not that I remember.

          2        Q.   Okay.  Other than this individual at

          3    Mr. Craan's table, did you notice anyone at

          4    Mr. Craan's table that would have been

          5    observably intoxicated?

          6        A.   No.  It mainly seemed like that one

          7    individual.

          8        Q.   Okay.  Did George seem intoxicated to

          9    you?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Okay.  You said George has attended

         12    some of your other events; is that correct?

         13        A.   Correct.

         14        Q.   Have you ever had any issues with

         15    George being at any of your parties or events?

         16        A.   Never.

         17        Q.   Did you have any issue with George on

         18    this day?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   Did you have any conversations with

         21    any employee at Red Lantern in which they felt

         22    like Mr. Craan was the problem that night?

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   And then on this exhibit here, Exhibit



                                                            141

          1    No. 3, okay, you marked where your table was

          2    with a star?

          3        A.   Uh-huh.

          4        Q.   You have George's table labeled, and

          5    you have the other table that he had an

          6    altercation with labeled?

          7        A.   Uh-huh.

          8        Q.   So if you're standing at George's

          9    table facing the dance floor, that other table

         10    would have been to the right?

         11             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

         12        A.   Correct.

         13        Q.   Okay.  Now, was there a table to

         14    George's left if you were standing in the

         15    section looking at the --

         16        A.   Yeah, about one or two tables.

         17        Q.   Can you draw any other tables?

         18        A.   (Witness complies.)

         19        Q.   Okay.  So there were approximately two

         20    tables in between your table and George's

         21    table; is that correct?

         22        A.   Correct.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And approximately, including

         24    George's table, three tables in between your



                                                            142

          1    table and the other table that had the

          2    altercation inside?

          3             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          4        A.   Correct.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Now, is it fair to say that you

          6    last really had contact with Joe O'Connor when

          7    you stopped doing events at GEM Lounge?

          8        A.   That's correct.

          9        Q.   And then after that, you made a few

         10    inquiries to do other events with Big Night,

         11    correct?

         12        A.   Correct.

         13        Q.   And did you reach out to Joe first to

         14    try to facilitate that through Joe?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   And what was Joe's response?

         17        A.   He forwarded me along to Randy because

         18    he had relocated to Shrine out in Connecticut

         19    because that was closer to home for him.

         20        Q.   Okay.  And you testified as to the

         21    inquiries that you made to do events at Red

         22    Lantern, correct --

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   -- after this incident.



                                                            143

          1        A.   A few at Red Lantern, and one was The

          2    Grand.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And Big Night declined to do

          4    any more collaborations, correct?

          5        A.   They didn't say they declined to do

          6    any more collaborations officially, but they

          7    went about it as the event just not being a fit

          8    for the establishments.

          9        Q.   Okay.  And since then, you've been

         10    still promoting, correct?

         11        A.   Correct.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Do you know of any events --

         13    any other events that Red Lantern has at their

         14    establishment?

         15        A.   I saw -- a while ago I saw a promoter

         16    start a Friday night there, like a weekly

         17    Friday.  They also do some, I guess, internal

         18    like promotions because I see their

         19    establishment posted on the Tablelist

         20    application which kind of -- you could purchase

         21    tickets.  You could purchase tables for the

         22    nightlife.

         23        Q.   Okay.  Do you know who this promoter

         24    was that was doing the weekly Fridays?



                                                            144

          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Do you know what type of events these

          3    were or what audience they catered to?

          4        A.   I would say more so -- geared more so

          5    towards Caucasian EDM top 40 crowd.

          6        Q.   Similar to like Shrine's crowd?

          7             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          8        Q.   Are you familiar with Shrine's crowd?

          9        A.   I'm not too familiar with Shrine's

         10    crowd.  I've only been to Shrine once.

         11        Q.   Prior to you doing an event at --

         12    well, let me double back.

         13             What would you say the majority of

         14    your demographic was for that May 26, 2017

         15    party?

         16        A.   African-American either students that

         17    had freshly graduated college or just young

         18    professionals who wanted to come out that

         19    ranged from, say, anywhere between, like, 21 to

         20    30.

         21        Q.   And are you aware of any event prior

         22    to yours at Red Lantern that targeted this

         23    demographic?

         24        A.   No.  From my understanding, our event



                                                            145

          1    was the first of its kind ever done at Red

          2    Lantern.

          3        Q.   And do you know if Red Lantern ever

          4    held any event similar after that?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   Okay.  Prior to you throwing this

          7    event in May of 2017, were you aware of any

          8    event that Red Lantern had at their

          9    establishment where they offered bottle

         10    service?

         11        A.   No, not that I recall.

         12        Q.   Did you have any conversation with

         13    anyone at Red Lantern prior to you throwing the

         14    event about how bottle service would be run

         15    that night?

         16        A.   Joe.

         17        Q.   And what was your conversation with

         18    Joe about how bottle service would be run that

         19    night?

         20        A.   Not more so on the bottle service, but

         21    more so on the organization of the tables and

         22    the setup.  I believe we did roughly 12 tables

         23    that night, 12 tables that we served.

         24        Q.   Okay.  And there would have been a



                                                            146

          1    bottle minimum, right?

          2             MR. MCINNIS:  Objection.

          3        A.   Yeah, minimum spend.

          4        Q.   When you say "minimum spend," what

          5    does that include?

          6        A.   You basically could buy whatever you

          7    want as long as you hit the minimum spend for

          8    that table.

          9        Q.   So it didn't necessarily have to be

         10    bottles?

         11        A.   Yeah, it did have to be bottles.

         12        Q.   So you couldn't be at the table and

         13    also order drinks from the bar?

         14        A.   No.  If you wanted to do that, you

         15    just go to the bar.  We wouldn't necessarily

         16    book someone for that purpose.

         17        Q.   Any food being served?

         18        A.   No.  The kitchen was closed.

         19        Q.   Okay.  And were all 12 tables booked

         20    that night?

         21        A.   Yes, we were sold out.

         22        Q.   Okay.  And could you go to the venue

         23    and book a table that night, or did it have to

         24    be in advance?



                                                            147

          1        A.   Booking a table that night was a

          2    possibility, but I mean, you couldn't because

          3    they sold out in advance.

          4        Q.   So prior to the event, the tables were

          5    already sold out?

          6        A.   Correct.

          7        Q.   Do you remember when the lights came

          8    on that night?

          9        A.   I don't remember when, no.

         10        Q.   Do you recall observing if there were

         11    any security personnel at the door while people

         12    were exiting?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   How many do you recall?

         15        A.   I just remember a couple mainly

         16    because I think the majority of security was

         17    supposed to be outside trying to clear the

         18    street, but I remember one individual actually

         19    closing the door on us, kind of shutting the

         20    door down to protect the people inside once the

         21    incident started happening.

         22        Q.   Okay.

         23             MS. ALVES:  I think that's it.  That's

         24    all I've got.

          2                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED

          3    BY MR. MCINNIS:

          4        Q.   You had mentioned that the demographic

          5    that night was African-American young

          6    professionals 21 to 30?

          7        A.   Correct.

          8        Q.   Is that generally the demographic you

          9    shoot for?

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   You don't shoot for Caucasian or Asian

         12    events or anything like that?

         13        A.   No, but they do attend.  The ones that

         14    love hip-hop, they come out and party with us.

         15        Q.   That's usually the music that you play

         16    at your events?

         17        A.   Yeah, hip-hop, top 40, R&B.

         18        Q.   Do you have any say in what the DJs

         19    play, or are they kind of artists and you leave

         20    them alone?

         21        A.   Yeah, I just leave them alone.

         22        Q.   Okay.  This demographic you said you

         23    would have, that was the same demographic that

         24    was at your GEM events?



                                                            149

          1        A.   Yes.

          2        Q.   Did you have any issues with fights at

          3    your GEM events?

          4        A.   Never.

          5        Q.   Did you recognize any of the security

          6    at Red Lantern from the security from GEM?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Do you remember any of their names?

          9        A.   No, I just remember faces.

         10        Q.   Okay.  And I think you said earlier

         11    that you had seen security spaced out all over

         12    the place?

         13        A.   Yeah.

         14        Q.   Okay.  And they were all wearing black

         15    suits?

         16        A.   From what I remember.

         17        Q.   I mean, dark?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Lights were low?

         20        A.   Yeah.

         21        Q.   It was hard to see people?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23             MR. MCINNIS:  That's all I have.

         24    Thank you.

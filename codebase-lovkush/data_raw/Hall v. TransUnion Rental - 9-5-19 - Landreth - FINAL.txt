 1            WHEREUPON, the following proceedings were
 2   taken pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
 3            THE COURT REPORTER:  Will you give me your
 4   order for the transcript?
 5            MR. HASHMALL:  Yeah.  I think my firm has a
 6   standard order.  Lexitas should have it.
 7            THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.
 8            MR. HARTMANN:  We'll do a copy e-trans with
 9   PDF exhibits.
10                         CORY LANDRETH,
11   having been first duly sworn to state the whole truth,
12   testified as follows:
13                           EXAMINATION
14   BY MR. HASHMALL:
15        Q.   Good morning Mr. Landreth.
16        A.   Good morning.
17        Q.   My name is Joe Hashmall.  I represent the
18   plaintiff in this matter.  And I'd like to start just
19   by talking a little bit about -- kind of the ground
20   rules of this deposition, and -- and then we can get
21   into some of the -- the substance.
22             Have you ever had your deposition taken
23   before?
24        A.   No.
25        Q.   Okay.  So a few basic things.  Of course, you
0006
 1   know there is a court reporter here.  So -- and she's
 2   taking everything down in the form of a transcript.  So
 3   it's important to give verbal answers to questions
 4   that can be taken down in a transcript.  You know, a
 5   nod doesn't really -- doesn't really show up on the
 6   transcripts.
 7             And it's also important that we all try not
 8   to talk over each other so we can get an accurate
 9   record.  So I will certainly try and let you finish
10   your answers; if you will try and let me finish my
11   questions.
12             Does that sound okay?
13        A.   Yep.
14        Q.   Great.  And is there any reason that you
15   can't give full and complete and truthful testimony
16   today?
17        A.   Not that I'm aware of.
18        Q.   Okay.  You should have in front of you a
19   tablet -- you don't need to look at it right now --
20   that we're going to use to display exhibits for you.
21             Do you see that?  I can't see exactly what
22   you can see.
23        A.   Yes.  I have it in front of me.
24        Q.   Okay.  Great.
25             And if -- you know, if we have any trouble on
0007
 1   that going forward, you know, we can take our time and
 2   work with it.
 3             And if -- if at any time you need to take a
 4   break, just -- just let me know.  I just ask, you know,
 5   that if I have asked a question, that you answer that
 6   question before we take a break.
 7             Does that sound good?
 8        A.   Yes.
 9        Q.   Great.
10             So can you tell me your current employer and
11   job title?
12        A.   My current employer is TransUnion Rental
13   Screening Solutions, and my current job title is
14   product manager.
15        Q.   And how long have you worked for -- is it
16   okay if I call it TURSS?
17        A.   Yes.
18        Q.   How long have you worked for TURSS?
19        A.   Just over eight years.
20        Q.   And have you always been a product manager or
21   have you moved through various job titles?
22        A.   I have moved through various job titles.
23        Q.   Okay.  Can you give me a quick summary of
24   your job titles over the years you've been with TURSS.
25        A.   Sure.  I started out as a criminal data
0008
 1   processor and then moved over to the account specialist
 2   team as an account specialist.  That was rebranded as a
 3   relationship manager team, so I was a relationship
 4   manager for a while.  And then I was a team lead of the
 5   relationship manager team --
 6        Q.   Okay.
 7        A.   -- one of the relationship manager teams.
 8   And now I am a product manager.
 9        Q.   Okay.  And what are your responsibilities as
10   a product manager?
11        A.   I have responsibility for the criminal and
12   eviction databases that TURSS has, as well as
13   responsibility for the matching logic.
14        Q.   Just to backtrack a little bit.  In your
15   initial job with TURSS -- and I can't read my own
16   handwriting -- as a criminal data processor; is that
17   right?
18        A.   Yes.
19        Q.   Can you tell me a little bit about what that
20   entails.
21        A.   Sure.  So one of TURSS's products has a
22   criminal recommendation service.  And so what I did was
23   I reviewed criminal records that returned on a given
24   applicant, and I reviewed those against policies that
25   were dictated by a TURSS customer to see it -- whether
0009
 1   those criminal records matched their policies in
 2   determining whether they were going to accept or
 3   decline that applicant based on their previous criminal
 4   history.
 5        Q.   Sure.  Would it be fair to call that
 6   adjudication?
 7             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
 8             Go ahead and answer if you can.
 9        A.   I don't know the definition of that word, I
10   guess.
11        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  And in your role as
12   an accounts specialist and relationship manager and a
13   team lead in that role, were you mostly working with --
14   with -- through these clients with landlords and
15   employers?  Is that accurate?
16        A.   I primarily worked with the resellers of
17   TURSS data.  I worked for the background data solutions
18   product.
19        Q.   I see.
20             And what were your responsibilities in that
21   role?
22        A.   So initially, as an accounts specialist and
23   relationship manager was to manage the relationships
24   that TURSS has with those resellers to make sure, you
25   know, customer satisfaction and all that good stuff.
0010
 1             And then as a team lead, I managed more of
 2   the key accounts as well as the other relationship
 3   managers that were on the team.
 4        Q.   I see.
 5             And can you tell me a little bit about your
 6   educational background.
 7        A.   Yes.  I have a bachelor of arts in psychology
 8   from the University of Texas in San Antonio.
 9        Q.   And when -- what year did you graduate?
10        A.   That was 2011.
11        Q.   So if I'm doing my math right, has working
12   for TURSS been your career post graduation?
13        A.   Yes.
14        Q.   Got it.
15             And I was cruising your LinkedIn page.  Are
16   you also pursuing an additional degree?
17        A.   I am.
18        Q.   Can you tell me about that.
19        A.   Yeah.  I'm a JD candidate at the Denver
20   University Sturm College of Law.
21        Q.   Okay.
22        A.   The projected graduation date of 2022.
23        Q.   And you're, essentially, going at night.  Is
24   that fair?
25        A.   It's a weekend program.
0011
 1        Q.   Cool.
 2             Just because you have that -- or you know,
 3   you're obtaining that legal training, do you have any
 4   responsibilities for legal compliance or FCRA
 5   compliance in your current role?
 6        A.   Can you -- can you be more specific on that?
 7             I'm not working in a -- in a -- like a
 8   compliance capacity or anything like that.
 9        Q.   Sorry.  You said you're not in a compliance
10   capacity?
11        A.   Right.  I'm not in a role on the compliance
12   team or anything like that.  But...
13        Q.   Got it.  Okay.
14             So in your -- in your current job, you
15   mentioned that you have responsibilities for the
16   criminal and eviction database and the matching logic.
17   And I wanted to sort of zoom in on each of those.
18             What -- well, let me just start with a broad
19   question, and -- and we'll go from there.
20             For each of those, would you have described
21   your responsibilities as more managerial or more --
22   kind of technical?
23             Are you -- are you a tech person or -- or
24   not?
25             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague and compound.
0012
 1   Form.
 2             Go ahead and answer, if you can,
 3   Mr. Landreth.
 4        A.   I don't consider my job very technical.  I
 5   consider it more strategic.  Although I've -- I'm
 6   growing in -- I'm still growing into the role.  But I
 7   don't consider it as a technical role.
 8        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Sure.
 9             And how long have you been the product
10   manager?
11        A.   Since August 5th of this year.
12        Q.   Okay.  So just a few months?
13        A.   Yep.  Or -- yep.
14        Q.   Okay.  So your responsibilities with the
15   criminal and evictions database, can you summarize kind
16   of the scope of your role with respect to the -- to
17   managing that database?
18             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Form.
19   Compound.  Calls for a narrative.
20             Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.
21             I was going to say if you need to have the
22   question read back, you can.  But if not, then just go
23   ahead and answer the question.
24        A.   Can I have the question read back or
25   repeated?
0013
 1        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  I can just rephrase it if
 2   that's helpful.
 3             Can you generally summarize your
 4   responsibilities with respect to managing the criminal
 5   and eviction database?
 6        A.   Yep.  So I'm in charge of -- of maintaining
 7   -- managing the database from the perspective of making
 8   sure it fits the needs of our customers and maintains
 9   its compliance standards.
10        Q.   Okay.  So what does that -- what does that
11   mean in terms of like -- in terms of your day-to-day
12   with the database?
13             Like, what might, you know -- what might you
14   have done yesterday or the day before with respect to
15   managing the database?
16             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Form.  Vague.
17   Compound.
18             Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.
19        A.   So day-to-day BAU type of work would be -- I
20   mean, a good example would be we update the database
21   on a biweekly basis.  And my team -- an analyst and a
22   specialist that work for me -- do the QA work --
23   basically, quality assurance work -- to make sure the
24   updates are what we expect and there's no degradation
25   of the database.
0014
 1        Q.   Okay.  How big is your team?
 2        A.   I have -- there's myself and then I have a
 3   specialist and an analyst that work for me.  So three.
 4        Q.   Okay.  So three including you?
 5        A.   Uh-huh.
 6        Q.   And so you have relationships with the
 7   companies that supply this data on a biweekly basis, or
 8   is that someone else in TURSS that has those
 9   relationships?
10             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
11        A.   Yeah.  I don't know what you mean by "has the
12   relationships."  I work with some of the vendors, but
13   I'm not -- I'm not in charge of contract negotiations
14   or things like that.
15        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  But on -- when it
16   comes -- when it comes to this QA you were telling me
17   about, if there was an issue with the update provided
18   by a supplier, would you be the person to contact the
19   supplier about that -- that issue and work to resolve
20   it with them?
21        A.   Depending on the issue, I might be, or it
22   might be one of my team members.
23        Q.   Got it.
24             And in terms of the match logic, can you tell
25   me what your responsibilities with respect to the match
0015
 1   logic are?
 2        A.   Yeah.  I think my responsibilities now are to
 3   maintain the match logic, the fidelity of the match
 4   logic, and again, make sure it suits the needs of all
 5   of our clients, that various TURSS products that use
 6   the criminal and eviction data, and hopefully, improve
 7   it over time.
 8        Q.   My -- is it accurate to say that the match
 9   logic comes from -- through this parent company,
10   TransUnion?
11             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague as to the term
12   "comes from."
13             Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.
14        A.   It certainly was influenced by a TransUnion's
15   match logic that they had developed over the past few
16   decades.  But it is distinct from TransUnion's match
17   logic now.
18        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Oh, I see.  And if a
19   change is going to be made to the match logic, what's
20   -- what's the process for that?
21             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Calls for a
22   narrative.
23             Can you repeat the question, Ms. Court
24   Reporter.
25             THE COURT REPORTER:  Question:  "Oh, I see.
0016
 1   And if a change is going to be made to the match logic,
 2   what's -- what's the process for that?"
 3        A.   So if a change were going to be made, we
 4   would -- we would analyze the before-and-after effects
 5   of that change, review it with our business -- senior
 6   business leadership as well as our in-house legal
 7   counsel to approve those changes.
 8        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Is that sometimes
 9   referred to as the champion-challenger process?
10        A.   Yes.
11        Q.   Okay.  Before we go too deep, I want to
12   circle back on some background.
13             Can you tell me what you did to prepare for
14   your deposition today without telling me the contents
15   of any of your discussions with counsel.
16        A.   Sure.  I met with Michael and Albert
17   yesterday, as well as TURSS's in-house counsel, Matt
18   Killeen.
19        Q.   And anyone else you've met with or spoke with
20   in the course of that preparation?
21        A.   No.
22        Q.   What documents did you review in the course
23   of that preparation?
24        A.   I don't recall all the documents.  Some of
25   them, I think, were the TURSS exhibits.  But we
0017
 1   reviewed those briefly.  So I don't remember all of the
 2   specific ones.
 3        Q.   Did you review any of the legal filings in
 4   this case?
 5        A.   No.
 6        Q.   Are you familiar with the -- the facts or
 7   allegations filed in this case or no?
 8             MR. O'NEIL:  I would ask the witness to
 9   exclude from his answer any information he received
10   from lawyers in connection with the case.
11             And with that exclusion, you can answer the
12   question, Mr. Landreth.
13        A.   So nothing outside of discussions with the
14   attorneys here.
15             MR. HASHMALL:  Okay.  I actually just have a
16   question briefly for Mr. O'Neil.  In our -- in our
17   letter to you on July 29, we noted the insufficiency of
18   the witness on a couple of the 30(b)(6) topics,
19   specifically topics 3 or 4 -- 3 and 4.  And because
20   those are related to the match logic and this witness
21   seems to have some familiarity with the match logic, I
22   just wanted to be clear and ask whether or not this
23   witness is going to be designated on either of those
24   topics.
25             MR. O'NEIL:  Well, I was somewhat confused
0018
 1   that you did not ask us formally for an additional rule
 2   30(b)(6) witness.  Instead you asked for Mr. Landreth
 3   to be -- to be deposed.  And he's available, and he
 4   could probably answer questions about the match logic.
 5   But I -- because you never asked us to -- to make a
 6   further Rule 30(b)(6) witness available, we did not
 7   contemplate identifying Mr. Landreth as such a witness.
 8   But...
 9             MR. HASHMALL:  Okay.  Well, I think -- I
10   think that narrative misstates the contents of the
11   letter.  I think the letter did pretty explicitly ask
12   for an additional 30(b)(6) witness to designate.  But I
13   understand your answer as indicating Mr. Landreth is
14   not so designated.
15        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  So I'd like to show you --
16   if you can grab that tablet -- a document that has
17   previously been marked as Exhibit 13.
18             If you -- it should be showing up on your
19   screen now.  And it is somewhat lengthy, about 30
20   pages.  You can slide back and forth to scroll through
21   it.  But I am -- I'll let you know that -- at least,
22   initially -- I'm going to be focusing on the first
23   couple of pages.
24             MR. O'NEIL:  I'm sorry, Mr. Hashmall.  I just
25   wanted to object to the use of this software to display
0019
 1   documents to the witness.  The witness has never seen
 2   this software, is not familiar with it.  I haven't
 3   taken any training on how to use it.
 4             As you well know, prior efforts by
 5   plaintiff's counsel in this case to use this software
 6   has been problematic.  So I object to the use of this
 7   software to display this exhibit and potentially other
 8   exhibits, which really do not lend themselves to being
 9   reviewed on a tiny screen.
10             MR. HASHMALL:  Noted.
11        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  So, Mr. Landreth, if you
12   -- take your time to look through this exhibit.  Like I
13   said, I mostly -- for starters, I'm going to be asking
14   you about the first two pages.  But let me know when
15   you're ready to discuss it.
16        A.   So are you in charge of this, or can I zoom
17   in or -- I'm confused.
18        Q.   You can zoom, and you can go back and forth
19   between the pages.  You should be able to do all of
20   that.
21        A.   Okay.
22             MR. O'NEIL:  He's going to have to zoom
23   because -- I don't know if you're using it,
24   Mr. Hashmall, but you really can't see anything in
25   detail on -- on the tiny monitor unless you zoom in.
0020
 1             MR. HASHMALL:  He can pick up the tablet and
 2   flip it on the side and see what happens, certainly.
 3             MR. O'NEIL:  There's a keyboard.
 4             I guess, can you pull the keyboard off?
 5             MR. HASHMALL:  Is that better or no?
 6             THE DEPONENT:  Yeah.  I think it's marginally
 7   better or will be better.
 8             Yeah.  Okay.
 9             MR. O'NEIL:  Is there a question pending?
10   Maybe it'd just make sense to ask a question rather
11   than have the witness fumble around with the tablet.
12        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  So looking at this
13   -- the first page of this exhibit, which is labeled on
14   the bottom TURSS 88.  My -- okay.
15             Without, you know, commenting on the
16   specifics of the individual who's filled in the
17   document, can you just tell me what this type of screen
18   is?
19        A.   I can --
20             MR. O'NEIL:  I would ask the witness to
21   exclude from his answer any information received from
22   counsel.
23             But if you can answer his question, please go
24   ahead.
25        A.   I can only speculate.  It looks like some
0021
 1   internal screen at TURSS.  Some sort of -- some -- one
 2   of the tools we have at TURSS.
 3        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  So are you familiar
 4   with the screen a applicant would see when they submit
 5   their information before a report is run on them?
 6             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Incomplete
 7   hypothetical.
 8             Go ahead and answer if you can.
 9        A.   I am not.
10        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Let's -- oops.
11             Let's move onto the next page, which is --
12   sorry -- which is labeled starting on 89.  It should be
13   on your screen now.
14             Does this type of screen look familiar to
15   you?
16             Is this something you see in your work?
17        A.   No.
18        Q.   Okay.  Well, I can represent to you that --
19   are you familiar with the enhancement process where an
20   individual submitted information as compared with
21   TransUnion's database and additional personal
22   information is added to it?
23        A.   Yes.
24        Q.   Okay.  So I can represent to you that a
25   previous witness testified that the bottom half of this
0022
 1   page shows enhancement information.  So there's the
 2   application -- the applicant submitted information, and
 3   then on -- below that, there is enhancement
 4   information.
 5             Does that make sense to you?
 6             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Misstates the record
 7   severely.
 8             MR. HASHMALL:  Severely?
 9             MR. O'NEIL:  Yes.  That's not what the
10   witness testified to and that's not what the document
11   is.
12        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Does that make
13   sense to you?
14        A.   It doesn't.
15        Q.   Why not?
16        A.   We don't log the enhancement information that
17   I'm aware of.  And I'm not a hundred percent sure
18   what's in front of me.  It looks like the beginning of
19   a credit report.  If that's the case, those two things
20   are not equal.
21        Q.   Okay.  So on -- for example, on the bottom of
22   this page, it lists the three addresses.  Do you see
23   that?
24        A.   Yes.
25        Q.   Assume the applicant only submitted one
0023
 1   address.  Where would the other two have come from?
 2             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Lack of foundation.
 3   This witness doesn't even know what this document is.
 4   And I think he's confused because you're misstating
 5   what the document is.
 6             But go ahead and answer if you can,
 7   Mr. Landreth.
 8        A.   So if the applicant only submitted one
 9   address, I'm not a hundred percent sure where these
10   additional addresses are coming from.  Again, if it's
11   the beginning of a credit report, that's not a product
12   I have any familiarity with.
13        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Talking about the
14   enhancement process generally, can you explain to me
15   how enhancement works for -- for example, for names?
16             MR. O'NEIL:  Mr. Hashmall, sorry to
17   interrupt.  But if you're asking about the enhancement
18   of address data for purposes of match logic as
19   Ms. Duncan testified to, then I think this witness can
20   answer that question.
21             And I have now looked back at your July 29
22   letter which has a sentence that says -- it says -- you
23   know, Ask -- Tell us if you're going to designate
24   Mr. Landreth on the same topics that Ms. Duncan was
25   designated.
0024
 1             And so we will designate Mr. Landreth as an
 2   additional Rule 30(b)(6) witness on the topics that
 3   Ms. Duncan was previously identified as a witness.
 4             So can you please, Ms. Court Reporter, read
 5   back the last question for the witness.
 6             MR. HASHMALL:  Sorry.  Just to go back, can
 7   you give me a -- precisely which topics you're going to
 8   designate Mr. Landreth on?
 9             MR. O'NEIL:  It's the same topics that -- I'm
10   sorry, Mr. Hashmall.  Give me a second.
11             MR. HASHMALL:  Sure.
12             MR. O'NEIL:  I think you issued an amended
13   notice of deposition pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) on June
14   20, 2019.  And Mr. Landreth will be designated to
15   testify regarding topic 3 and topic 4, which are the
16   topics that you requested additional testimony on in
17   your letter of July 29.
18             MR. HASHMALL:  Great.  Thank you.
19             MR. O'NEIL:  Sure.
20        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  So getting back on track a
21   little bit, talking about enhancement, can you tell me
22   your understanding of how enhancement works with
23   respect just to name data?
24        A.   Sure.  So an applicant would submit their
25   information, name, address, date of birth, Social
0025
 1   Security number.  And then that -- that's part of our
 2   -- what we call our enrichment process -- is sent to
 3   the TU database to confirm additional applicant
 4   information that might not have been submitted with the
 5   initial application.  And with respect to names, we can
 6   enrich with up to three different names.
 7             Regarding the logic of -- sort of which names
 8   we choose, I can't get into the specifics on that
 9   because I don't know it very well.
10             But we have the opportunity to enrich with,
11   you know, full middle names if they weren't provided,
12   or maiden names and -- and different things like that.
13        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Is -- is it also
14   possible to enrich from, you know, like a nickname, or
15   short and first names with full first names?
16        A.   Yeah.  I wouldn't refer to it as a nickname
17   or short and first name as far as the enrichment phase
18   goes.  But it is possible to enrich with a longer first
19   name.
20        Q.   For example, would "Bill" be enriched to
21   "William" or do you not know?
22        A.   It's possible.  It wouldn't -- not a hundred
23   percent of the time.
24        Q.   Okay.  And what about, like, suffixes, like
25   junior or senior or things like that, do those
0026
 1   sometimes get added in the enrichment process?
 2        A.   Sometimes.
 3        Q.   Okay.  And then with respect to -- to address
 4   data, can you tell me a little bit about how enrichment
 5   works with respect to address data?
 6        A.   Yes.  Address data is very similar to names.
 7   We look at the distinct addresses that are on that same
 8   file with the names.  We look at the distinct addresses
 9   and bring in up to 20 additional addresses beyond what
10   the applicant originally submitted.
11        Q.   Okay.  And do you know -- do you know if
12   there are, say, 50 addresses in the file, how the 20
13   are selected?
14        A.   I do not.
15        Q.   Okay.  Is there any enhancement done on date
16   of birth and Social Security number?
17        A.   I'm pausing to think.
18        Q.   Sure.  Take your time.
19        A.   There is enhancement that can be done with
20   Social Security numbers.  I'm not a hundred percent
21   sure about date of birth.
22        Q.   Tell me how enhancement works for a Social
23   Security number.
24        A.   For example, if an applicant did not provide
25   one, and we found one, it could be pulled in to be used
0027
 1   for matching purposes later.
 2        Q.   Okay.  So if the applicant provided a partial
 3   Social Security number, could that -- could it possibly
 4   be expanded to the whole thing?
 5        A.   I don't believe any of our products allow for
 6   partial entry in the Social Security number field.  But
 7   I don't know.
 8        Q.   Okay.  So then let's -- let me move a little
 9   further into this exhibit.  And I'm just going to sort
10   of fast forward you there.  I'm showing you the page
11   marked TURSS 114.  And let's see.  And I think I may
12   ask you about the following pages as well.
13             So take a look at that, and let me know when
14   you're ready to discuss.
15             MR. O'NEIL:  Look at what page?  Page 114?
16             MR. HASHMALL:  114 and 115, yes.
17        A.   (Deponent perused document.)
18             Okay.
19        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  So can you tell me what
20   this is?
21             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Lack of foundation.
22             Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.
23        A.   Are you referring to both pages?
24        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Yes.
25        A.   So it looks like the first page is a criminal
0028
 1   report from one of TURSS's products.  The second page
 2   is the continuance of that, as well as the eviction
 3   report.
 4        Q.   Okay.  And is this the type of thing that you
 5   are familiar with in your -- your responsibilities in
 6   your job?
 7             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
 8        A.   I do see criminal reports and eviction
 9   reports quite frequently in -- in the scope of my work.
10        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Sure.
11             And you're responsible for managing the
12   criminal and eviction database, correct?
13        A.   Yes.
14        Q.   Okay.  And the information on these pages
15   would have come from the criminal and eviction
16   database?
17             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Lack of foundation.
18             Go ahead and answer if you can about this
19   particular document, Mr. Landreth.
20        A.   So, yeah.  I think that's right.  Again, I'm
21   not responsible for how it gets mapped to this page.
22        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.
23        A.   And so there might be things that -- that the
24   product includes that I'm not aware of or things that
25   they omitted that were in the criminal database.
0029
 1        Q.   I see.
 2             Who is responsible for how the data in the
 3   criminal and eviction database gets mapped onto this
 4   page or onto reports?
 5             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague as to types of
 6   reports.
 7             Go ahead and answer if you can.
 8        A.   So I'm not sure the -- the -- I would start
 9   with the product manager of the product.
10        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  If this was a
11   SmartMove report, who would be responsible for the
12   mapping from the criminal and eviction database under
13   this report?
14        A.   From a product management perspective, that
15   would be someone named Kayleen.  And I don't know how
16   to pronounce her last name.
17        Q.   Okay.  And so can you give me a sense of
18   where your responsibilities end, in the kind of -- in
19   the kind of work flow as -- you've talked to me about
20   how records come in to the criminal and eviction
21   database and that you have a responsibility for the
22   match logic.  In terms of the actual matching and
23   records coming out of the database, is that outside of
24   your responsibility or outside of your purview?
25        A.   Can you repeat the last part of that.
0030
 1        Q.   In terms of records actually being matched to
 2   the database and then information coming out of the
 3   database, is that part of your purview or not?
 4             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
 5        A.   Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess I'm not sure of the
 6   question.
 7             I would treat -- I treat SmartMove as a
 8   customer of mine.  They use my products which are the
 9   criminal and eviction database.  They send requests.  I
10   do all the work -- well, I don't, but the system does
11   all the work to match records to their applicants, and
12   I send those records back to SmartMove.
13        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Got it.  Okay.
14             And when you send those records back, what
15   format are they in?
16        A.   They are in a format called -- I think we
17   call it, internally, the criminal entity or the
18   eviction entity.
19        Q.   The criminal entity.
20             And is that -- do you know what type of file
21   that is?
22        A.   I do not.  I believe it's XML.
23        Q.   Okay.  And does -- and is it fair to say it's
24   been the product manager's responsibility for
25   translating that XML into something like -- like you
0031
 1   see in front of you here on page 114?
 2             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
 3        A.   It would be the current product manager's
 4   responsibility to update or make any changes.  But the
 5   mapping was built a long time ago, so it's just -- I
 6   guess the responsibility is to -- to maintain it or
 7   update it or improve it.
 8        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  And do you know if it's
 9   been updated or improved in the last five years?
10        A.   I don't know.
11        Q.   Are you aware of any times it has been
12   changed?
13        A.   For SmartMove specifically?
14        Q.   Yes.
15        A.   No.
16        Q.   Okay.  So is it fair to say, looking at page
17   114, that the -- on -- as to the information submitted
18   by the applicant is on -- is in the top line, and then
19   the results returned followed below?
20             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Lack of
21   foundation.
22             Go ahead and answer if you can, sir.
23        A.   Yeah.  I can't -- what do you mean by "top
24   line"?
25        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  So where it says -- on the
0032
 1   top of page 114, it says, "Criminal records by state,
 2   William R. Hall, DOB 5-2-1968, SSN 186-58-2019."
 3             Do you see that?
 4        A.   Yes.
 5        Q.   Okay.  That's what I mean by top line.
 6        A.   Okay.  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know.  It's
 7   a SmartMove report which I've never dealt with in my
 8   eight years at TransUnion.
 9        Q.   You have no familiarity with a SmartMove
10   report?
11        A.   Not -- not their website, not their user
12   interface.
13        Q.   Okay.  And the -- the information below where
14   it says "Criminal Report," does that -- are you able to
15   identify that as information coming from the criminal
16   and eviction database?
17        A.   So where it says "Criminal Report," it has
18   the date there.  Below that is the applicant
19   information submitted, which is why I asked my question
20   about the top line.
21        Q.   Got it.
22        A.   So I believe that's the application
23   information -- applicant information that was
24   submitted.  And then below that, where it says "William
25   R. Hall," is the beginning of the credit report -- or I
0033
 1   mean -- sorry -- the criminal report.
 2        Q.   Got it.
 3             And so the information below where it says
 4   "William R. Hall" is information that came from the
 5   criminal and eviction database that you manage?
 6        A.   That information would have come from the
 7   criminal database.
 8        Q.   Okay.  And moving down to page 115, the
 9   sections labeled "Summary," "Comments," and "Court
10   Action," would those also have come from the same
11   database?
12        A.   The "summary" is not something that's in the
13   criminal database.  The "comments," which are blank,
14   would have been if they were there, if there was
15   anything there.  And then where the "court action" and
16   "court charge," those things would have come from the
17   criminal database.
18        Q.   Okay.  So looking -- and feel free to split
19   between those two pages.
20             Can you tell me ultimately where this -- this
21   information came from, you know, both in terms of its
22   original source?
23        A.   Just -- are you talking about the criminal
24   report or --
25        Q.   Yeah.  Just focusing on the criminal report.
0034
 1        A.   So the dataset name indicates to me that it
 2   was a dataset that ultimately came from the South
 3   Carolina Department of Corrections.
 4        Q.   Okay.  And TURSS received that information
 5   via a vendor; is that right?
 6        A.   Correct.
 7        Q.   And is that under Themis?
 8        A.   Yes.
 9        Q.   And this -- the information -- the
10   identifying information, the physical details, and then
11   the things like date of birth, page, Social Security
12   number -- which are blank -- would those also have come
13   or -- from the South Carolina Department of Corrections
14   via Themis.
15        A.   So what we're looking at on the SmartMove
16   criminal report, that stuff came from the criminal
17   database.  I don't know that -- that SmartMove has
18   mapped everything.  But the things on the page came
19   from Themis to the criminal database.
20        Q.   Okay.  So, for example, it says -- next to
21   Age, it says, "N/A."
22             Do you see that?
23        A.   Yes.
24        Q.   Is it possible that in the criminal and
25   eviction database, there was actually age data and it
0035
 1   just didn't get mapped on this report?
 2        A.   Yes.
 3        Q.   Do you have any sense of why that might be?
 4        A.   I don't.  That would be up to SmartMove.
 5        Q.   Okay.
 6        A.   But --
 7        Q.   And that would be -- the Kaylene person you
 8   referenced earlier?
 9        A.   Now.  Yeah.
10        Q.   How long has she been in charge of the
11   product?
12        A.   I am not sure.  I think -- yeah, I don't
13   know.
14        Q.   Months?  Years?
15        A.   More than a few months, less than a few
16   years.
17        Q.   Okay.  Who was it previously?
18        A.   I believe it was Steve Hansen.
19        Q.   Is Mr. Hansen still with TURSS?
20        A.   Yes.
21        Q.   Okay.  I would like to show you another
22   document.  It should pop up now.  It has previously
23   been marked as Exhibit 30.  Feel free to take a look at
24   it.  It's two pages -- or sorry -- three pages.  And
25   let me know when you're ready to -- to address it.
0036
 1        A.   Just to confirm, you're talking about 296,
 2   297, and 298?
 3        Q.   Yes.  Thank you for clarifying.
 4        A.   Okay.
 5             (Deponent perused document.)  Okay.
 6        Q.   So are you familiar with the documents of
 7   this type in your position?
 8        A.   Somewhat.
 9        Q.   Can you tell me what this is?
10        A.   This looks like a printout of the record we
11   were looking at earlier, but from the criminal
12   database.
13        Q.   Okay.  So it's a printout of the -- from the
14   -- from the database that -- that you manage?
15        A.   It looks like that.  The reason I say it
16   looks like that is it's -- it's a -- it's rows instead
17   of columns.  I'm used to all of these things being
18   columns.  And it's very horizontal, the way I normally
19   look at it, and this is very vertical.  But it looks
20   like it's all the same fields that would be in the
21   criminal database.
22        Q.   Got it.
23             So I would just like to go through and
24   discuss some of these fields and see if I can get a
25   better understanding of them, and that would help me.
0037
 1   And we can just start from the top.
 2             Do you know what -- what "identity ID" means?
 3        A.   That is a unique number to this -- to the
 4   combination of identity information that's on this
 5   record.
 6        Q.   And when you say "identity information," do
 7   you mean the -- the defendant's name, or do you mean
 8   something different?
 9        A.   I mean -- hold on.  I'm just looking.
10        Q.   Yeah.  Take your time.
11        A.   I think it goes all the way down to "date
12   time modified" on 297.  That is the identity table, all
13   of the columns that would be in the identity table.
14   And so that identity ID is unique all the way across
15   that row, if that makes sense.  It probably doesn't.
16        Q.   So this is -- is it fair to say this is a
17   unique identifier for -- for this entire criminal
18   record?
19        A.   Not necessarily.  It is in this case, in this
20   record.  But that's not necessarily true across the
21   database.
22        Q.   Why not?
23        A.   There can be multiple defendants on criminal
24   records.
25        Q.   Oh, I see.  I see.
0038
 1             So the identity ID is unique to the record;
 2   it's not to the defendant.  Is that right?
 3        A.   Identity ID is unique to this defendant on
 4   this record.
 5        Q.   Oh, okay.  So if there are multiple
 6   defendants, would there be multiple identity IDs?
 7        A.   Yes.
 8        Q.   Got it.  Got it.  Okay.
 9             So this identity ID is about William Hall in
10   this particular court proceeding.  Is that fair?
11        A.   The identity ID only goes down to, like I
12   said, date time modified.  And then the next set of
13   rows there are in a different table.
14        Q.   Yeah.
15        A.   So that --
16        Q.   Okay.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt
17   you.  Please continue.
18        A.   Well, I think that's all I have to say about
19   that.
20        Q.   Okay.  On -- the next one down is "source
21   ID."  Can you tell me what that is?
22        A.   The best way to think of the source ID is
23   actually just where the "state key" is.  It's -- it's a
24   unique number to identify the source of the data.  The
25   state key is the same thing; the five-digit state key,
0039
 1   which is next.
 2        Q.   And the state key here is listed as "SCCO2."
 3   And do you know, offhand, what that means?
 4        A.   No.
 5        Q.   If you'd like, we can flip back to Exhibit
 6   13, which says the source of this record was the South
 7   Carolina Department of Corrections.  If you -- feel
 8   free to look at that.  I'm not trying to pull a fast
 9   one here.
10             My only question is going to be whether you
11   think "SCCO2" refers to the South Carolina Department
12   of Corrections.
13        A.   I think that's true.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't
14   have all of our state keys memorized as far as what
15   source they go to.  So I think it's true in this record
16   that the "SCCO2" corresponds to a South Carolina
17   Department of Corrections dataset.
18        Q.   Got it.
19             And is there a document at TURSS that kind of
20   decodes that state key fields for following different
21   sources?
22        A.   Yes.
23        Q.   Okay.  And next, we have the "product type"
24   which is -- is "criminal."
25             Is that just, essentially, identifying that
0040
 1   this is a criminal record?
 2        A.   Yes.
 3        Q.   Okay.  I think I understand the next one,
 4   which is "searchable source state."
 5             Can you tell me what "criminal ID number"
 6   means?
 7        A.   That is a unique number to this criminal
 8   record.  That is -- it's something internal.  It's
 9   unique for TURSS.  So we can look -- like the way this
10   document was produced was probably by using that number
11   to identify everything to do with that criminal ID
12   number.
13        Q.   I see.  On -- and at some point on -- so I
14   think most -- the fields we've talked about so far,
15   these first -- one, two, three, four, five -- six on
16   this sheet, are all fields that -- if I'm understanding
17   you right -- are created or populated by TURSS
18   internally.  Is that right?
19        A.   I can't answer definitively for "searchable
20   source state."  But the --
21        Q.   Okay.
22        A.   But the others, I think that's accurate.
23        Q.   Sure.
24             At some point we're going to get into data
25   that came from the source.  Are you able to kind of
0041
 1   identify the span of records that came from the -- the
 2   source -- the span of fields, I guess, not records.
 3        A.   Yeah.  I mean, to exclude ones that didn't
 4   would take me some time to go through line by line, if
 5   you'd like me to do that.
 6        Q.   Yeah.  It might actually be helpful if you
 7   can, yeah.  Yeah.
 8        A.   So looking at page 296, skipping the fields
 9   we've already talked about, the "parent ID" is not
10   something that would have come from the source.  But it
11   came -- I believe it probably came from Themis.
12        Q.   Okay.
13        A.   I believe the rest on this page would have
14   come from the source.
15        Q.   Got it.
16             On --
17        A.   Sorry.  Except -- sorry.  Except for "photo
18   identifier."  That would have come from Themis.
19        Q.   Okay.  Let's -- I think this is helpful.  So
20   let's just press on and do the same things on page 297.
21        A.   So 297, you're seeing a lot of the same
22   fields as the last page because of -- it's -- there's
23   three different tables, and this is how they relate to
24   each other.
25        Q.   Okay.
0042
 1        A.   The "source_file_record _date,"
 2   "is expunged," "date time created," "date time
 3   modified," "HID_ID," "case ID," "state key," "identity
 4   ID," none of those would have come from the source.
 5        Q.   I see.
 6        A.   They would have either been Themis or TURSS.
 7        Q.   Got it.
 8             Then going down with the rest of the ones on
 9   this page would come from the source?
10        A.   I'm about halfway.  So...
11        Q.   Yeah.  Take your time.
12        A.   All the way down to "date time created" would
13   have come from the source.
14        Q.   Okay.
15        A.   Then after "date time created," "date time
16   modified," we're starting a new table here.  So again,
17   you'll see all those fields that are not populated --
18   or not from the source.
19        Q.   Okay.
20        A.   Starting at "sequence," it would be coming
21   from the source through the end of the page.
22        Q.   Okay.  And then there's only a little bit
23   left on 298.  So let's just keep pressing on.
24        A.   All the way down to "is expunged" would have
25   come from the source.
0043
 1        Q.   Got it.
 2        A.   The rest would not have.
 3        Q.   Sure.
 4        A.   Either Themis or TURSS.
 5        Q.   Sure.
 6             So one question.  I know -- is it your
 7   understanding that every two weeks when Themis sends an
 8   updated record, that the -- the old records are taken
 9   out of the database and completely replaced by new
10   Themis data?
11             Is that a fair way to characterize that?
12        A.   I think that's fair.  Yeah, it's -- it's a
13   replacement.
14        Q.   Okay.  And do these identifiers at the top of
15   the -- at the top of the records -- specifically, like,
16   "identity ID" and "criminal ID number," do those stay
17   consistent when the database is replaced in that way,
18   or are they regenerated or changed in some way?
19        A.   I think they generally stay consistent.  I
20   don't think that there's a rule in place that they must
21   stay consistent.  So I think there's a potential for
22   changing.
23        Q.   Why might they change?
24        A.   Depending on what changes within the identity
25   data.  So, you know, a court could add another name
0044
 1   here, a different name.  They could change "hall" to
 2   "hallway" or something like that, and that might affect
 3   those numbers.
 4        Q.   I see.  That makes sense.
 5             But if the underlying data stays the same,
 6   would you expect those identifiers to stay the same as
 7   well?
 8        A.   Generally, yes.
 9        Q.   Okay.  And then just to -- a good -- about
10   halfway down the page on 296, it does look like this
11   record came with -- with an "age."
12             Do you see that?
13        A.   I see the "age," yeah.
14        Q.   And again, feel free to look back to Exhibit
15   13 if you'd like.  But would it be fair to say that
16   "age" was present in the criminal and eviction database
17   but was not mapped onto the ultimate report?
18             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection to the extent that
19   you're suggesting, Mr. Hashmall, that document --
20   Exhibit 30 is the same moment in time as the record
21   that was included in Exhibit 13.  So I would object to
22   the extent that you're mischaracterizing the record.
23             But go ahead and answer if you can,
24   Mr. Landreth.
25        A.   Yeah.  It's hard to answer without knowing
0045
 1   when the Exhibit 30 was pulled out of the database.  So
 2   I can't say for certain looking at the two exhibits
 3   that "age" was present on this record the day that that
 4   report was run.
 5        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  I see.
 6             Okay.  But you can -- you can say for certain
 7   that age was present on the day that Exhibit 30 was
 8   pulled from the database?
 9        A.   Yes.
10        Q.   And it looks like birth date and birth year
11   were not present, is that accurate, on the day that
12   Exhibit 30 was pulled from the database?
13        A.   Yeah.
14        Q.   Okay.  And do you have records or tables
15   indicating what data you generally received from
16   various sources?
17             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
18        A.   Yeah.  I don't know if you can clarify that
19   at all or be more specific.
20        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Sure.
21             Again, to be more specific, is there a
22   document somewhere at TURSS that says, you know, for
23   this South Carolina Department of Corrections, we
24   usually receive age but not date of birth or anything
25   like that?
0046
 1        A.   There is a document that would indicate the
 2   number of records within this dataset that has age --
 3   that have age on them.  That's all metadata, though.
 4   It doesn't tie back to specific records.
 5        Q.   Sure.
 6             And is that historical or does that reflect
 7   to the database today?
 8             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Form.
 9        A.   We pull these from time to time, so it would
10   reflect the database as it existed on the day we pulled
11   them.
12        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Did you have a sense of
13   how frequently that's pulled?
14        A.   We typically do that biweekly, every other
15   week.
16        Q.   So what do you call that document?
17        A.   I would call that -- I think it's called the
18   "fill rate report."
19        Q.   And does the fill rate report include data
20   for the rate at which various variables are filled in
21   broken down by -- by source?  Is that fair?
22        A.   It doesn't have the rate.  It has counts.
23        Q.   Okay.  That's confusing.  It's called the
24   fill rate report, but it doesn't actually have rates?
25        A.   Correct.
0047
 1        Q.   Okay.  Would you be able to calculate a rate
 2   by, you know -- does it have the total number of
 3   records that you divide and come up with a percentage?
 4        A.   Yeah, that could be done.
 5        Q.   Okay.  So by -- going back to my question, is
 6   it -- does it have those -- does it have specifics
 7   broken down by jurisdiction, or how is it broken down?
 8        A.   It's broken down by distinct state keys, that
 9   five-digit key near the top of the page.
10        Q.   Got it.
11             And what use do you put those that you report
12   to?
13        A.   I -- my team puts it to use to -- like I
14   mentioned at the beginning -- to QA, the data, every
15   other week.  So we look at variances between fill rate
16   reports to see if there are any potential issues
17   indicated by that.
18        Q.   So, for example, you might say, Oh, state tax
19   used to report -- we used to get a hundred percent of
20   dispositions and now we're only getting 50; what the
21   heck is going on?  Is that sort of a basic example?
22        A.   Yeah.  Not at the state level, but at the
23   dataset level, yeah.
24        Q.   Sure.  Yeah.
25             And do you -- have you analyzed these fill
0048
 1   rate reports -- or have you looked at the fill rate
 2   with respect to age and with respect to date of birth?
 3   Has that been something you've focused on in your time,
 4   in your position?
 5        A.   The -- yeah.  The extent to which I look at
 6   those reports is the variances between them.  And so,
 7   you know, if date of birth changed drastically in a
 8   dataset or across the board from one update to the
 9   next, I would -- I would look at it in that respect.
10   Mostly, it's my team that does this stuff now.  So...
11        Q.   Sorry.  I didn't quite hear that.  Can you
12   repeat your last sentence.
13        A.   Most of the time, it's my team that does the
14   analysis.  And then, you know, escalates any issues to
15   me or the vendor.
16        Q.   Sure.
17             If they escalate an issue to you, do they,
18   like, write a memo or do they send you an email or do
19   they walk over to your desk?  Or how does that happen?
20        A.   It would be all of the above except memos.
21        Q.   Okay.  Okay.
22        A.   So...
23        Q.   All right.  Let's talk a little bit about the
24   match logic.  I think we've talked a lot about the --
25   about the criminal data.  I think that the match logic
0049
 1   would be the next -- the next thing.
 2             MR. O'NEIL:  Mr. Hashmall, sorry to
 3   interrupt.  But I was going to ask to take a break.  Is
 4   this a good time to take a -- take a short break?
 5             MR. HASHMALL:  This is a great time to take a
 6   short break.
 7             Do you want five minutes?  Ten minutes?
 8             MR. O'NEIL:  Yeah.  I think five minutes will
 9   work.
10             MR. HASHMALL:  Sounds great.  Let's go off
11   the record and meet back in five minutes.
12             (Recess taken from 10:50 a.m. to 10:58 a.m.)
13             MR. HASHMALL:  Let's go back on the record.
14        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Before I go to the next
15   exhibit, I just wanted to -- I have one quick follow-up
16   on the fill rate reports.  I was just looking at
17   testimony from a prior witness.
18             Is it -- is there -- within TURSS, their fill
19   rate reports also called variance reports?
20        A.   The variance report is the other thing I was
21   talking about where we compare the differences between
22   one fill rate to another.  So there are two -- two
23   separate documents.
24        Q.   So on -- am I correct in saying that if the
25   -- if the fill rate has changed significantly, then a
0050
 1   advance report might be filled out?  Is that -- is that
 2   accurate?
 3        A.   The variance report is always filled out when
 4   -- before we do a change.
 5             So to answer your question, we wouldn't know
 6   something changed drastically between fill rates
 7   without making the variance report.
 8        Q.   Got it.
 9             So -- is -- just to be clear, is the variance
10   report one of these things that's drafted biweekly or
11   it's only drafted when there's going to be a change of
12   procedures?
13        A.   It's done biweekly for the data updates.
14        Q.   Got it.  Okay.  That is helpful.
15             Okay.  I'm going to show you -- it should be
16   showing up on your page now -- a document that's
17   previously been marked as Exhibit 22.  It's a two-page
18   document labeled page TURSS 247 and 248.  And take a
19   look at that and tell me if you recognize it.
20        A.   I do recognize it.  The second page has it --
21   looks like a redaction, but...
22        Q.   Can you tell me what it is?
23        A.   Looking at the first page, I refer to this
24   document as the qualification table.
25        Q.   And can you tell me how it is used?
0051
 1        A.   This is -- this table represents one step in
 2   the match logic -- the qualifications step.  So --
 3        Q.   Okay.
 4        A.   Yep.
 5        Q.   And then let's run through the steps of the
 6   match logic, then.
 7             Is the qualification step 1?
 8             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
 9        A.   I don't understand the qualification step as
10   being step 1.  When I look at the match logic as the
11   products manager, I would consider in the enrichment
12   phase that we talked about earlier to be step 1.
13        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Great.
14             And then can you just walk me through the
15   steps and then that will help clarify our future
16   conversations.
17             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Calls for a
18   narrative.  Form.
19             Are you asking for a high-level listing of
20   what you call steps, Mr. Hashmall?
21             MR. HASHMALL:  Yeah.  That's what I'm asking
22   for.
23             MR. O'NEIL:  Go ahead and answer if you can,
24   Mr. Landreth.
25        A.   Yeah.  So very high level, we get the
0052
 1   applicant's information, we do the enrichment phase,
 2   then we pull records out of the criminal database -- so
 3   we call that the scoop -- then we do the qualification,
 4   and then the disqualification, and then some additional
 5   filtering that we've made on top of that.
 6        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  So we talked about
 7   enrichment.  Can you tell me how the scoop works?
 8        A.   So after enrichment, when we have the names
 9   and addresses that we want to use -- dates of birth,
10   SSN -- we look at the criminal database to determine
11   which records we think might be a match.  And those
12   records are then sent to the next step, the next phase
13   in the matching logic.
14        Q.   How did you determine what might be a match
15   in that scoop step?  Is it just -- how broad of -- or
16   what needs to match in order for it to be pulled into
17   that step?
18             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.  Incomplete
19   hypothetical.  Calls for a narrative.
20             Go ahead and answer if you can, Mr. Landreth.
21        A.   Yeah.  There are clauses that were written
22   that I don't have memorized.  But that piece of the
23   process is generally to find records that might be a
24   match, like I said.  It's not -- it's not as tight as
25   we get later on in the matching process.
0053
 1        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Does it -- so you
 2   -- do you know -- for example, you know, does it need
 3   to match on name and one other matching characteristic,
 4   or is it just -- is just a name enough to match or --
 5   in this -- in this broader step?
 6             Can you put any kind of parameters on it?
 7        A.   Yeah.  Like I said, I don't have it
 8   memorized.  I could speculate.  I think most, if not
 9   all, of the clauses have more than one element
10   required.
11        Q.   Are the clauses -- you know, obviously, I
12   assume they are present in the code.  Are they -- is it
13   true that they are in code somewhere through the
14   system?
15             And are they present or written down anywhere
16   else?
17        A.   It is true that they are in the code.  I
18   believe they are written down elsewhere as well.  But
19   it's not something I work with a lot.  So I don't --
20   like I said, that's why I don't have them well
21   memorized or anything.
22        Q.   Sure.
23             If you wanted to find where else they were
24   written down, what kind of document would you ask for
25   or who would you talk to?
0054
 1        A.   Well, if -- so I could look in some places,
 2   some shared drives that, you know -- that my team has
 3   and uses.  Or if I couldn't find them, I would ask a
 4   developer to interpret the code and write it down.
 5        Q.   Okay.  What -- if you were looking at a
 6   shared drive, what type of document would you be
 7   looking for?  What would it be called?
 8        A.   I don't -- I don't know.  I'd search the word
 9   "clause," probably, and see if I can find it that way.
10        Q.   Clause?
11        A.   Yeah.
12        Q.   Why "clause"?
13        A.   That's how they are referred to, as the scoop
14   clauses, I think.
15        Q.   Scoop clauses.  I see.  Okay.
16             So in the broad overview of the process that
17   -- the match logic -- you gave me, the step 3 is then
18   the qualification step, which relates to this table,
19   Exhibit 22, you have in front of you.
20             Can you give me a broad overview of how this
21   table works?
22        A.   Sure.
23             So looking at the top row, there are columns
24   for Name, Low and High; Address, Low and High; SSN, Low
25   and High; and Date of Birth, Low and High.
0055
 1             Prior to the qualification step, all of those
 2   fields are scored, and those scores feed into this
 3   table.  So if the scores for each of those fields
 4   matches the ranges in each of those rows -- or in one
 5   row all the way across, the record would go onto the
 6   next step.
 7        Q.   Got it.
 8             And there are additional tables for name,
 9   address, Social Security number, and date of birth that
10   define how these scores are assigned; is that right?
11        A.   There are additional tables that -- that you
12   can use to -- for those scoring.  But I'm not sure
13   those tables really define what score is what.  But...
14        Q.   Okay.  And it's true that if any of the
15   conditions on any of these 33 rows are matched, then
16   that record has passed the qualification set.  Is that
17   fair to say?
18        A.   Well, there's 35 rows.  Like I said, the two
19   on the next page, I think they were highlighted in the
20   Xcel document that this was probably translated from.
21        Q.   I see.
22        A.   But as it goes down from 1 to 35, if a record
23   meets the criteria within one of the rows, it moves
24   onto the next step.
25        Q.   Got it.
0056
 1             And generally speaking, is it fair to say a
 2   score of 1 is a really good match and a score of 99 is
 3   not a match?
 4        A.   Yes.
 5        Q.   And the lower the number, the better the
 6   match?
 7        A.   That is generally true.
 8        Q.   Okay.  Are the numbers 99 and 88, do they
 9   have special significance?
10        A.   Yeah.  Like you said earlier, 99 would
11   indicate a nonmatch and 88 would be indeterminate.
12        Q.   What does "indeterminate" mean in this
13   context?
14        A.   So when you're looking at the scoring, you're
15   comparing one name to another -- the criminal record
16   name versus, say, the applicant name.  "Indeterminate"
17   means one or more is not present.
18        Q.   Got it.  Okay.
19             So, for example, we're now looking at the
20   underlying tables.  But if I were to put this into --
21   put in precise plain English, I might say, Well, row 1
22   means a pretty good match on the name and a pretty good
23   match on the address, no match on Social Security
24   number, date of birth not present.  That will allow you
25   to match on row 1.
0057
 1        A.   Is there a question?
 2        Q.   Yeah.  Is that fair?  Would you agree or
 3   disagree with that statement?
 4        A.   I would agree that, yeah, name is strong,
 5   address is strong.  SSN doesn't really matter for this
 6   row.  And date of birth either has to be matching or
 7   indeterminate.
 8        Q.   Got it.
 9             So for row 33, the bottom row on this
10   table -- and we'll look at the -- some of the
11   underlying tables -- it looks to me like for row 33, if
12   there's a really good name match and an address match
13   at level 9, there doesn't need to be any Social
14   Security number or date of birth present for there to
15   be a match.
16             Is that fair?
17        A.   I -- I would characterize "SSN" and "DOB" as
18   they must be indeterminate for this row.
19        Q.   They must be indeterminate.  Got it.
20             Do you do -- or have you -- you or your team
21   -- ever conducted an analysis of what rows are the most
22   likely to generate a match -- or most likely to qualify
23   a record rather?
24        A.   We do.  We look at counts of records by
25   qualification row as part of the champion-challenger
0058
 1   process.
 2        Q.   Okay.  Do you know offhand which -- which
 3   rows are most likely to -- to qualify a record?
 4        A.   I don't, off the top of my head.
 5        Q.   Okay.  I mean, is it fair to say that most
 6   criminal records don't include a Social Security
 7   number?
 8        A.   That is fair to say, yes.
 9        Q.   So would it also be fair to say that rows --
10   say 17 through 29 -- which all seem to include -- to
11   require pretty good Social Security match are not
12   frequently used when criminal records are qualified?
13        A.   Yeah.  I mean, if I'm following your logic, I
14   think that's probably fair to say, although I don't
15   know that.
16        Q.   Okay.  Let's take a look on -- I'm going to
17   show you, actually, two exhibits.  I think you should
18   be able to toggle between them.  But if you're not, I'm
19   happy to do it for you.
20             Let me show you a document that's previously
21   been labeled as Exhibit 27, and then a document that's
22   previously been labeled as Exhibit 28.  And these are
23   two versions of what appear to be the same thing as
24   they are both labeled "Criminal Record Address Ranks
25   Table" -- and -- or one is labeled "Criminal Address
0059
 1   Ranks Table" and one is labeled "Criminal Record
 2   Address Levels."
 3             And my -- you can take a look at both of
 4   them.  And -- but you should know that my first
 5   question is going to be whether or not you know which
 6   one of these is presently in effect.
 7        A.   Yeah.  How do I -- can you go back to 27?  I
 8   don't know how to do it.
 9        Q.   Yes.  So here is 27.
10        A.   So between 27 and 28, they are different.  I
11   believe both of them exist in the match logic.  28 --
12   28 is going to be what feeds into what we were just
13   looking at, the qualification table.
14        Q.   Okay.  What is 27?
15        A.   That's just -- that's the ranks table, which
16   is distinct from levels.
17        Q.   What are ranks used for?
18        A.   So ranks, they are primarily used as part of
19   TransUnion's credit matching.  To my knowledge, TURSS
20   doesn't use this ranks table.  But I think it's in the
21   environment that we use for matching logic.
22        Q.   I see.  So because -- so I'm going to show
23   you -- go back to Exhibit 28, because it seems like
24   that's the most relevant.  But that leads us to a
25   larger question.
0060
 1             You testified earlier that these tables --
 2   and correct me if I'm wrong -- that these tables
 3   originated at TransUnion.  But is it fair to say now
 4   that TURSS has kind of custody over them and is
 5   modifying them as it sees fit?
 6             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague as to the term
 7   "them."
 8        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  By the -- by "them" I mean
 9   the tables we've looked at so far, Exhibits 22, 27, 28.
10        A.   So I don't know if this answers your
11   question, but TURSS has its own instance of the
12   matching service, and we can -- and have from time to
13   time modified some of these tables.
14        Q.   Okay.  Is it fair to say that the tables were
15   originally created by TransUnion?
16        A.   If I were to speculate, I would say yes.
17        Q.   And if TransUnion changes their matching
18   logic, do they communicate that to TURSS in some way?
19        A.   Not -- not always.
20        Q.   Do they sometimes?
21        A.   Yeah.  We're aware of matching logic changes
22   that TransUnion has made.  But --
23        Q.   And then -- go ahead.  Sorry.  Please finish.
24        A.   The TransUnion doesn't dictate match logic
25   changes for TURSS on a regular basis or anything like
0061
 1   that.
 2        Q.   Okay.  So when you become aware of -- by a
 3   TransUnion match logic change, do you consider updating
 4   it at TURSS or have you sometimes adopted those
 5   changes?
 6        A.   Like I said, I've only been a product manager
 7   for a month, so I haven't yet.  But I think, generally,
 8   we would look at what sort of impact TransUnion was
 9   trying to effectuate with those changes and see how
10   they might apply to criminal and eviction records.  And
11   then if we were to adopt them, we would do a
12   champion-challenger analysis the same as we always
13   would.
14        Q.   I see.  Okay.
15             So let's go back to Exhibit 28.  It is two
16   pages.  I think it's the -- the table has been broken
17   up over two pages.  I think it would have continued
18   across in the original exhibit at the Xcel document.
19             But are you, you know, familiar with the
20   contents of this table?
21        A.   Somewhat, yeah.
22        Q.   Okay.  So can you -- so I see in the -- just
23   kind of the body of the table -- a couple different
24   letters.  I assume that "Y" stands for "yes," and "N"
25   stands for "no."  Is that correct?
0062
 1        A.   Yes, that's correct.
 2        Q.   Can you tell me what "P" and "I" and "N"
 3   stand for?
 4        A.   So I would -- I would say -- I mean, here's
 5   how I would define each of the letters.  "Yes" being an
 6   exact match -- or "Y" being an exact match.  "P" being
 7   a partial match.  "N" being nonmatching, and "I" being
 8   indeterminate.
 9        Q.   Okay.  Do you -- what -- where did the -- are
10   you familiar with the underlying logic behind -- behind
11   those scores?
12        A.   Scores being the "Ys" and the "Ps" and
13   things.
14        Q.   Yeah, exactly.
15        A.   I'm generally familiar with that.
16        Q.   Do you -- for example, do you know how close
17   something has to be to be judged partial versus
18   indeterminate or not a match?
19        A.   I have a general familiarity with that
20   regarding addresses.  Obviously, it would be different
21   for the different columns.
22        Q.   Okay.  So let's take a look at -- for
23   example, street name.  So obviously, "Y" -- would "Y"
24   only apply if there's an exact character to prepare for
25   match for the entire street names?
0063
 1        A.   Yes.  I believe that's correct.
 2        Q.   Okay.  In what instance would you get a "P"
 3   for a street name?
 4        A.   I believe a P is one-third of the street name
 5   elements matching.
 6        Q.   What is a street name element?
 7        A.   So a descriptive example, 123 Main Street
 8   would have three elements.
 9        Q.   Okay.  So 123 is an element -- the number --
10   Main is an element, and then street is an element?
11        A.   Correct.
12        Q.   Is that right?
13        A.   Yep.
14        Q.   Okay.  I see.
15             And sorry.  You said that P is two out of
16   three?  I can't -- I've already forgotten.
17        A.   I believe it's one out of three.
18        Q.   One out of three.  Okay.  And then what
19   result is an "I"?
20        A.   "I" is indeterminate, so one or more isn't
21   present.
22        Q.   I see.  "N" would be zero out of three
23   matching?
24        A.   For the street name match column, yeah.
25        Q.   Got it.
0064
 1        A.   There's no Ns in the tables, so...
 2        Q.   Oh, sure.
 3             So, I see.  So, for example, to get in 88,
 4   which we decided was in no -- you know, there's nothing
 5   to compare it to, you get your -- your street name
 6   matches is an "I," because there's no data to compare
 7   it to.  Is that fair?
 8        A.   Correct.
 9        Q.   Okay.  So -- and on the left, there are
10   sequence numbers and levels.  Is it fair to say that if
11   you match any of the -- the given levels -- or any of
12   the given sequence numbers associated with the level,
13   you get that level?
14             Is that -- if that wasn't clear, I can
15   clarify.
16        A.   Yes.  I mean, it's a sequence number, so you
17   go into sequence, right?  And then if you satisfy
18   sequence number 3, you get a level 4.
19        Q.   Got it.
20             And also, if you satisfy sequence level 10 --
21   sequence number 10, you get a level 4 as well.
22        A.   Correct.
23        Q.   Got it.
24             So the code works its way down this table.
25   It starts with 1 and it goes all the way down to 30?
0065
 1        A.   That's a technical question.  But if you
 2   satisfy a row, it's -- like row 10, for example, it's
 3   not going to look at row 11.
 4        Q.   Got it.
 5             So is it fair to characterize level 9 as --
 6   actually I have a -- sorry.
 7             Just to look at the second page of this
 8   document, is this second page a kind of a computer
 9   translation of the -- of the -- of the first page?
10             Is that a -- would you characterize it that
11   way, or some other way?
12        A.   I know this as the programmers' view.
13        Q.   Okay.  Is it kind of a numerical version of
14   what is shown on the previous page?
15        A.   Yes.  It means the same thing to a programmer
16   that the previous page means to the business.
17        Q.   Got it.
18             So let's focus on the one that we can read,
19   which is page 290.  On -- is it fair to say that for a
20   level 9 match, any of sequences 21 through 29, that
21   what you need is for the state code to match?
22        A.   Yeah.  The state code must be an exact match
23   for any of the rows for level 9, yeah.
24        Q.   Okay.  And, in fact, for sequence 29, on --
25   if only this 8 is present, there's no street name, no
0066
 1   city name, and no ZIP code.  But the state matches,
 2   then -- then it's a level 9 match?
 3        A.   If -- if only the state code is present on
 4   either the record or the applicant information, then
 5   that -- that -- if it matched, it could level at a 9 on
 6   row 29 there.
 7        Q.   Okay.  So on -- for example, if you had an
 8   applicant who provided their full address on -- but --
 9   and then there was a criminal record with the same --
10   or there's a criminal record that only had the state
11   associated with it, that would qualify based on
12   sequence level 29.
13        A.   I wouldn't use the word "qualify" there.  It
14   could level at a 9.
15        Q.   It could level at at 9.  Got it.  Sure.
16             Because this is not the qualification table.
17   This is the underlying table; is that right?
18        A.   For addresses, yes.
19        Q.   Got it.  Okay.  And okay.  That is -- is
20   helpful.
21             Let's move on to -- I'm going to show you a
22   document that I'm going to mark as Exhibit 40.  It is
23   labeled as TURSS 259.  It is 23 pages long.  And it is
24   titled "Names Levels and Ranks Table."
25             Do you see that?
0067
 1        A.   Yes.
 2        Q.   Are you familiar with this table?
 3        A.   I am generally familiar with this table.
 4   It's a lot of table, though.
 5        Q.   Sorry.  Say that again.
 6        A.   It's a lot of table to be specifically
 7   familiar with.  But I am generally familiar with it.
 8        Q.   Understood.
 9             And so when we were talking about addresses,
10   there were two different documents; one gave levels and
11   one gave ranks.  This one seems to have levels and
12   ranks in the same table.  Is that right?
13        A.   Yes.  Several, yes.
14        Q.   So is it fair to say that for the purpose of
15   the match logic, you focus on the levels and not the
16   ranks?
17        A.   For the purposes of the qualification table,
18   yes.
19        Q.   Okay.  Got it.
20             And I don't want to go through every rank and
21   level here.  But I do want to understand the -- the
22   various characters in the table and then maybe go
23   across the top as best as we're able.
24             But let's start -- I see -- just looking at
25   the table here, I see again, Y, N -- Ys, Ns, and Ps.
0068
 1   But with all some sub variations.  There's Y1s, Y2s,
 2   Y3s, P1s, P2s, P3s.  So I'd like to touch on all those.
 3   Let's just start talking about the Ys.
 4             Can you tell me what the "Y" means on this
 5   table and what the variations in Ys mean?
 6        A.   So the "Ys" mean different things between --
 7   depending on what column they are under.  But Ys
 8   generally are exact matches.
 9        Q.   Okay.  So it looks like the place I see
10   variations in the Ys is, for example, in last name
11   match, I see Y1, Y2, and Y3.
12             Do you know what those are?
13        A.   Yes.
14        Q.   Can you tell me what each of those mean?
15        A.   So the way to think about Y is they are
16   different forms of exact match.  So for last name
17   matches, last names can have multiple elements.  So Y1
18   is an exact character-for-character match between the
19   two last names after removing spaces.
20             Y2 is that the name -- the last name with the
21   least amount of elements matches exactly with the first
22   part of the last name with more elements.  And Y3 is
23   that the -- the last name with the least amount of
24   elements matches the last name with the most amount of
25   elements, character for character, except the order of
0069
 1   the elements doesn't matter.
 2        Q.   Okay.  Let's -- let's take 2 and 3 again
 3   because I got confused.  And maybe some -- some
 4   examples would help.
 5             Would this apply, for example, in a sense
 6   where someone has, say, a hyphenated name and then they
 7   are also a junior?  Would all of those things be
 8   elements?
 9        A.   No.  This is just for the last name.  So the
10   junior would be a suffix.
11        Q.   Okay.  Got it.
12        A.   So this would be for last names with spaces
13   or hyphens.
14        Q.   Got it.
15             So if -- so if someone's last name was -- on
16   one record with Smith-Jones, and then the last name on
17   the other record was just Smith, would that be a Y2?
18        A.   Yeah.  I mean, so you're using the word
19   "record" and maybe differently than I would.  So I
20   would say when the applicant's last name is Smith and
21   when the record's last name is Smith-Jones, that would
22   be a Y2.
23        Q.   Okay.  And can you give me a similar example
24   for what would be a Y3?
25        A.   If the applicant's last name was Smith and
0070
 1   the record's last name was Jones-Smith.
 2        Q.   Got it.
 3             The difference between Y1 -- Y2 and Y3 is the
 4   order?
 5        A.   Yes.  Y2, it has to be the first parts -- the
 6   first elements match exactly between the two.
 7        Q.   Got it.
 8             Okay.  So I think we've covered the Ys.
 9             Let's talk about P.  I assume "P" means
10   partial again in this -- in this table; is that right?
11        A.   Correct.
12        Q.   But again here, for example, in the Last Name
13   Match column, I see P1, P2, and P3.  And are you able
14   to explain those?
15        A.   Not with the same degree of certainty I can
16   with the Ys.  But --
17        Q.   Okay.
18        A.   -- yeah.
19        Q.   Well, can you give it with whatever degree of
20   certainty you're able?
21        A.   Sure.  So Ps -- so these are different levels
22   of partial matches.  So the way I -- I guess the way I
23   would think of it is the elements -- so I know P2
24   better than I know P1.
25        Q.   Okay.
0071
 1        A.   But you can think with Addams with two Ds
 2   versus Adams with one D.  That would -- that would be a
 3   P1.  And then --
 4        Q.   Okay.
 5        A.   And then a P2 and P3 goes into those
 6   elements, like the different name elements, like Y2 and
 7   Y3 go into.
 8        Q.   Got it.
 9             Are there -- is there a document that -- that
10   defines these characters in TURSS?
11        A.   Yeah.  I think a Word document exists that
12   walks through some of these steps, yeah.
13        Q.   Okay.  Do you know what that would be called?
14        A.   I don't.
15        Q.   If you were going to ask someone to email you
16   that document, what would you say?
17        A.   Yeah.  I would ask someone to send me the
18   really long Word document that explains match logic.
19        Q.   Okay.  So then on this table there, there is
20   -- there are also "Ns," which I assume continues to
21   mean not a match -- or I think you had a better
22   definition for it?
23        A.   Yeah.  Nonmatching.
24        Q.   Nonmatching.
25             And then there are "Is" as well.  Does that
0072
 1   mean that particular data is not -- not present to
 2   match with?
 3        A.   Yeah.  "I" would mean indeterminate.
 4        Q.   Okay.  Okay.
 5             So let's take a look at the top -- sort of
 6   shaded -- shaded portion of this table.
 7             Just looking at the very first row, there are
 8   a number of different sort of categories.  There's
 9   Last-Last, First-First, First-Middle, and so on.  Can
10   you explain what that means?
11        A.   That's what is being compared between the
12   record and the applicant.  So the last name versus last
13   name.
14        Q.   Okay.  So on -- and then as you get further
15   into the analysis at some point, you're comparing
16   unlike elements; for example, you're comparing the
17   middle name to a first name?
18        A.   Yeah.  If there are Ys -- yeah, it looks like
19   there are.  So, yes, eventually, you do start doing
20   those comparisons.
21        Q.   Sure.
22             Because some people, you know, take their --
23   use their middle name as their first name, things like
24   that?
25        A.   I don't know.  I didn't design this, so I
0073
 1   wouldn't want to speculate the reasons for that.
 2        Q.   Okay.  So in the last-last comparison, there
 3   are two columns.  It looks like -- the first one it's
 4   called 1st Char.
 5             And can you explain to me what that -- what
 6   that column represents?
 7        A.   Yeah.  So this is what I was talking about
 8   earlier.  The Ys and the Ns mean different things as
 9   you go across columns.  But this is a first-character
10   match.  And so it can either be true or false.  So it
11   has a Y or an N.
12        Q.   I see.
13             And then there's Last Name Match, which we've
14   talked about a lot.  And I think I have a pretty good
15   understanding what that means.
16             So it looks like, for example, for the level
17   1s and the level 2s, you need a last name match.  But
18   for level 3s, you need -- you can get -- you can get a
19   qualification with a partial name match sometimes if
20   there's a first character match.
21             Is that -- is that fair?
22        A.   If you're just -- so you said "partial name
23   match."  If you're just talking about last name, that's
24   fair.
25        Q.   Yeah.  I'm only focusing on that last-last
0074
 1   comparison.
 2        A.   Okay.
 3        Q.   So then moving across this, there's a
 4   first-first comparison of the first name of the
 5   applicant with the first name on the record.  Is that
 6   right?
 7        A.   Correct.
 8        Q.   And then there's a 1st Char there and a Name
 9   Match.  I assume that analysis is similar to the
10   last-last that we discussed?
11        A.   The name match for first-first is -- so it
12   actually defines what type of match it is, right?  And
13   the last-last, it's called "last name match."  That's
14   the type of matching that's done.  That's why there's
15   Ys and Ps and different variations of those.
16             In the first-first, it's just name matching,
17   so there's only Ys, Ps and Is and Ns.  There's no Y1s.
18        Q.   So there's not -- I see.
19             Because first names aren't often hyphenated
20   and complicated in that way?
21        A.   Right.
22        Q.   Okay.  There's Nickname.  Can you explain to
23   me what that analysis is?
24        A.   Yeah.  So in a row with Nickname, we would
25   look at the Nickname table and compare the first name
0075
 1   to that Nickname table.  And if it matches the
 2   nickname, then that would be a Y.  If it doesn't match
 3   a nickname, it would be an N.
 4        Q.   Got it.
 5             And it looks like there aren't any Ns, at
 6   least on this first page I'm looking at, but there are
 7   blanks.  Does it ever populate the N, or is it just --
 8   it's just the Yes if the nickname doesn't match?
 9        A.   Well, I would have to look at all the pages,
10   but I would assume it would be a bad match.  If -- if
11   we're looking at the table and saying, No, there's no
12   nickname match, we wouldn't want it high up on this
13   table to score at a level 1 or 2.  It might be further
14   down the table if you want me to look.
15        Q.   No.  That's okay.
16             Then the next column is Shorter Within Long.
17   Can you explain to me what that means?
18        A.   Yes.  So if a first name is the shorter of
19   the two contained within the longer.
20        Q.   So, like, Tim and Timothy.  Is that an
21   example?
22        A.   I think that's a valid example, yeah.
23        Q.   Okay.  So then there's the first-middle
24   comparison which seems to mirror the first-first
25   comparison.  Is that fair?
0076
 1        A.   As far as what is looked at in that?
 2        Q.   Yes.
 3             Actually, I skipped a column.  But you can
 4   answer that question, and I'll come back.
 5        A.   It's similar, but there's a Name Pair column.
 6        Q.   Okay.  What does that column mean?
 7        A.   It's similar to nickname matching.  It's just
 8   a different table.
 9        Q.   Okay.  And then in First-First, there's a
10   column Length of Shorter = 1.
11             Can you explain to me what that column is
12   used for?
13        A.   Yeah.  It's just asking if the length of the
14   shorter of the two first names is one character long.
15        Q.   Okay.  Got it.
16             And now with disqualified, for example, the
17   shorter within longer match, if the shorter one is just
18   a single letter?
19        A.   Yeah.  So you're using the word "disqualify,"
20   which is much later in the process for me.
21        Q.   Okay.  Sure.
22        A.   But it -- the rows you're looking at here,
23   the values, all of this matching has already been done.
24   And so the length of shorter equals 1, when that is set
25   to "no," that's what that first -- that first row
0077
 1   looking at, among all the other values.
 2        Q.   Sure.
 3        A.   So this table isn't setting the value.  The
 4   values have already been set, and we're just seeing
 5   where on those tables those values fall.
 6        Q.   Got it.  That makes sense.
 7             So after the First-Middle category, there's a
 8   middle-first.  And is that basically the same analysis;
 9   it's just kind of -- it twists in terms of -- rather
10   than looking at the -- is the thing the first-first the
11   applicant name or is it the record name?
12        A.   I'm not sure.
13        Q.   Okay.
14        A.   It would apply the same either way.  But...
15        Q.   Got it.
16             So the first-middle, it compares either the
17   first name of the applicant with the middle name of the
18   record or the first name of the record that's the
19   middle name of the applicant, and the middle-first is
20   the opposite.  Is that fair?
21        A.   Correct.
22        Q.   Okay.  And then middle to middle is compared
23   to middle name of the applicant with the middle name of
24   the record?
25        A.   Yes.
0078
 1        Q.   And I see, under Middle to Middle, there's a
 2   Name Reversal column.  What does that mean?
 3        A.   The name reversal I'm less familiar with.  I
 4   believe it -- it works with multiple elements again,
 5   like we were talking about with the last name.  And it
 6   reorders them into all possible combinations and then
 7   compares them and the signs and the score.  But like I
 8   said, I'm much less familiar with that, so I can't get
 9   more specific than that.
10        Q.   Okay.  I think that's all I have about the
11   name table.
12             So I'm going to show you what's previously
13   been marked as Exhibit 29, which is also a four-page
14   document that is titled Date of Birth Levels and Ranks
15   Table.  It's also -- it's a four-page document starting
16   on page TURSS 292.
17             Do you see that?
18        A.   Yes.
19        Q.   Okay.  This one, it looks like shorter, which
20   is nice.  And I assume this is how the match logic
21   determines whether a date of birth is a match?
22        A.   Yeah.  It assigns it a level on a rank.
23        Q.   Sure.  And again, for the match logic, you're
24   more concerned with -- with the level than the rank; is
25   that right?
0079
 1        A.   For the purposes of the qualification table.
 2        Q.   Got it.
 3             So it looks like here, again, we have Ys, Ps,
 4   and then a P2.  Can you explain what -- and an N.
 5             Can you explain what those mean in the
 6   context to this table?
 7        A.   So, yeah.  I can't explain the P1s and the
 8   P2s on the date of birth.  I'm not familiar with that.
 9             But again, the Ys and the Ns would mean the
10   same thing as previous tables; it's just depending on
11   what column you're in.  But generally, Y means yes or
12   matching, and N means no or nonmatching.
13        Q.   Got it.
14             So it looks like -- just to go through the
15   columns pretty quickly, after Rank and Level, you get
16   Birth Date Overall Match, which I assume it just means
17   the whole birth date matches.  Is that fair?
18        A.   I think that's correct.
19        Q.   And then the next column is CCYY Match.  What
20   does that mean?
21        A.   So that's the century and the year.  So,
22   essentially, the year of birth.
23        Q.   Got it.
24             So "CC" is the first -- the two digits of the
25   four-digit year, and the "YY" is the last two?
0080
 1        A.   Correct.
 2        Q.   Got it.
 3             The next column is CCYY 1 Year Difference.  I
 4   think I can get what that means, but why don't you tell
 5   me.
 6        A.   So I think that's just looking at the year of
 7   birth and looking for plus or minus one year.
 8        Q.   Okay.  Then CCYY Position 1 and/or 2
 9   Difference, can you explain what that means?
10        A.   Yeah.  So comparing the two years of birth
11   are either of the Cs different.
12        Q.   I see.
13             So position 1 is the first C and position 2
14   is the second C?
15        A.   Yes.
16        Q.   Got it.
17             So the next column -- I think I'm learning --
18   is called CCYY Position 3 Difference.  So that would be
19   looking to see if the -- the first Y is different?
20        A.   Yep.
21        Q.   And so would that be -- to get a Y, if the
22   other three digits match, but that have one digit
23   doesn't?
24        A.   So that column is only looking at that digit.
25   So I think the answer is yes.
0081
 1        Q.   I see.  Got it.
 2             Then CCYY Position 4 Difference would look at
 3   the second -- second Y and determine if those two
 4   digits are different?
 5        A.   Correct.
 6        Q.   CCYY Position 3 & 4 Transposed, I assume that
 7   would look to see for -- for example, if 89 has been
 8   mistyped as 98.  Is that -- would that be an example of
 9   that?
10        A.   Yeah.  So that would get a Y in that column.
11        Q.   Sure.
12             And then Birth Date Estimated Condition, do
13   you know what that is?
14        A.   So I know, generally, that this is -- this
15   column is asking, Is this an estimated birth date?  But
16   to satisfy an estimated birth date -- like to say, Yes,
17   it is estimated -- I don't know what the logic is for
18   that.
19        Q.   Okay.  Then Month Match, I assume, it's
20   looking at whether or not the month matches?
21        A.   Correct.
22        Q.   And the same for Day Match?
23        A.   Correct.
24        Q.   Okay.  Now, I'm going to again show you two
25   exhibits previously labeled as Exhibit 24 and 25.  I'm
0082
 1   showing you two because these are the -- both labeled
 2   Disqualification tables.
 3             And my question was going to be which --
 4   which one is currently in use.  Again, if you want me
 5   to flip you back and forth between the Exhibits 24 and
 6   25, tell me, and I'll be happy to do so.
 7        A.   Okay.  Let me look at 25 real quick.
 8        Q.   Okay.
 9        A.   That's the one I'm on?
10        Q.   Yeah.  You're on 25.
11        A.   Yeah.  I'm -- I'm not sure if I'm going to be
12   able to get to an answer on which one is used right
13   now.
14        Q.   Okay.
15        A.   I'm not seeing a big difference other than
16   the highlighted row in -- or highlighted column in row
17   25.
18        Q.   Yeah.  Okay.
19             So let's -- let's just take a look at Exhibit
20   25?
21        A.   Okay.
22        Q.   On -- so you should have that in front of
23   you.  And can you just tell me -- so I -- in your -- in
24   your general overview of these, the match logic, after
25   the qualification steps, there comes the
0083
 1   disqualification step, which I assume had had to do
 2   with this disqualification table.
 3             But can you give me a general sense of how
 4   disqualification works and what it is?
 5        A.   Yeah.  So disqualification is only invoked
 6   for records that make it out of qualification.  And
 7   then similar to the qualification tables, it looks at
 8   the values that have already been assigned to these
 9   various column headers and to see if it satisfies a row
10   on the disqualification table.
11             And if a row on the disqualification table is
12   satisfied by the values that have already been
13   assigned, it is disqualified, and the record does not
14   proceed to the next step.
15        Q.   Got it.
16             I see.  So, for example, in row 1 in the
17   Disqualification table, if the SSN is 99, which is not
18   a match, then that record is disqualified.
19             Is that fair to say?
20        A.   It's got to -- it's got to satisfy all of the
21   values in all of row 1.
22        Q.   Okay.  So the Social Security number is not a
23   match.  The middle-to-middle comparison is not an alpha
24   match.  There's no name reversal.  There's no
25   middle-first use.  Then that record is disqualified.
0084
 1   Is that fair?
 2        A.   That's correct.
 3        Q.   Okay.  So let's just go through these and
 4   just make sure I understand the columns, and then we
 5   can -- we can move through this.
 6             So before I -- before we do the columns,
 7   let's take a look.  So it looks like there's a -- a
 8   combination of values on this table.  There are -- in
 9   some columns, you're looking at levels.  In some
10   columns, you're looking at these, you know, Ys and Ps.
11   Is that accurate?
12        A.   Yes.
13        Q.   So while you're looking at levels, is it fair
14   to say you referred to the relevant table and you
15   figure out what that level means?
16        A.   Yes.  I believe that's correct, yeah.
17        Q.   So, for example, for row 15 in the
18   Disqualification table, so I wanted to know what, you
19   know, what SSN level 1 was, I should look at the SSN
20   table and figure out what level 1 means.
21             Is that fair?
22        A.   Yes.
23        Q.   And the same for the Address level table.  If
24   I want to know -- if I'm looking at row 25 and I want
25   to know what address level 9 is, I should look at the
0085
 1   address table and see what level 9 is?
 2        A.   That's correct.  Although those levels and
 3   ranks tables aren't exactly descriptive on what a level
 4   9 might be or is in a specific case.  Right?  There are
 5   different criteria that can be satisfied for a level 9.
 6        Q.   Sure.  Thank you for clarifying that.  Sorry
 7   for speaking over you.
 8             And then on -- for some of these other
 9   columns, we're back to the Ns and Ps and Ys.  So -- and
10   it looks like -- where it looks like -- for example,
11   under First-First, that looks pretty similar to the
12   Name Match table.
13             And would it then be fair to say that the N
14   in the First-First block of columns means the same
15   thing as the N on the Name Match table?
16        A.   Yeah, I think that's correct.
17        Q.   And the same as the P and the Y and so on?
18        A.   Yeah, I think that's correct.
19        Q.   Okay.  And then I understand most of this,
20   then.
21             At the bottom of this page -- at the bottom
22   of page 255, there are a number of inactive rows.  Can
23   you explain to me what those are?
24        A.   I cannot.  I don't know.
25        Q.   Okay.  That is okay.
0086
 1             So on -- it looks like most of these columns
 2   are already columns we discussed in the name matching
 3   table or date of birth table.  But let's take a look at
 4   the -- I think one thing -- one column we haven't
 5   discussed is the generational suffix.
 6             Can you explain to me what that is?
 7        A.   So the gen suffix is -- it's like junior,
 8   senior, that type of thing.
 9        Q.   Okay.  And it looks like there are a couple
10   of different values there.  There's an N and then an
11   I1.
12             Do you know what an I1 is for -- in that
13   context?
14        A.   I do not.
15        Q.   Okay.  But N would mean there's no
16   generational suffix match?
17        A.   Yeah.  The gen suffix between the two are
18   nonmatching.
19        Q.   Sure.
20             So after enrichment and after the scoop of
21   the records and then after the qualification and the
22   disqualification, you mentioned that there were some
23   additional steps that were taken to -- before a record
24   is, you know, added to a report.
25             Can you tell me about those?
0087
 1        A.   Yep.  So we have -- after disqualification,
 2   we have two steps of what we call compliance filters.
 3   And there are some national FCRA filters and some
 4   specific statewide filters that we've implemented.
 5        Q.   Okay.  And you -- are you able to list those
 6   as you sit here today?
 7        A.   I am not able to list them exhaustively.
 8        Q.   Sure.
 9             Are you able to give me an example of one or
10   two?
11        A.   An example of an FCRA filter would be no
12   nonconviction records over seven years of age.
13        Q.   Okay.
14        A.   An example of a statewide filter would be no
15   nonconvictions regardless of age.
16        Q.   And that might be, for example, in
17   California?
18        A.   It might be.  I can't remember.  I think
19   there are a couple of states.
20        Q.   Okay.  Is -- is there a list of those
21   compliance filters written down somewhere?
22        A.   Yes.
23        Q.   Okay.  If you were asking someone to email it
24   to you, would you just say, Email me the list of
25   compliance filters, or would you refer to it in some
0088
 1   different way?
 2        A.   I'd refer to both sets, because I think
 3   they're -- I don't know.  They are probably written
 4   down somewhere together.  But I think I know of them in
 5   two different places separately, national FCRA filters
 6   and statewide filters.
 7        Q.   Got it.
 8             Okay.  I'd like to show you a document that
 9   -- sorry -- that has previously been marked as Exhibit
10   31.  And this has to do with -- do you know what this
11   type of document is?
12        A.   Yes.  This is -- this looks like XML, to me.
13   I can't say definitively that it is, but it looks like
14   that.
15        Q.   Sure.
16             Do you know what this XML document is?
17        A.   Yeah, I don't know.
18        Q.   I mean, is this similar to the type of thing
19   that comes out of the database you manage after all the
20   steps we've talked about?
21        A.   It looks like this is -- this is more akin to
22   something that comes out of one of TURSS's products
23   and is sent to a partner that integrates with us
24   technically.
25        Q.   Got it.
0089
 1             Let's talk -- we have a few more things to
 2   discuss.  I want to talk more about changes made to --
 3   to the procedures that you all receive.  We talked a
 4   little bit about the champion-challenger process.
 5             Have you run a champion-challenger process in
 6   the time that you've been in your current position?
 7        A.   No.
 8        Q.   Okay.  Have you taken part of that process in
 9   your -- in your prior roles?
10        A.   Yes.
11        Q.   Okay.  Would you say you're familiar with how
12   it works?
13        A.   Yes.
14        Q.   Okay.  And when was the last time you
15   remember taking part in the champion-challenger
16   process?
17        A.   Yeah.  It would have been early this year.
18        Q.   Okay.
19        A.   But I don't know.  Since -- between now and
20   March of this year.
21        Q.   Okay.  And do you remember what the proposed
22   change was?
23        A.   Not off the top of my head.
24        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever -- are you ever aware of
25   a champion-challenger that was run -- that had to do
0090
 1   with all the use of the age variable in the -- in the
 2   database or the match logic?
 3        A.   You're referring to the age that we looked at
 4   a few exhibits ago and from the database?
 5        Q.   Yes.
 6        A.   I am not aware of a champion-challenger
 7   regarding that.
 8        Q.   Okay.  And when a champion-challenger is run,
 9   what kind of documentation is produced?
10        A.   We produce an impact analysis.  The one that
11   we -- that we present to our in-house counsel, as well
12   as executive leadership, looks at the impact that the
13   change had both on our false-positives and our missed
14   records.
15        Q.   Okay.  And tell me -- tell me a little bit
16   about how those conclusions are reached.
17             What do you do to determine how the -- how
18   the proposed change would impact false-positives and
19   the missed records?
20        A.   So we look at samples.  It's a sampling
21   analysis between -- we look at samples of all the
22   variances.  So where the champion returned records and
23   the challenger didn't and vice versa.  And there are
24   different iterations of that.  We look at records and
25   confirm whether or not they match the consumer by
0091
 1   calling courts or sending court runners or things like
 2   that.
 3        Q.   Okay.  So would it be fair to call it a
 4   manual review process?
 5        A.   It's a manual review of sample data.
 6        Q.   Okay.  So how big is the sample?  Is there a
 7   standard size to this business process?
 8        A.   The sampling is always at 30 or all of them,
 9   whichever is less.
10        Q.   Sorry.  30 what?
11        A.   Yeah.  So this is the sample.
12             So like I said, champion returned records and
13   challenger didn't.  We would look at 30 cases of when
14   that happened and figure out if that result is good or
15   bad.
16        Q.   I see.
17             So I guess that's helpful, but my question
18   was a little broader.
19             So when you run the champion process and the
20   challenger process, how many records do you run --
21   those prophecy done before you do this review?
22        A.   We don't look at a specific number of
23   records.  With the last champion-challenger, for
24   example, we ran a hundred thousand applicants.
25        Q.   Okay.  By the way, every champion-challenger
0092
 1   doesn't necessarily run with that -- a number?  You
 2   might change it depending on the process?
 3        A.   Yeah.  I mean, I think that's our general --
 4   that's our general number.
 5        Q.   Okay.  So you chose a hundred thousand
 6   records -- or applicants.  You run the champion on
 7   those hundred thousand, you run the challenger on those
 8   hundred thousand, and then you look at where those --
 9   the results are different?
10             Is that a fair characterization of it?
11        A.   Yeah.  We categorize the differences, and
12   then we -- we manually review samples of the
13   differences.
14        Q.   Got it.
15             And that's where we said you either do -- you
16   manually review either 30 or -- 30 of the differences
17   or all of them, whichever is fewer?
18        A.   Yes.
19        Q.   Got it.
20             And then after that manual review process you
21   produce -- which you called, I think, an impact
22   statement, which then goes to the higher-ups would then
23   make the ultimate decision as to whether the change
24   would be adopted?
25        A.   Correct.
0093
 1        Q.   Okay.  How often do you think the -- would
 2   you estimate the champion-challenger process is run,
 3   say, every year?
 4        A.   Can you say the last word again?  Sorry.
 5        Q.   Every year.
 6             For example, how many champion-challengers
 7   would you expect to run over the course of the year?
 8        A.   Yeah.  I mean, we don't -- I don't know.  We
 9   run them when there's changes either that we want to
10   make or that we're asked to make or something like
11   that.  So I think, if I had to guess an average, it
12   would be two to four times a year.
13        Q.   Got it.
14             Can you characterize the types of changes
15   that lead to this champion-challenger process?
16        A.   I can give some examples.  I don't know if
17   they'll be exhaustive.
18        Q.   Yeah.  Examples would be great.
19        A.   But any time we want to change the match
20   logic, the champion-challenger must be run.  If we were
21   to bring in a new criminal or eviction data provider,
22   the champion-challenger must be run.  Those are the two
23   biggest examples I can think of.
24        Q.   Got it.
25             And when you say "change the match logic,"
0094
 1   would any change to any of the tables we looked at
 2   today trigger a champion-challenger?
 3        A.   Yes.
 4        Q.   Got it.
 5             So -- and are you aware of any time when
 6   consumer disputes have led to a change in the match
 7   logic?
 8        A.   I'm not aware.
 9        Q.   Okay.  Do you get -- or in your current
10   position, do you receive reports or summaries of
11   consumer disputes or types of consumer disputes that
12   are received?
13        A.   Yes.  So I receive a -- and my team is
14   responsible for metadata regarding disputes.  So it's
15   not summaries of individual disputes, but more along
16   the lines of how many -- how many of this type of
17   dispute did we get this month.  And we track those over
18   time.
19        Q.   Okay.  And if -- if you saw a significant
20   change in the type of dispute, it's going to say spike
21   in a separate dispute like that lead to a proposed
22   change in the match logic and the champion-challenger?
23        A.   It would lead to more analysis first, and it
24   could ultimately lead there.
25        Q.   Okay.  But you're not aware of any time that
0095
 1   that has specifically happened?
 2        A.   No.
 3        Q.   Okay.  You are on -- so you are based in
 4   Colorado; is that right?
 5        A.   Yep.
 6        Q.   Okay.  And TURSS is -- is headquartered in
 7   Colorado.  Is that fair to say?
 8             MR. O'NEIL:  Objection.  Vague.
 9             Go ahead and answer if you can.
10        A.   Yeah.  I mean, most of TURSS's employees are
11   in Colorado.  That's where we have our main office.
12        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  Okay.  Where else does
13   TURSS have employees?
14        A.   I think we have remote employees spread out,
15   and then -- I mean, yeah, I don't know of any other
16   place with a high concentration of TURSS employees.
17        Q.   Okay.  Do you -- do you work with TransUnion
18   employees at all on a daily basis on your job?
19        A.   Not on a daily basis.
20        Q.   How often do you think you're working with
21   TransUnion employees?
22        A.   Monthly.
23        Q.   Like, once or twice or three times a month,
24   something like that?
25        A.   Yeah.  Probably once or twice a month.
0096
 1        Q.   Okay.  And where are those employees usually
 2   working?
 3        A.   I think, typically, Chicago.
 4             MR. HASHMALL:  Okay.  I think we are almost
 5   done.  I would like to take ten minutes.  I know it's
 6   about lunchtime.  Obviously, if you want to break for
 7   lunch, we could.  But I do think we're almost done.  So
 8   it might not make sense to break for 45 minutes.
 9             MR. O'NEIL:  I would agree with you, Joe.  I
10   would agree with you.  Yes.
11             So you want to take a --
12             MR. HASHMALL:  Let's take five, and we'll
13   come back and see if I have any -- any little things
14   that I mentioned.  But I do think we're close.
15             MR. O'NEIL:  Thanks, Joe.
16             (Recess taken at 12:14 p.m. to 12:22 p.m.)
17        Q.   (BY MR. HASHMALL)  All right.  Let's go back
18   on the record.  I don't have a lot more to ask.  I
19   think I should have one clean-up question.
20             I'm showing you a page on Exhibit 40.  And I
21   just realize that I did not ask you about the final
22   column on this.  It says, Name Ranks and Levels Table
23   [sic], which is a little different from the other ones.
24             The -- in the middle of the comparison,
25   there's a column called Alpha Match, which I realize is
0097
 1   not part of the other comparisons.
 2             Do you know what an "alpha match" is in that
 3   context.
 4        A.   It's -- it's still just middle-to-middle
 5   comparison.  Alpha match is just a little bit different
 6   than name matching.  I don't know that I could
 7   succinctly -- I don't think I could explain the
 8   differences.  They are very similar, though.
 9        Q.   Okay.  Is it -- would it be fair to say it
10   allows for some amount of variation the name matching
11   doesn't, or is that not fair to say?
12        A.   I don't think -- I don't know.  I can't
13   answer that.
14             MR. HASHMALL:  Okay.  That is all I have
15   unless Mr. O'Neil has some questions.
16             MR. O'NEIL:  Thank you, Mr. Hashmall.  I have
17   no questions for this witness.  I thank the witness for
18   his time today, and we will reserve signature.
19             MR. HASHMALL:  Thank you, Mr. Landreth.
20             MR. O'NEIL:  Joe, talk to you later.  Thank
21   you.
22             MR. HASHMALL:  Yep.  Have a good one.
23             WHEREUPON, the within proceedings were
24   concluded at the approximate hour of 12:24 p.m. on the
25   5th day of September, 2019.     *     *     *     *

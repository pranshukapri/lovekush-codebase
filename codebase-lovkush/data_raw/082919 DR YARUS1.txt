           6   BY MS. MCCARTHY:

           7   Q.     Good afternoon.  Mary McCarthy on

           8   behalf of the plaintiff Fr. Mularczyk.

           9          Dr. Yarus, would you please introduce

          10   yourself to the jury.

          11   A.     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Your

          12   Honor, my name is Lance Owen Yarus, DO.

          13   Q.     How long have you been a doctor?

          14   A.     I graduated medical school in 1981.  I

          15   received my certificate at that time.

          16   Q.     You said DO.  What is your specialty?

          17   A.     I practice in the areas of orthopedics

          18   and pain management.

          19   Q.     Dr. Yarus, I have before you what

          20   we've had marked as Yarus-1 for

          21   identification.

          22          Can you tell us what that is.

          23   A.     This is called a curriculum vitae.

          24   Q.     What is a curriculum vitae?

                                                            7



           1   A.     It's basically a resumé.  It has my

           2   background, training and participation in

           3   activities as a physician both in the

           4   internship and residency program and as a

           5   treating individual, having started my

           6   practice 1986 and thereafter.

           7          It contains my board certifications,

           8   certificates and fellowships that I hold,

           9   some teaching affiliations that I have,

          10   subspecialty rotations and some of the

          11   courses that I've participated, appointments

          12   I've had and some editorial activities, as

          13   well.

          14   Q.     Is Yarus-1 accurate and up to date?

          15   A.     It is, yes.

          16   Q.     I'm going to ask you to refer to it as

          17   needed as we go through your qualifications.

          18          Can you tell us a little bit about

          19   your educational background.

          20   A.     I graduated medical school in 1981.

          21   After that, I did what's known as a one-year

          22   rotating internship.  You go through all the

          23   subspecialty areas in medicine, family

          24   practice, and you actually get the

                                                            8



           1   opportunity to see individuals in the

           2   hospital setting, work with various types of

           3   physicians in subspecialty areas.

           4          After that, I started my orthopedic

           5   residency, which is specific to the

           6   subspecialty of orthopedic surgery, and that

           7   was a four-year program.  I completed that as

           8   chief resident in 1986.  At that point, I

           9   started my practice.

          10   Q.     Can you tell us about your

          11   professional experience.

          12   A.     As far as what I do on a daily basis,

          13   I operated on individuals for over 30 years,

          14   provided conservative care for injuries and

          15   some disease states that have to do with

          16   joints, particularly where they wear out and

          17   you have to address that.  I took call in the

          18   emergency room for that amount of time and

          19   also treated individuals in the office

          20   setting.

          21          In the early 1990s, I started doing

          22   more formalized pain management, particularly

          23   injecting more areas of the body in the

          24   spinal column and joints, muscles, tendons,

                                                            9



           1   ligaments and nerves and doing that kind of

           2   work along with the individuals who have not

           3   only metabolic diseases again but injuries,

           4   as well.

           5   Q.     This seems like a silly question, but

           6   I have to ask.

           7          Are you licensed to practice medicine

           8   in the state of Pennsylvania?

           9   A.     I still hold a license to practice,

          10   yes.

          11   Q.     I believe you said something about

          12   board certification?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Can you tell the jury what you're

          15   board certified in and what it means to be

          16   board certified.

          17   A.     I have two certificates that designate

          18   me as being board certified.  There are three

          19   recognized boards in orthopedic surgery.  I'm

          20   certified by one of them.

          21          The process to get there entailed, in

          22   the first certificate, three years of taking

          23   tests and the last year actually being

          24   observed doing surgery in the operating room

                                                           10



           1   by two board certified individuals.  I

           2   reviewed records in the hospital and office

           3   setting.  That was all compiled, and I

           4   received my first certificate in 1989.

           5          The process after that is just to take

           6   written tests, and I did that successfully

           7   three times to the current time.  I hold a

           8   certificate that still designates me as an

           9   orthopedic surgeon.

          10          I stopped doing surgery in 2013.  I

          11   still see individuals because of the pain

          12   management side of treatment who have

          13   injuries, so it goes hand in hand, so to

          14   speak.

          15          Basically, for pain management, I do

          16   interventional techniques, injecting

          17   individuals and also treating and designing

          18   programs for people who require therapy and

          19   also modalities, such as medications, as

          20   well.

          21   Q.     You've already touched on this a

          22   little bit, but can you please describe for

          23   us in a little more detail your current

          24   orthopedic practice.

                                                           11



           1          What do you do on a day-to-day basis?

           2   A.     On a day-to-day basis, I see people

           3   who have injuries, metabolic diseases that

           4   are pain oriented.  Again, I see individuals

           5   who have issues with all types of injuries

           6   that occur for various reasons, such as motor

           7   vehicle accidents, trip and slip-and-falls,

           8   people who have Workers' Compensation

           9   injuries and those individuals who have

          10   sports injuries, as well.

          11          My role is to still figure out what's

          12   going on and design, as I said, a program for

          13   treatment.  A lot of times people are in

          14   therapy.  I'll go one step further and ask if

          15   they want to treat with other options that I

          16   have available, particularly with medications

          17   and injections.

          18   Q.     Is it fair to say, as part of your

          19   practice, you treat people with back and

          20   shoulder injuries?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Have you previously performed surgery

          23   on the back and shoulder?

          24   A.     Very much so, yes.

                                                           12



           1   Q.     As part of your practice, do you

           2   routinely review medical records, diagnostic

           3   studies and images?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     Does that include MRI studies?

           6   A.     It does, yes.

           7   Q.     To be clear, you're not a radiologist?

           8   A.     Correct, I'm not.

           9   Q.     But you rely and on read MRI studies

          10   as part of your treatment and practice of

          11   your patients?

          12   A.     Absolutely.  I've taken courses to

          13   learn how to interpret, but I'm not the

          14   person who puts out the report that has to do

          15   with the study itself.

          16          I certainly have to be able to discern

          17   the morphology, which means what's on that

          18   study and what significance it has to the

          19   person that has the study done for whatever

          20   reason, particularly injuries that are

          21   sustained.

          22   Q.     Is it fair to say that you prescribe

          23   these studies for your own patients?

          24   A.     Sure, all the time, yes.

           1   Q.     As part of your practice, do you

           2   physically examine patients?

           3   A.     Absolutely, yes.

           4   Q.     Routinely review records and reports

           5   from other specialists who may be treating

           6   your patients to help you develop your

           7   diagnosis and prognosis?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Is it fair to say you routinely make

          10   recommendations for additional or future

          11   treatments or procedures?

          12   A.     Yes, most of the time, that's true.

          13   Q.     In the litigation context, do you

          14   routinely review medical billing records?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     Have you previously been qualified as

          17   an expert witness in the Philadelphia Court

          18   of Common Pleas?

          19   A.     Yes, I have.

          20   Q.     Have you testified as an expert

          21   witness of orthopedic medicine and pain

          22   management in the Philadelphia Court of

          23   Common Pleas?

          24   A.     Yes, I have.

           1   Q.     Do you take away time from your usual

           2   practice to evaluate patients and review

           3   their records for people like Fr. Mularczyk,

           4   who's involved in litigation?

           5   A.     I do, yes.

           6   Q.     That's what you did in this case?

           7   A.     I did, yes.

           8               MS. MCCARTHY:  At this time, I

           9   offer Dr. Yarus as a medical expert in

          10   orthopedic medicine and pain management.

          14   BY MR. RONG:

          15   Q.     Dr. Yarus, my name is Matthew Rong,

          16   and I represent the City of Philadelphia in

          17   this matter.  I have a couple questions to

          18   follow up regarding your qualifications.

          19          Doctor, you're not board certified by

          20   the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery; is

          21   that correct?

          22   A.     If you're referring to the MD version,

          23   that's correct.

          24   Q.     As you stated, you have not performed

                                                           15



           1   orthopedic surgery since 2013; is that

           2   correct?

           3   A.     That's correct, yes.

           4   Q.     You presently cannot perform

           5   orthopedic surgeries because you do not have

           6   any privileges at any medical institutions;

           7   is that correct?

           8   A.     Right.  I would have to reapply and go

           9   through that whole process again, so yes,

          10   that's true.

          11   Q.     Just so the jury understands, you

          12   cannot perform surgeries to either the

          13   shoulders or back currently; is that correct?

          14   A.     Right.  I couldn't go into an

          15   operating room in a hospital setting because

          16   I don't have any privileges.  I gave those

          17   up.

          18   Q.     Doctor, if any of your own patients

          19   needed a shoulder or back surgery, you would

          20   have to send them to another orthopedic

          21   surgeon?

          22   A.     I would refer them, if it would be

          23   necessary for them to have the surgery, yes.

          24   Q.     Doctor, you have not published any

                                                           16



           1   peer-reviewed medical literature; is that

           2   correct?

           3   A.     Not as a treating physician, that's

           4   correct.

           5   Q.     You haven't taught any medical

           6   students or residents formally since 1994,

           7   correct?

           8   A.     That's fair, yes.

           9   Q.     You are not a neurologist?

          10   A.     Correct.

          11   Q.     You're not a neuroradiologist?

          12   A.     That is also correct.

          13   Q.     Doctor, you have not had any training

          14   in human factors; is that correct?

          15   A.     I missed the last part, I'm sorry.

          16   Q.     The specific area of training, have

          17   you had any training in human factors?

          18   A.     I'm not sure what human factors are.

          19   Q.     Human factors tends to be related to

          20   accident reconstruction, having to do with

          21   the body mechanisms.

          22   A.     I have a forensic certificate, but I'm

          23   not a reconstructionist or someone who would

          24   be involved in that process.  I have

                                                           17



           1   experience as a chief deputy coroner for 12

           2   years, and I used my forensic training in

           3   that area but certainly not in

           4   accident-related reconstruction.  That's

           5   true.

           6               MR. RONG:  Thank you, Doctor.

           7               THE WITNESS:  You're welcome

           8   thanks.  I never heard it termed that way, so

           9   sorry I didn't know what you were talking

          10   about.

          14   BY MS. MCCARTHY:

          15   Q.     Dr. Yarus, I'd like to just pick up on

          16   what you were talking about very briefly

          17   going back to your qualifications.

          18          You said you were a coroner?

          19   A.     I was the chief deputy coroner in

          20   Lebanon County for 12 years.

          21   Q.     Can you tell us a little bit about

          22   that.

          23   A.     It entails mostly going out on scenes

          24   and unfortunately pronouncing individuals

                                                           18



           1   deceased.  That was one part of it, but the

           2   other part is a lot of times we'll find bones

           3   or artifacts that are placed in very

           4   interesting areas.  We have to discern if

           5   they're animal or human, and I have training

           6   to do that.

           7          Also, on the scenes, we have to

           8   determine whether there is a crime along with

           9   the detectives who are out on the scene when

          10   there is a gunshot wound and those kinds of

          11   findings.

          12          All of that comes under forensics, and

          13   we rely on forensic pathologists to do the

          14   ultimate evaluation of the individual in

          15   their lab.  I don't do that as a forensic

          16   specialist, but that's the extent of my

          17   forensics only having to do with medicine,

          18   per se.

          19               MS. MCCARTHY:  Thank you.  Again,

          20   at this time, I'd offer Dr. Yarus as a

          21   medical expert in orthopedic medicine and

          22   pain management.

           3   Q.     Just one follow-up question, Doctor.

           4   I want to clarify.

           5          Fr. Mularczyk did not pass away in

           6   this accident; is that correct?

           7   A.     He did not.  He was alive and well

           8   when I saw him in April 2019.

          12   BY MS. MCCARTHY:

          13   Q.     Dr. Yarus, we're here to take your

          14   testimony on behalf of Fr. Mularczyk related

          15   to his injuries and treatment following the

          16   accident that occurred on April 19, 2018,

          17   correct?

          18   A.     Yes, that's correct.

          19   Q.     During your testimony, I'm going to

          20   ask you for some opinions.

          21          Can we agree that any opinion you give

          22   today will be within a reasonable degree of

          23   medical certainty?

          24   A.     Yes.

                                                           20



           1   Q.     On April 25, 2019, you evaluated

           2   Fr. Mularczyk at the request of my office,

           3   correct?

           4   A.     I did, yes.

           5   Q.     In addition, you reviewed his medical

           6   records related to this accident?

           7   A.     Yes, I did.

           8   Q.     After your examination and review of

           9   the records, you produced reports that

          10   contained your opinions concerning this

          11   matter?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     Can you please look at the documents

          14   that have been marked as Yarus-2 and -3

          15   respectively.

          16   A.     Okay.

          17   Q.     Are those your reports?

          18   A.     They are, yes.

          19   Q.     During the course of your testimony

          20   today, I'm going to ask you to refer to your

          21   reports as needed; is that fair?

          22   A.     Yes, I will do that.

          23   Q.     In a moment, I'm going to ask you to

          24   walk the jury through your physical

                                                           21



           1   examination and evaluation of Fr. Mularczyk

           2   and his records step by step.

           3          But before I do that, can you explain

           4   to the jury what injuries, if any,

           5   Fr. Mularczyk sustained as a result of the

           6   April 19, 2018 accident?

           7               MR. RONG:  Off the record.

           8               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is

           9   3:52.  Off the video record.

          11               (Whereupon, a discussion was held

          12    off the videotaped record.)

          13                       - - -

          14               MR. RONG:  I'm laying an

          15   objection on the record.  First, the general

          16   comment I'd like to make is this objection is

          17   being made because counsel made a similar

          18   objection at the time of Dr. Fras'

          19   deposition, his trial deposition.

          20               I believe it to be a frivolous

          21   objection.  However, I wanted to reserve my

          22   right to argue it in this context, if

          23   necessary.

          24               The objection being that, given

                                                           22



           1   that the doctor has conceded that he is not

           2   an accident reconstructionist, that he cannot

           3   render a conclusion as to what injuries were

           4   sustained during this accident because that

           5   would require his ability to understand how

           6   the body would operate or change or be

           7   affected in a fall or whatever Mr. Mularczyk

           8   is claiming happened as a mechanism in his

           9   accident.

          10               That is an objection I'm only

          11   placing on the record to reserve the right to

          12   argue it.  However, I believe that the

          13   objection that was made at Dr. Fras'

          14   deposition was a frivolous objection.

          15               MS. MCCARTHY:  Before we got

          16   started today, counsel gave me the

          17   professional courtesy of a heads-up, which

          18   was greatly appreciated, but I believe

          19   Dr. Yarus is more than qualified to discuss

          20   what injuries were sustained as a result of

          21   Fr. Mularczyk's accident on April 19, 2018.

          22   He's already gone through his qualifications,

          23   which are more than adequate.

          24               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  3:55.

           1               Back on the record.

           2               THE WITNESS:  Fr. Mularczyk

           3   injured two areas of the body.  One is the

           4   low back.  We call that the lumbar spine.

           5   The other is the right shoulder.

           6               I broke down the types of

           7   injuries that were sustained into soft tissue

           8   injuries.  Then we'll talk about the discs in

           9   relation to the nerves that come out and

          10   supply motor and sensory functions.

          11               For the low back, he had a strain

          12   and sprain; a term I use, lumbar myositis,

          13   which is a covering of the muscles, which was

          14   inflamed.  I actually used an osteopathic

          15   term, that is somatic dysfunction.  It just

          16   means that, because the muscles, tendons, and

          17   ligaments are injured, the motion and

          18   function of the lumbar spine becomes altered.

          19               I also used a term called

          20   enthesopathy.  The enthesis -- and I'll show

          21   this on a model in a couple seconds here --

          22   is the area of bone in the spine where these

          23   ligaments and tendons attach so that we can

          24   get motion and stability of the spine.

                                                           24



           1               Going to the discs, at L3-4 and

           2   L4-5 -- we designate the levels by two

           3   vertebrae and the disc is in the middle --

           4   those had protrusions.  At 4-5, there was

           5   sequestration of the disc fragment that was

           6   going caudally to the left of the midline

           7   with encroachment.

           8               Breaking down all those terms,

           9   basically the disc came out of its

          10   containment area.  If we think about a jelly

          11   doughnut, putting pressure on the doughnut

          12   and the jelly coming out, this jelly actually

          13   goes away from the doughnut and it starts to

          14   go toward the top part of the vertebral body,

          15   which is called -- I'm sorry, caudad is

          16   lower; it goes down below.  Cephalad would be

          17   the upper.  Caudad is low, my apologies.

          18               Anyway, the disc went down away

          19   from the level where it would usually be

          20   situated.  At L5-S1, there was also a

          21   protrusion, as well.  This was going to the

          22   left.

          23               All these discs from 3-4, 5-S1,

          24   which stands for sacrum, that's the next bone

                                                           25



           1   below the last vertebrae in the spinal

           2   column, they were going left.

           3               The radiculopathy on the left

           4   comes from pressure on the nerve from the

           5   discs.  This was identified clinically at

           6   L4-5 and L5-S1 by my examination.

           7               In regard to the right shoulder,

           8   there was a contusion.  Then there was an MRI

           9   that was done, and it showed one of the four

          10   tendons of the rotator cuff to be torn.

          11   That's called the supraspinatus.

          12               Lastly, I said that Fr. Mularczyk

          13   had chronic pain secondary to the incident of

          14   April 19, 2018 and also a decrease in the

          15   activities in which he participated secondary

          16   to that incident, as well.

          17   BY MS. MCCARTHY:

          18   Q.     Do you have an opinion within a

          19   reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

          20   whether any of these injuries are serious?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Which ones?

          23   A.     I believe the disc injuries as well as

          24   the tear in the rotator cuff, supraspinatus

                                                           26



           1   tendon, to be the most serious.  The soft

           2   tissue injuries are certainly permanent in

           3   nature.  They're higher grade, but I will

           4   classify those below those injuries that are

           5   disc oriented and the shoulder injury

           6   involving the actual structure that's part of

           7   the cuff.

           8   Q.     Do you have an opinion within a

           9   reasonable degree of medical certainty

          10   whether any of these injuries that you just

          11   discussed pertaining to the accident that

          12   brings us here today are permanent?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Which ones?

          15   A.     Well, if we talk about soft tissue

          16   injuries, a lot of times sprains and strains

          17   and muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries

          18   will go away if they're low grade.  So we

          19   grade them up to a Roman numeral 4.  These

          20   are fours.  So what happens in the collagen

          21   fibers of the muscle particularly is it

          22   scars.  That's permanent.  It's not going to

          23   go away.

          24          In regard to the discs, the discs are

                                                           27



           1   out of their containment fibers.  They're

           2   pressing on the nerve, so that creates the

           3   radicular pain, the reproduction of that

           4   symptom and finding.

           5          Irrespective of what you do to correct

           6   that, even up to and including surgery, the

           7   effects of surgery are still there.  Some of

           8   the known effects of surgery, such as

           9   scarring particularly, will still be there,

          10   so it's permanent, as well.

          11          You may be able to help the person and

          12   improve their situation by doing it, but the

          13   effects are still there.  So I will classify

          14   that as permanent, as well.

          15   Q.     Let's talk about some of the terms

          16   that you used in discussing the injuries that

          17   Fr. Mularczyk received as a result of this

          18   subsequent.

          19          Let's start with the lumbar spine.

          20   A.     In order to understand what I was

          21   talking about, this is a representation of

          22   the lumbar spine.  It contains four vertebral

          23   bodies.  There is actually five in total, but

          24   the concept is that each vertebral body has a

                                                           28



           1   disc in between.  We'll number them 4, 5, et

           2   cetera.

           3          What happens with the disc is that

           4   it's surrounded by containment fibers.  I

           5   mentioned that.  They're called annular

           6   fibers.  They have nerves in them, and they

           7   will send the signals that there is pain.

           8          When the disc comes out, this is what

           9   it looks like, and the nerves are right

          10   behind that supply motor and sensory

          11   functions to the extremities.  If disc is

          12   coming out at one level or more than one

          13   level, it will have an affect of the

          14   extremities at various levels, particularly

          15   for the sensory component of the nerve that

          16   supplies that function.  That's the front

          17   part of the person.

          18          As we keep turning, we see holes where

          19   these nerves come out.  At each level on the

          20   right and left, the main nerves -- I'll call

          21   them main nerves because there's other nerves

          22   we're going to talk about -- they come out

          23   and supply that sensory and motor function.

          24          As we keep turning, we're now at the

                                                           29



           1   back of the person.  This is the bone you can

           2   feel at the center of your back and all the

           3   way up to your neck.  This is true of the

           4   whole spinal column.

           5          There are motion segments here.  I'm

           6   putting the needle in the left side.  This

           7   will be the right side for that level.  These

           8   are called facets.  They are actually joints.

           9   This is where motion occurs.

          10          I mentioned the enthesis or

          11   enthesopathy, where I'm putting the needles

          12   where the ligaments attach, another smaller

          13   structure that help move the spine at these

          14   areas.

          15          One other thing to mention because

          16   we're going to talk about treatment, there

          17   are small nerves, where I'm putting the

          18   needle, situated under the facets.  These are

          19   called medial branch nerves.  They're the

          20   nerves that send the pain signal to the brain

          21   when there is injury at these levels.  We can

          22   knock out those nerves by burning them.  The

          23   reason we can do that -- not the main nerves,

          24   but these little nerves -- is because they

                                                           30



           1   will regenerate or come back.

           2          We can give the person pain relief by

           3   doing that particular procedure, which is

           4   called a rhizotomy or ablation.  That's the

           5   anatomy of the low back.

           6   Q.     Can you explain to us -- you used the

           7   word protrusion, I believe?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     What is a protrusion?

          10   A.     There are three faces of disc that can

          11   come out of the containment fibers.  The

          12   first is a bulge.  Sometimes bulging is

          13   normal because the disc is designed to absorb

          14   forces, but when it comes out, that's the

          15   first type.  I have a model for that one,

          16   too.

          17          What it looks like is basically just

          18   coming out a little bit.  The next phase

          19   would be a protrusion, which is what we're

          20   talking about here for Fr. Mularczyk, and

          21   then a herniation, which is totally a disc

          22   that's out.

          23          Fr. Mularczyk has a disc that actually

          24   came out and then went downward as far as

                                                           31



           1   where it ended up being situated.  Once that

           2   disc comes out, the nerve is right there, and

           3   when it sits up on a nerve or compresses it,

           4   that's when you get radicular symptoms.

           5          When we talk about radiculopathy, it's

           6   coming from this mechanical phenomena of the

           7   disc itself sitting up on the nerve, as I

           8   like to say.  The correct term is compression

           9   of the nerve.

          10   Q.     Is a disc protrusion a normal

          11   condition?

          12   A.     It is not.

          13   Q.     Is a protrusion a painful condition?

          14   A.     It definitely is, yes.

          15   Q.     You just used the term radiculopathy?

          16   A.     Right.

          17   Q.     Can you please explain exactly what

          18   radiculopathy is.

          19   A.     Radiculopathy is a person complaining

          20   of radiating symptoms in an extremity; in

          21   this case, the lower extremities.  That comes

          22   from the disc sitting up on the nerve.  Once

          23   the nerve is compressed, it doesn't fire

          24   correctly.

                                                           32



           1          When I examined Fr. Mularczyk, he had

           2   reproduction of radiating symptoms, so I gave

           3   clinical diagnosis.  We don't have any

           4   testing to show that.  There is electrical

           5   evaluation that can be done.  But clinically,

           6   you can also tell radiculopathy is there by

           7   reproducing those symptom.

           8   Q.     Is radiculopathy a normal condition?

           9   A.     It is not.

          10   Q.     Is it a painful condition?

          11   A.     It definitely is.

          12   Q.     Can you explain to us the shoulder

          13   injury that Fr. Mularczyk received as a

          14   result of the accident?

          15   A.     Yeah, I can.  This is a representation

          16   of a right shoulder.  We're talking about the

          17   right for Fr. Mularczyk.  What I'm showing

          18   here is the bone that we call the humerus.

          19   This is the square bone you can feel on the

          20   outside of your shoulder.  This comes off of

          21   the wing bone, that's the scapula.

          22          That particular part of it that we can

          23   feel here is the acromion.  The acromion is

          24   acutely related to the collar bone or the

                                                           33



           1   clavicle.  There are ligaments that span

           2   those two bones to stabilize them, all these

           3   three ligaments here.

           4          This is the first tendon of the

           5   rotator cuff that attaches into the outside

           6   of the humerus bone.  That's called the

           7   supraspinatus.  There is three others in the

           8   whole cuff.  It spells the words, sits, SITS.

           9          This is the one that Fr. Mularczyk had

          10   a tear in from the incident, and this is the

          11   one that's most typically torn.  It sits

          12   right underneath that square bone.  As the

          13   shoulder moves upward, when there is a tear,

          14   it's going to cause pain because it's going

          15   to get crimped between the head of the bone

          16   of the humerus and the undersurface of the

          17   acromion.

          18   Q.     How do the back injuries that

          19   Fr. Mularczyk suffered as a result of the

          20   accident affect his day-to-day activities?

          21   A.     They're going to diminish the

          22   activities.  That was the last part of my

          23   conclusions; that he had a diminution or

          24   decrease in his ability to function, not only

                                                           34



           1   the low back, but from the shoulder itself.

           2          When you're doing activities when you

           3   have these injuries, it's going to slow you

           4   down.  It's going to cause pain, and you're

           5   not going to be able to function the way you

           6   normally do.

           7   Q.     Do you have an opinion as to the

           8   permanency?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     What is that?

          11   A.     These have permanency to them.  That

          12   word means that it affects the individual's

          13   ability to function in their lifestyle,

          14   whatever it may be.  When it hinders or

          15   diminishes, we call that permanency.

          16   Q.     How about the shoulder, how do the

          17   injuries he received as a result of the

          18   accident to his shoulder affect his

          19   day-to-day?

          20   A.     Well, the ability to reach, maneuver

          21   in the motions of the shoulder, which are

          22   forward, backward, internal/external

          23   rotation, circumduction, like you're going to

          24   throw a ball, reaching back, those types of

                                                           35



           1   things, putting your clothing on, a coat or

           2   shirt.

           3          All of these things that we do that a

           4   lot of us take for granted, I do too, become

           5   difficult because those motions create pain

           6   for the reason I showed on the model.

           7   Q.     Do you have an opinion as to the

           8   permanency of that condition?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     What is it?

          11   A.     This is a term again that applies to

          12   Fr. Mularczyk not being able to function

          13   normally using the shoulder girdle, that

          14   particular area that we showed.  It is a

          15   difficult issue with activities, and that

          16   becomes a permanent issue.

          17   Q.     I'd like to get into your examination

          18   and history of Fr. Mularczyk.

          19               MR. RONG:  Off the record.

           2               MR. RONG:  This is in the same

           3   vein as the prior objection that was made.

           4               There was an objection made by

           5   plaintiff's counsel during Dr. Fras'

           6   deposition regarding anything that was said

           7   by the plaintiff to Dr. Fras regarding

           8   history related to this accident and his

           9   treatment.

          10               I believe that to be a frivolous

          11   objection.  However, similar to the prior

          12   objection, I'm just reserving the right to

          13   argue that objection in this context in

          14   Dr. Yarus' deposition if this is something we

          15   agree to proceed at the time of trial.

          16               MS. MCCARTHY:  To that, Dr. Yarus

          17   testified during his qualifications that

          18   taking a history is part of what he does as

          19   part of his normal everyday practice in

          20   treating and evaluating patients.

          23   BY MS. MCCARTHY:

          24   Q.     Dr. Yarus, when you examined

                                                           37



           1   Fr. Mularczyk, did you ask about the accident

           2   of April 19, 2018?

           3   A.     I did, yes.

           4   Q.     What did he tell you?

           5   A.     His complaints were right shoulder

           6   pain and low back pain.  Then he told me that

           7   he drove over a pothole and the tire

           8   exploded.  He had to change the tire, and

           9   when he was doing so, the tire fell on top of

          10   him.  He described himself as being slammed

          11   and pinned by the tire.

          12          We then discussed the treatment that

          13   he had at Spinal Care and Progress Physical

          14   Therapy, the injections that Dr. Levinstein

          15   provided.

          16          When he presented, he was using a

          17   cane.  He did tell me that the injections

          18   helped somewhat.  He had had pain in the

          19   shoulder that was still present.  Then I

          20   asked him particularly how he was feeling,

          21   and he told me that his pain level was 6 out

          22   of 10 on what we call the analog scale.  That

          23   includes the low back and the right shoulder.

          24          The pain was at its worst then.  When

                                                           38



           1   resting or not performing activities, 1 to 2

           2   out of 10.  He had radiating pain to both

           3   lower extremities.  That's the radicular

           4   component we were talking about.  And he had

           5   headache and fatigue.

           6          He had actually undergone surgery for

           7   the right shoulder, and he said that had

           8   helped him, as well.

           9   Q.     When you saw him, he was still having

          10   pain from the accident?

          11   A.     He still was, yes.

          12   Q.     Did you ask Fr. Mularczyk about his

          13   medical history prior to this accident?

          14   A.     I did, yes.

          15   Q.     What did he tell you?

          16   A.     Well, as far as medication, he was

          17   taking ibuprofen 600 milligrams, surgical

          18   history included the right shoulder.  Then I

          19   asked him about preexisting conditions.  This

          20   is a section in the history taking where we

          21   want to find out if there is any prior

          22   injuries or issues with the same areas.

          23          He did have the two prior low back

          24   issues; one in 2010 without injury.  2012 he

                                                           39



           1   had spinal stenosis, which is a term that

           2   just means arthritis, and that was causing

           3   difficulty for him, and he had surgery for

           4   that, which improved him.

           5          He said he had minimal residuals up to

           6   and including the incident of April 19, 2019.

           7   That means that he wasn't completely

           8   recovered, but he didn't have the same kind

           9   of symptoms that he experienced after this

          10   incident occurred.

          11   Q.     You examined Fr. Mularczyk?

          12   A.     I did, yes.

          13   Q.     Can you walk the jury through your

          14   examination.

          15   A.     Yes.  I did a complete full exam, but

          16   I'll stick to the areas of chief complaint.

          17          He was 6-foot-2-inches tall, 240

          18   pounds.  From the low back, he had a loss of

          19   lordosis.  This is a manifestation of what

          20   happens when muscles, tendons, and ligaments

          21   and those soft tissues are injured.  The

          22   natural curve that we see in the low back

          23   becomes flattened.  I observed that.

          24          In touching the muscles, he had

                                                           40



           1   hypertonicity from L3-4 to L5-S1.  Left

           2   greater than right.  I did what's called a

           3   sitting root and straight leg raising sign.

           4   There is various degrees of raising in terms

           5   of looking at the number of degrees.

           6          His left showed 15 and 15.  Right was

           7   positive as well at 20 and 25 degrees.  That

           8   just means, when I lifted, he had

           9   reproduction of his root signs.  That's where

          10   I got the radiculopathy diagnosis from.

          11          His motion of the spine was 40 percent

          12   of normal, and that includes going forward,

          13   backward, side to side, and rotating.  There

          14   were no cord signs.  We call those long-tract

          15   signs.  Those were not evident, so his spinal

          16   cord was fine.  The vasculature in his

          17   extremities was okay, so we didn't have any

          18   issues there.

          19          The next thing I did is reflex

          20   testing.  This is the most important thing as

          21   far as examination because when there is

          22   abnormality, as there was here, it reflects

          23   back up to the spine.  By that I mean those

          24   levels that I showed, those nerves that come

                                                           41



           1   out, those are the ones that will show me or

           2   anybody doing this test whether or not there

           3   is a particular problem at a particular

           4   level.

           5          We do the kneecap reflexes, and those

           6   were okay, so that covers L3-4.  Then we did

           7   the extensor hallucis.  There is no tap

           8   reflex for L4-5, so we ask the person to lift

           9   the great toe.  There was a left deficit 4

          10   out of 5.  The right was okay at 5 out of 5.

          11          The last one we do is the Achilles

          12   reflex.  That reflects to L5-S1.  The right

          13   was 2 out of 3, that's abnormal.  The left

          14   was 1 out of 3.

          15          Next, I test that sensory component of

          16   the radiculopathy by doing pinpricking down

          17   along the back all the way down the

          18   extremity.  There are bands that will

          19   correspond to the level.  When there is a

          20   deficit or the person tells me they can't

          21   feel it as well as they did upper or lower or

          22   side to side, comparing right or left, it's

          23   abnormal.  For Fr. Mularczyk, it was abnormal

          24   on the left at L4-5; abnormal at L5-S1 for

                                                           42



           1   both the right and left.

           2          Next, I did the extremity examination.

           3   No edema.  No other abnormalities or painful

           4   masses.  Neck area was okay.  He had had

           5   surgery for the shoulder, so I would say that

           6   the shoulder was improved after that.

           7   Q.     That was a lot of information.

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     What were your findings based on your

          10   physical examination?

          11   A.     For the low back particularly, because

          12   that was the focus here, there is

          13   abnormalities on a lot of levels.  When we

          14   look at the soft tissue.  That was abnormal.

          15   That corresponds to my diagnosis for that

          16   area in the low back.

          17          Then the motion was deficient, so that

          18   comes along again with the soft tissue

          19   injury.  Looking at the reflexes, those are

          20   abnormal.  I said they're the most important

          21   because when you have protrusions, going back

          22   to that explanation and discussion, those

          23   protrusions are discs sitting up on the

          24   nerves.  The nerves become affected, and then

                                                           43



           1   we have abnormal reflexes as a result of

           2   that.

           3          That's what I was talking about when I

           4   gave those numbers 1 out of 3, 2 out of 3.

           5   And looking at and extensor hallucis, the

           6   great toe lift, on a 5 scale that was 4 out

           7   of 5 on the left.  That's why that came

           8   about.

           9   Q.     These are all permanent impairments?

          10   A.     They are, yes.

          11   Q.     You also reviewed records in

          12   formulating your diagnosis, correct?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     Can you walk us through your records

          15   you reviewed.

          16               MR. RONG:  Off the record.

          17               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Time is 4:18.

          18   Off the video record.

          19                       - - -

          20               (Whereupon, a discussion was held

          21    off the videotaped record.)

          22                       - - -

          23               MR. RONG:  Similar objection

          24   preempting some testimony that I expect to

                                                           44



           1   happen.  I expect the doctor is going to

           2   testify regarding the review of radiology

           3   films and reports.  This is in the same vein.

           4               Again, there were objections that

           5   were made during Dr. Fras' deposition

           6   regarding the validity or his ability to

           7   testify regarding what's seen on film or even

           8   just in reports.  I'm going to make that same

           9   objection in this deposition.

          10               Again, I believe it to be a

          11   frivolous objection.  I believe that, based

          12   upon both experts having testified that they

          13   regularly use radiology exams in the course

          14   of their treatment, that they are both

          15   permitted to testify to this.

          16               However, if plaintiff's counsel,

          17   at the time of trial, is going to insist on

          18   this objection regarding Dr. Fras' ability to

          19   testify to anything that he reviewed in these

          20   reports or films, I'm similarly reserving the

          21   right to make this objection in the context

          22   of Dr. Yarus' deposition.

          23               MS. MCCARTHY:  To that end, as

          24   part of his qualifications, Dr. Yarus

                                                           45



           1   testified to the fact he regularly relies on

           2   films and MRIs in diagnosing his patients.

           3   While he's not a radiologist, he's trained to

           4   review those studies.

           5               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  4:19.

           6               Back on the video record.

           7               THE WITNESS:  I had actual hard

           8   copy studies on a disc that included the

           9   right shoulder and low back, the lumbar

          10   spine.  I was able to visualize the study.

          11               I'll tell you that what the

          12   radiologist read was pretty accurate as far

          13   as my interpretation on my own.  I agreed

          14   pretty much with what was seen as abnormal,

          15   particularly on both of those studies.

          16               For the right shoulder, an actual

          17   tear in the supraspinatus tendon, which was

          18   partial thickness.  No evidence of

          19   inflammation in the bursal sacs that are

          20   situated between the bones.  The glenoid

          21   labrum, which is a lip that surrounds the

          22   socket where the head rides, that was okay.

          23   The biceps tendon was okay.  Some arthritic

          24   changes in the AC joint.  We see that all the

                                                           46



           1   time.  That wasn't an issue for

           2   Fr. Mularczyk.  It was just an incidental

           3   finding.

           4               For the low back, just to make it

           5   simple, the three discs that were protruding

           6   that I saw and one other one that the

           7   radiologist indicated; L2-3 showed a

           8   protrusion on the left.  I don't think that's

           9   an issue clinically.  I'll acknowledge that

          10   it's there, but I don't think it's causing

          11   the symptomatology that the other three are.

          12   I agreed there, and basically those discs are

          13   going to the left.

          14               I had the records of Spinal Care,

          15   Progress Physical Therapy, Dr. Levinstein's

          16   practice is PA Pain Practice, so I had his

          17   records for the injections, particularly Penn

          18   Medicine medical records, and then the

          19   billing and invoicing on an open item ledger

          20   and the actual Pennsylvania Pain Specialist

          21   invoicing that was provided.

          22   Q.     Describe what, if anything, you

          23   learned of significance in reviewing these

          24   records.

                                                           47



           1   A.     I think the records are clear in that

           2   Fr. Mularczyk had these injuries born out of

           3   this incident of April 19, 2018.  Those

           4   injuries were addressed with conservative

           5   care, interventional technique by

           6   Dr. Levinstein on two occasions.

           7          He did epidural injections, I believe,

           8   August 6th and 20th of 2018, then just

           9   confirmation looking through the studies that

          10   there were injuries in those areas that we

          11   described.

          12   Q.     Can you briefly explain to the jury

          13   what an MRI is.

          14   A.     MRI stands for magnetic resonance

          15   imaging.  It's a sophisticated piece of

          16   equipment that has a large magnet.  It

          17   rotates at super rapid speed.  When that

          18   happens, the plus and minus that you see on

          19   the magnet becomes blurred essentially, and

          20   it reorganizes protons in the body.  A

          21   computer is hooked up to the magnet that will

          22   interpret whatever anatomy you're

          23   visualizing, and it will put it out in two

          24   forms, T1 and T2.

                                                           48



           1          We're able to see bone windows, and

           2   we're able to see the soft tissue structures;

           3   in this case, discs in reference to nerves.

           4   In the shoulder, we're able to see the

           5   anatomy that is made up of the cuff, the

           6   labrum and the bone components as well and

           7   anything that's wrong or not right, such as

           8   loose bodies or tumors, things of that

           9   nature.  We can discern that.

          10          Fr. Mularczyk does not have any

          11   tumors, just to be clear.  It's just as a way

          12   of describing what this sophisticated test

          13   can do as far as giving us the visualization

          14   of the anatomy.

          15   Q.     I'm going to show you what we've had

          16   marked as Yarus-4 for identification.

          17          Doctor, do you recognize that

          18   document?

          19   A.     I do, yes.

          20   Q.     What is it?

          21   A.     This is a document that was created by

          22   Dr. Rosin, who saw Fr. Mularczyk on August

          23   10, 2018, so he generated a report for that

          24   visit.

                                                           49



           1   Q.     Is this some of the medical

           2   documentation that you relied on?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     Dr. Rosin linked the car accident to

           5   the injury sustained by Fr. Mularczyk?

           6   A.     Correct.

           7   Q.     He did that within a reasonable degree

           8   of medical certainty?

           9   A.     Yes, he did.

          10   Q.     After reviewing the medical records,

          11   diagnostic studies, and examining

          12   Fr. Mularczyk, did you form a prognosis?

          13   A.     Yes, I did.

          14   Q.     What was that prognosis?

          15   A.     I gave him a guarded prognosis.  The

          16   reason for that terminology is that there is

          17   still items that will be affected for

          18   Fr. Mularczyk to consider as far as

          19   treatment.

          20   Q.     Can you briefly explain what a

          21   prognosis is.

          22   A.     Prognosis is a term that will drive

          23   future indications for treatment for an

          24   individual.  It takes a lot into

                                                           50



           1   consideration; all about the individual

           2   including financial issues, what they're

           3   capable of doing and what responses from a

           4   statistical standpoint and statistical

           5   analysis standpoint we know will be effective

           6   from just those specific injuries.  There is

           7   a litany of information at our disposal that

           8   leads us to be able to do that.

           9   Q.     You briefly touched on why you thought

          10   he had a guarded prognosis.  Could you flesh

          11   that out for us a little bit more.

          12   A.     We're still going to make

          13   recommendations in the guarded phase as

          14   opposed to variable, poor, good even.

          15          In this phase, we know that making

          16   recommendations for treatment is going to be

          17   effective statistically for the individual.

          18   That's all we're looking at when we see this

          19   particular term used.

          20   Q.     Based on your diagnosis, prognosis,

          21   examination of Fr. Mularczyk and review of

          22   the records, do you have an opinion as to

          23   whether or not Fr. Mularczyk will require

          24   future treatment for the injuries suffered as

                                                           51



           1   a result of the accident that brings us here

           2   today?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     What is that opinion?

           5   A.     That he will need future treatment.

           6   Q.     What recommendations did you make

           7   about his future medical treatment?

           8   A.     I talked about interventional care for

           9   the low back, and that includes the burning

          10   of the small nerves that knocks out the pain.

          11   Certainly, there are epidurals similar to

          12   what Dr. Levinstein did.  You can repeat

          13   those in a series of three at six-month

          14   intervals.  Lastly, operating on those areas

          15   where the discs are out, to take out the disc

          16   and relieve the nerve of its compression.

          17          For the shoulder, I talked about

          18   arthroscopy, which is a procedure that he had

          19   done.  Because these areas scar as a way of

          20   healing, you can't get back what was

          21   originally there.  It's not like the skin.

          22   If you cut skin, skin will repair itself,

          23   maybe with some help of suturing perhaps.

          24          But if you suture or you address the

                                                           52



           1   tear in the cuff, the only way the body has

           2   to heal it is by scar.  That's why I said

           3   it's a permanent injury.  You still have to

           4   go back in and clean it up, which will give

           5   the person better range of motion.

           6          I talked about therapy after any of

           7   these procedures are done.  That's for a

           8   short period of time.  I talked about various

           9   types of medications that can be used,

          10   including pain medication,

          11   anti-inflammatories.  There are more

          12   sophisticated medications that address the

          13   nerves.  Those are neurotransmitter

          14   modulators.  We can actually use

          15   anti-epileptics, which are effective.  And

          16   for the soft tissue injuries, we use creams

          17   that can be applied, as well.

          18   Q.     Dr. Yarus, why did you make these

          19   recommendations regarding future treatment

          20   for Fr. Mularczyk?

          21   A.     Fr. Mularczyk presented still having

          22   issues and pain and limitations from the

          23   incident that occurred April 19, 2018.  For

          24   that reason, these are still reasonable types

                                                           53



           1   of treatments that will enhance his ability

           2   to function.

           3   Q.     Dr. Yarus, I'm going to show you what

           4   we've had marked as Bala-2 for

           5   identification.

           6          Do you recognize this report?

           7   A.     I do, yes.

           8   Q.     It's a medical cost projection report?

           9   A.     Correct.

          10   Q.     To be clear, you did not author it?

          11   A.     It is not my work.  I did not author

          12   this document.

          13   Q.     I just want you to take a look at the

          14   chart contained in Bala-2, authored by Chava

          15   Goldschmidt and Nadene Taniguchi.

          16          Can you confirm that's the treatment

          17   that you recommended?

          18   A.     Yes.  In the summary of costs, the

          19   treatments are the ones that I designated.

          20   Q.     Thank you, Doctor.

          21          Dr. Yarus, do you have an opinion to a

          22   reasonable degree of medical certainty as to

          23   the cause of the injuries we've discussed

          24   throughout your testimony?

                                                           54



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     What is it?

           3   A.     The motor vehicle accident of April

           4   19, 2018 is the reason that Fr. Mularczyk

           5   sustained these injuries.

           6   Q.     Do you have an opinion to a reasonable

           7   degree of medical certainty as to the

           8   reasonableness, necessity, and relatedness of

           9   all the treatment that Fr. Mularczyk received

          10   following the accident?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     What is it?

          13   A.     I would characterize the care as being

          14   related to the incident, certainly medically

          15   necessary, reasonable, and the fees that were

          16   generated were usual and customary for the

          17   services provided.

          18   Q.     That would include the physical

          19   therapy, the surgery, and injections?

          20   A.     I would say yes.

          21   Q.     Do you have an opinion to a reasonable

          22   degree of medical certainty as to the

          23   permanency of injuries that Fr. Mularczyk

          24   received?

                                                           55



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     What is that?

           3   A.     There is certainly permanency to the

           4   injuries he received.

           5   Q.     Finally, Doctor, have all the opinions

           6   you've given today been to a reasonable

           7   degree of medical certainty?

           8   A.     Yes, they have.

           9               MS. MCCARTHY:  Your witness.

          12                       - - -

          13   BY MR. RONG:

          14   Q.     Doctor, just a few questions to follow

          15   up.

          16          To be clear, you saw Fr. Mularczyk on

          17   only one occasion, correct?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     To be more clear, he was not your

          20   patient, correct?

          21   A.     Correct.  I'm not his treating

          22   physician.

          23   Q.     The sole purpose of your meeting with

          24   Fr. Mularczyk was to draft a report for the

                                                           56



           1   purpose of this lawsuit, correct?

           2   A.     That's correct, yes.

           3   Q.     You did not prescribe him any

           4   medications after this visit, correct?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     He has no further appointments to see

           7   you again, correct?

           8   A.     Not that I'm aware of.  That's

           9   correct.

          10   Q.     You have no expectation that you will

          11   ever see him again, correct?

          12   A.     I would think not, but sometimes after

          13   procedures are done particularly, I may do an

          14   additional independent exam, but I don't

          15   foresee that.

          16   Q.     Doctor, either before or after your

          17   one-time examination of him, you never spoke

          18   to any of his treating or primary care

          19   doctors, correct?

          20   A.     That's correct.

          21   Q.     Doctor, this is not the first time you

          22   have examined a person involved in a lawsuit

          23   for the Simon firm, correct?

          24   A.     You're correct, yes.

                                                           57



           1   Q.     In fact, you've examined probably

           2   hundreds of litigants for the Simon firm,

           3   correct?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     Doctor, when you examine claimants for

           6   the Simon firm, how much do you charge for

           7   the exam?

           8   A.     Usually, the exam, which encompasses

           9   review of the records, the time spent with

          10   the individual, the time spent dictating,

          11   what it costs to get the dictation back in

          12   the form of the report is $500.

          13   Q.     Doctor, between 2014 and 2019, the

          14   Simon firm has paid your practice close to $2

          15   million; is that correct?

          16   A.     That's fair, yes.

          17   Q.     Doctor, just so the jury is clear,

          18   you're paid another fee in addition to the

          19   exam fee when you give trial testimony, like

          20   you're doing today, correct?

          21   A.     For the time and testimony, yes.

          22   Q.     How much are you being paid for your

          23   time today?

          24   A.     The fee is $3,200.

           1   Q.     Doctor, the jurors are going to hear

           2   that the city's expert Dr. Fras is charging

           3   the city just under $5,000 for his time to

           4   take testimony.

           5          Are you charging less for your

           6   testimony because you have a special

           7   arrangement with the Simon firm?

          15               MS. MCCARTHY:  What he charges, I

          16   mean, that's up to him.  The insinuation that

          17   he's -- I need to calm down for a minute.

          18               It's an improper insinuation.

          19   The fact that you use a more expensive doctor

          20   doesn't mean that Dr. Yarus is doing anything

          21   underhanded.

          22               MR. RONG:  My response to that

          23   is, actually, that's not the insinuation.

          24   The follow-up question that I'll preempt for

                                                           59



           1   you is that I'm going to ask him why, given

           2   similar qualifications, he's not charging

           3   $5,000.

           4               MS. MCCARTHY:  If he ups his

           5   price because of this, you're going to have

           6   to pay the difference.  Don't get any ideas.

           7               THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  4:33.

           8               Back on the video record.

           9               THE WITNESS:  To answer the

          10   question, the fee is predicated on what I

          11   would be doing if I wasn't here testifying,

          12   as far as my time.

          13               At this point in the day, I'd be

          14   doing interventional techniques.  We base the

          15   fees on exactly that fee that I would

          16   generate for as many people as I would see in

          17   an hour, who would receive injections.

          18   That's the fee I've come up with.  No other

          19   reason other than that.

          20               It certainly doesn't move me one

          21   way or the other when I'm looking at a case.

          22   It just comes from that particular aspect of

          23   my practice.

          24   BY MR. RONG:

                                                           60



           1   Q.     Now, Doctor, going back to your

           2   meeting with Fr. Mularczyk, he told you about

           3   the accident and his injuries, correct?

           4   A.     He did, yes.

           5   Q.     He told you that he was injured while

           6   changing his tire when the tire fell on top

           7   of him, slammed and pinned him, correct?

           8   A.     He did, yes.

           9   Q.     He also told you that presently his

          10   pain comes and goes, and that it is usually a

          11   1 or 2 out of 10 when not performing

          12   activities, correct?

          13   A.     That's correct.

          14   Q.     He also told you he never missed any

          15   time from work and is still working the same

          16   job, correct?

          17   A.     He is, yes.

          18   Q.     He also told you that he had a back

          19   condition that required him to have back

          20   surgery in 2012, correct?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Doctor, would you agree with me that

          23   you have not reviewed any MRI films related

          24   to his lower back prior to this injury?

                                                           61



           1   A.     Correct.

           2   Q.     Doctor, is it fair to say that you

           3   wouldn't know what levels of his lumbar spine

           4   were affected by that back condition which

           5   required him to have surgery?

           6   A.     Correct.

           7   Q.     Would you agree with me, Doctor, that

           8   nowhere in your report do you differentiate

           9   which of these levels -- as far as the

          10   abnormalities that you've testified to

          11   regarding protrusions and herniations, would

          12   you agree that nowhere in your report do you

          13   differentiate which of these levels and

          14   findings would be attributable to the 2012

          15   condition as opposed to this accident?

          16   A.     I would say that you're correct in

          17   that I didn't differentiate.  I assigned

          18   those findings at L3-4 through L5-S1 to this

          19   specific incident.

          20   Q.     Doctor, when you assigned those

          21   specific levels, is it because you saw

          22   something traumatic on the MRI film that

          23   caused you to render that conclusion?

          24   A.     No, not at all.  You don't really look

                                                           62



           1   at morphology on an MRI and characterize

           2   traumatic versus atraumatic etiology.  The

           3   only thing you can describe is what it

           4   appears to show from your perspective.  As I

           5   said, I agreed with the radiologist.

           6          Interesting, there is no postoperative

           7   findings, such as laminectomy or a bone that

           8   was removed or anything that would indicate

           9   surgery.  I'm not sure that there was a

          10   particular surgical procedure.  I haven't

          11   seen any records, but this MRI didn't show

          12   any post-op changes.

          13   Q.     Doctor, a moment ago, you were shown

          14   Exhibit-4, which is a report from Dr. Rosin.

          15   In that report, he also comments on the MRI

          16   taken April 23, 2018.

          17          Would you agree with me that

          18   Dr. Rosin, upon review of that MRI, indicated

          19   that there were degenerative changes on that

          20   MRI?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Now, Doctor, you performed an

          23   examination of Fr. Mularczyk's shoulder when

          24   you met with him; is that correct?

                                                           63



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     You had alluded to a section of your

           3   report where you discussed the findings; is

           4   that correct?

           5   A.     Yes.  I don't think there were very

           6   many findings, so I didn't elaborate.  He had

           7   had surgery, so I think it was successful

           8   from the standpoint of the function of the

           9   shoulder.

          10   Q.     Doctor, is it your opinion that

          11   Fr. Mularczyk sustained a partial thickness

          12   tear of the supraspinatus tendon in the right

          13   shoulder as a result of this accident?

          14   A.     I believe that to be true, yes.

          15   Q.     Doctor, are you basing that

          16   conclusion, again, on the MRI film that was

          17   taken after this accident?

          18   A.     In part.  Certainly the history that

          19   he provided, proximity to the incident when

          20   the shoulder symptoms came about, all of that

          21   is certainly factored in.

          22   Q.     Doctor, this MRI was taken only one

          23   month after the accident, correct?

          24   A.     Yes.

                                                           64



           1   Q.     You would agree with me, having

           2   reviewed the film and the report, that there

           3   is no edema or swelling noted on the MRI?

           4   A.     I think that's fair, yes.

           5   Q.     There is also no hemorrhaging or

           6   bleeding that was noted on the MRI?

           7   A.     Correct.

           8   Q.     Doctor, given those lack of signs,

           9   would you agree with me that partial tears of

          10   the supraspinatus tendon are generally not

          11   associated with traumatic changes but rather

          12   in the context of chronic wear on the tendons

          13   of the shoulder?

          14   A.     No, that precept is ill-founded.  In

          15   fact, we don't see those kind of things

          16   because the tendon itself has a terrible

          17   blood supply.  Bleeding will come from

          18   muscle, if it's injured.  This was actually a

          19   tendon of the cuff.  So I wouldn't expect to

          20   see those particular changes, and not

          21   everything that's torn has edema or swelling

          22   associated with it.

          23          The concept that it comes from other

          24   than trauma is again, with all due respect to

                                                           65



           1   you, ill-founded.

           2   Q.     Doctor, would you agree that partial

           3   tears can result from the AC joint becoming

           4   arthritic and bone spurs eroding the rotator

           5   cuff tendon?

           6   A.     No.  I've been doing this for 35

           7   years.  I've never seen that.  It may be

           8   alluded to in the literature, but in real

           9   life I've never seen it happen.

          10   Q.     Doctor, you would agree that there

          11   were some arthritic changes noted in the AC

          12   joint of the MRI?

          13   A.     Right.  That's the joint I showed on

          14   the model between the acromion and the actual

          15   collar bone, or the clavicle, as it's known.

          16   Q.     Doctor, just a few more things on the

          17   MRI.  There was no evidence of inflammation,

          18   correct?

          19   A.     I don't think you're seeing anything

          20   of that nature on the MR.  That's fair, yes.

          21   Q.     There is no evidence of articulating

          22   surface abnormality, correct?

          23   A.     No spurs or items like that that would

          24   tend to be irritating to the structures.

                                                           66



           1   Q.     Doctor, when is the last time that

           2   Fr. Mularczyk has seen a doctor or therapist

           3   related to this accident?

           4   A.     Good question.  I don't know the exact

           5   date.  I don't have any dates on here.  I

           6   just listed the records themselves.  If you

           7   have a date, I'll certainly stipulate that

           8   would be the correct date.

           9   Q.     Doctor, you're not claiming that

          10   Fr. Mularczyk has had any scarring as a

          11   result of this accident, correct?

          12   A.     Well, I believe that he does have

          13   scarring, yes.

          14   Q.     Will you show us where you've

          15   discussed that in your report?

          16   A.     I didn't discuss it in the report.

          17   It's just a natural history of having these

          18   types of injuries more so in the shoulder,

          19   I'll say, than in the low back.

          20   Q.     You're not a plastic surgeon, correct?

          21   A.     I've done plastic procedures, but I am

          22   not a board certified plastic surgeon, yes.

          23   Q.     Doctor, does Fr. Mularczyk presently

          24   have any appointments scheduled to receive

                                                           67



           1   any of the future medical care that you've

           2   described?

           3   A.     I wouldn't be aware of any other

           4   visits that he might have to address these

           5   issues.

           6   Q.     Although you are of the opinion he

           7   will require future medical care, you did not

           8   refer him to any doctors for any of this

           9   care, correct?

          10   A.     Right.  In my role as an expert and

          11   not a treating physician, I wouldn't have

          12   done that.  I may have discussed his findings

          13   with him as a courtesy to him, as I do with

          14   most people, but I did not offer any

          15   referrals from a treating standpoint.

          16               MR. RONG:  Thank you, Doctor.

          17               THE WITNESS:  Your welcome.

          18   Thanks.

          20                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

          21                       - - -

          22   BY MS. MCCARTHY:

          23   Q.     I just have a couple follow-ups.

          24          Dr. Yarus, you were asked how much you

                                                           68



           1   charge for the exams?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     You do this as an expert, yes?

           4   A.     About 10 to 15 percent of my total

           5   time spent as a physician is in this kind of

           6   arena, yes.

           7   Q.     Do you know any experts who do this

           8   for free?

           9   A.     I think some of us, if it calls for

          10   it, will give a free deposition here and

          11   there, but I like to get paid for my time.

          12   Most of the time I do get paid for my time

          13   doing these types of depositions or

          14   evaluations.

          15   Q.     It's fair to say that you expect to be

          16   paid for your work?

          17   A.     Sure, absolutely I do.

          18   Q.     Counsel asked you about how much

          19   you've been paid between 2018 and 2019 for

          20   your expert services from the Simon law firm.

          21          Do you recall that?

          22   A.     I think he went from 2014 up to the

          23   present perhaps, but, yes, I remember the

          24   question.

                                                           69



           1   Q.     I'm sorry, did I miss 2014 to the

           2   present?

           3   A.     I believe that was the timeframe, yes.

           4   Q.     Over five years, I believe you said

           5   approximately $2 million?

           6   A.     Correct.

           7   Q.     Let's put this in perspective.

           8          How many offices do you have,

           9   Dr. Yarus?

          10   A.     Right now I have three offices.

          11   Q.     The money that you bring in for

          12   litigation -- and not just from the Simon law

          13   firm but from the litigation work that you do

          14   across the board -- - where does that go?

          15   A.     Well, it goes to the practice.  It

          16   doesn't go in my pocket.  If you know

          17   anything about businesses, even the medical

          18   business and I'll call it that, it's 65

          19   percent overhead.  So we have to pay for

          20   those offices, the lighting, electricity, the

          21   people that I employ and I'm part of that

          22   corporation as the sole physician, but all of

          23   these expenses go into keeping this going.

          24   It's pretty hefty as far as percentages.

           1   Q.     How many employees do you have?

           2   A.     In this office, I have three.  I have

           3   two others in Pittsburgh.  I have probably

           4   seven to eight at any given time.

           5   Q.     You were asked about whether or not

           6   Fr. Mularczyk missed any time from work.

           7          How would you characterize his

           8   physical requirements?

           9   A.     Well, he's a preacher.  As a pastor,

          10   unless he's doing Habitat For Humanity and

          11   those kinds of things, physically I don't

          12   think it's a demanding job.  It's a tentorial

          13   job, meaning he uses his brain and his

          14   knowledge to do what he does.  I would say

          15   it's a minimally stressful job as far as

          16   activity.

          17   Q.     You were asked about, I think, what

          18   we've had marked as Yarus-4, that was

          19   Dr. Rosin?

          20   A.     Correct.

          21   Q.     Who was treating Fr. Mularczyk?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Pertaining to the report, Dr. Rosin

          24   said that Fr. Mularczyk received injuries

           1   sustained in a motor vehicle accident, which

           2   occurred on April 19, 2018, correct?

           3   A.     That's correct.

           4   Q.     I want to talk a little bit about the

           5   MRI, specifically of the shoulder.

           6          You were asked about whether or not

           7   there was any edema or bleeding?

           8   A.     Right.

           9   Q.     Now, as it pertains to the shoulder,

          10   the labrum was torn; is that correct -- or

          11   there was a shoulder tear?

          12   A.     Supraspinatus tendon.

          13   Q.     Fair to say that site doesn't bleed

          14   very much?

          15   A.     It doesn't.  It doesn't have a great

          16   blood supply, so you're not going to see a

          17   lot of bleeding from there.  If the muscle --

          18   at the junction of the tendon, muscle becomes

          19   tendon, tendon inserts some bone.  When that

          20   occurs, you may see some bleeding.  But after

          21   a month, the body has an amazing ability to

          22   shut that down.

          23          Any bleeding that occurs in the muscle

          24   itself will stop just from coagulation

           1   standpoint.  I don't know that he has any

           2   medical conditions that would preclude him

           3   from being able to coagulate.  It's not an

           4   area where you're going to see bleeding into

           5   the joint.

           6   Q.     That doesn't surprise you that there

           7   was no -- you didn't see any bleeding?

           8   A.     No, especially after a month when the

           9   study was done.  I wouldn't expect it to be

          10   as intense as if the study was done on the

          11   same day.  You might see some of those

          12   things, but after this amount of time it's

          13   not unusual with this type of tear.

           1   Q.     Doctor, have any of counsel's

           2   questions on cross changed your opinion in

           3   this matter?

           4   A.     Respectfully, I would hold the same

           5   opinions.  I wouldn't change any of the ones

           6   I gave today.

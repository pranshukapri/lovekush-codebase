            1      LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; FRIDAY, AUGUST 16, 2019;

            2                         11:03 A.M.

            3                            -oOo-

            4             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are now on the

            5    record.  My name is Tony Bloodworth.  I'm a

            6    videographer retained by Lexitas.

            7             This is a video deposition for the Superior

            8    Court, State of California, County of Los Angeles.

            9    The case number is BC616624.

           10             Today's date is August 16, 2019.  The time

           11    is approximately 11:03 a.m.  This deposition is

           12    being held at 1640 5th Street in Santa Monica,

           13    California.

           14             The matter is Cerneka, et al., versus

           15    Russell No. 8 Santa Monica Properties, et al.

           16             The deponent is Christopher McGrath,

           17    Volume II.

           18             The court reporter today is Carre Lewis.

           19             Would all counsel please identify

           20    themselves and state who they represent.

           21             MR. SWENSON:  Good morning.  John Swenson

           22    from Scali Rasmussen on behalf of plaintiffs.

           23             MS. BACON:  Good morning.  Tiffany Bacon

           24    from Buchalter on behalf of defendants.

           25             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Will the court reporter


                                                                     4





            1    please swear in the witness.

            2    Whereupon --

            3                    CHRISTOPHER McGRATH,

            4    having been first duly sworn to testify to the

            5    truth, was examined and testified as follows:

            6                         EXAMINATION

            7    BY MS. BACON:

            8        Q.   Good morning, Mr. McGrath.

            9        A.   Good morning.

           10        Q.   Thank you for being with us again today.

           11    Do you recall the ground rules for the deposition

           12    that we went over last time?

           13        A.   No, ma'am.

           14        Q.   Okay.  We will go over them quickly.

           15             So before I began asking you questions, you

           16    took an oath with the court reporter to tell the

           17    truth here today, and with that oath, it holds the

           18    same force and effect as if you were testifying in a

           19    court of law and the penalty of perjury attaches.

           20             Do you understand that?

           21        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           22        Q.   And remember always to give audible

           23    responses, so no shaking of your head or "uh-huh" or

           24    "huh-uh," things like that, to make sure it's clear

           25    for the record.  Okay?


                                                                     5





            1        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            2        Q.   Thank you.

            3             If for some reason you don't understand a

            4    question that I have asked you, please ask me to

            5    repeat it or rephrase it so we can make sure we get

            6    a clean record.  Okay?

            7        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            8        Q.   Thank you.

            9             And this is not an endurance test, so if at

           10    any time you need to take break to get some water --

           11        A.   Break?

           12        Q.   -- or go to --

           13        A.   No.

           14        Q.   -- the restroom, please let me know.  Okay?

           15        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           16        Q.   I would just ask that there be no

           17    simultaneous speaking, so please make sure that you

           18    let me finish my question before you provide your

           19    answer.  Okay?

           20        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           21        Q.   Thank you.

           22             Is there any reason can you not provide me

           23    with your most accurate and truthful testimony

           24    today?

           25        A.   No, ma'am.


                                                                     6





            1        Q.   Have you taken any drugs or alcohol in the

            2    last 24 to 48 hours that might impair your ability

            3    to give me your best testimony?

            4        A.   No, ma'am.

            5        Q.   And obviously we are talking about the

            6    building at 1605 and 1605 1/2 Ocean Front Walk in

            7    Santa Monica here today.

            8             Do you remember that?

            9        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           10        Q.   Whenever I say "buildings," that's what I

           11    will be referring to.  Okay?

           12        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           13        Q.   All right.  And whenever I say "city," I'm

           14    obviously referring to the City of Santa Monica.

           15    Okay?

           16        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           17        Q.   Thank you.

           18             All right.  I will go ahead and mark as

           19    Exhibit 240 Defendants' Second Amended Notice of

           20    Continued Deposition of Plaintiff Christopher

           21    McGrath and Request for Production.

           22             (Exhibit 240 marked.)

           23    BY MS. BACON:

           24        Q.   Now, Mr. McGrath, you have seen a document

           25    similar to this before that we went over during the


                                                                     7





            1    first volume of your deposition.  And last we spoke,

            2    you referenced that you might have additional

            3    records that are responsive to the requests that are

            4    provided in this deposition notice.

            5             Did you search for any documents further,

            6    after your first deposition, that might be

            7    responsive to the requests that are in this notice

            8    of deposition?

            9        A.   I'm not sure what I was looking for.

           10        Q.   Did you search for any photographs of your

           11    unit or of the building?

           12        A.   Oh, yeah, yeah.

           13        Q.   Did you find any photographs?

           14        A.   No.  I didn't have any.  But our friend

           15    Louis did, who was in the case.  He had some

           16    pictures.  He has pictures, but he passed away.

           17        Q.   When you say "Lou," do you mean Louis

           18    Mifsud?

           19        A.   Yeah.  Yes, ma'am.

           20        Q.   So you don't have any photographs in your

           21    possession of the building or of your unit?

           22        A.   I remember looking, but I didn't find any.

           23        Q.   So as far as you are aware, you have

           24    produced all of the documents that are responsive to

           25    the requests that in this notice of deposition,


                                                                     8





            1    correct?

            2        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            3        Q.   And you didn't bring any documents with you

            4    today; is that correct?

            5        A.   Correct.

            6        Q.   Do you recall signing a retainer agreement,

            7    either with LAFLA -- when I say "LAFLA," I mean the

            8    Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles -- or with Scali

            9    Rasmussen, your attorneys in this case?

           10        A.   Do I remember?  No, but I'm sure I did sign

           11    them.

           12        Q.   Do you know what percentage of the

           13    settlement or judgment amount your attorneys will be

           14    receiving based off of that retainer agreement?

           15             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Calls for

           16    attorney-client privileged communication.  I'm

           17    instructing the witness not to answer.

           18             MS. BACON:  I would just like to state for

           19    the record that it is relevant for purposes of this

           20    case, because plaintiffs' counsel are requesting

           21    attorney's fees based off of certain of the claims

           22    that are being made in this case.

           23             So you are instructing him not to answer?

           24             MR. SWENSON:  Correct.  If you want to meet

           25    and confer off the record -- we are available to


                                                                     9





            1    meet and confer, but my understanding is that's

            2    privileged and we do not intend to waive the

            3    privilege.

            4             MS. BACON:  Understood.  We can meet and

            5    confer about it off the record.  As I said, I think

            6    it's relevant and discoverable in this case given

            7    the claims are being made and the requests for

            8    attorney's fees.  We are entitled to know the

            9    percentage that counsel will be receiving in this

           10    matter.

           11    BY MS. BACON:

           12        Q.   Mr. McGrath, do you contend that you were

           13    injured by the defendants in some way in this

           14    matter?

           15             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent that

           16    it calls for a legal conclusion and/or

           17    attorney-client privilege and/or expert opinion.

           18             THE WITNESS:  Answer?

           19             MR. SWENSON:  You can answer to the extent

           20    you understand it.

           21             THE WITNESS:  What was it again, dear?

           22    BY MS. BACON:

           23        Q.   Sure.  Do you contend that you have

           24    suffered some sort of injury as a result of the

           25    defendants' actions as it relates to this case?


                                                                    10





            1        A.   Some sort of injuries, physical, or just

            2    mentally.

            3        Q.   Either one.

            4        A.   Yeah, I have.

            5        Q.   Okay.  And what are those injuries?

            6             MR. SWENSON:  Same objections to the extent

            7    it calls for attorney-client privilege, expert

            8    opinion and/or legal conclusion.

            9             THE WITNESS:  I had the smoke -- I had to

           10    go to the smoking place the first night, and then,

           11    you know, if I smell fire now I like get scared, if

           12    I think I smell a fire.

           13    BY MS. BACON:

           14        Q.   So you had smoke inhalation as a result of

           15    the fire; is that correct?

           16        A.   The next day I had to go to get the asthma

           17    sprayer and stuff like that, and I don't have

           18    asthma.

           19        Q.   And you said you are now scared of fire,

           20    correct?

           21        A.   If I smell something -- if I think I smell

           22    something, you know, I get a little jumpy.

           23        Q.   Have you seen anybody for those, I guess,

           24    fears that you have or -- when you smell something

           25    or it smells like fire?


                                                                    11





            1        A.   Yeah, I go to -- I go to a therapist, DiDi

            2    Hirsch.

            3        Q.   And you were going to DiDi Hirsch prior to

            4    the fire; is that correct?

            5        A.   I used to go years ago, but not -- not like

            6    right before the fire, no.  Maybe two or three years

            7    ago I went.  I used to see a lady.

            8        Q.   Okay.

            9        A.   Then I didn't go for a long time.  And now

           10    after that, I started going.  Once a week usually

           11    or -- couple times a month.

           12        Q.   How many times had you seen or went to DiDi

           13    Hirsch prior to the fire happening?

           14        A.   Maybe 20.

           15        Q.   20 times?

           16        A.   Yeah.

           17        Q.   Over a course of how many years?

           18        A.   Maybe one year.

           19        Q.   In one year?

           20        A.   Yeah.

           21        Q.   Do you recall what year that was?

           22        A.   No, ma'am.

           23             MS. BACON:  Denise, do you want to make

           24    your appearance on the record since you are here.

            3    BY MS. BACON:

            4        Q.   All right.  Sir, any other injury other

            5    than the smoke inhalation from -- as a result of the

            6    fire and now being scared or being jumpy when you

            7    smell things that might smell like fire?

            8             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent it

            9    calls for a legal conclusion, expert opinion, and/or

           10    invades the attorney-client privileged.

           11             THE WITNESS:  What was the question again?

           12             MS. BACON:  If you could repeat back the

           13    question.

           14             (Thereupon, the record was read by the

           15             court reporter as follows:  "Q. Sir, any

           16             other injury other than the smoke

           21             MR. SWENSON:  Same objections.

           22             THE WITNESS:  Just, you know, just mentally

           23    you know, it was a big deal and it's hard to get out

           24    of your head.

            1        Q.   So mentally, how have you been affected as

            2    a result of --

           10        Q.   You can answer now, sir.

           11        A.   You know, I just be scared sometimes, you

           12    know, thinking there's a fire.

           13        Q.   What mental health issues did you suffer

           14    from prior to the fire?

           15        A.   None.

           16        Q.   Why were you going to DiDi Hirsch prior to

           17    the fire?

           18        A.   Just to talk about my, you know,

           19    relationships, like with my mom and stuff.

           20        Q.   Did you suffer from depression prior to the

           21    fire?

           22        A.   No, ma'am.

           23        Q.   Did you suffer from anxiety prior to the

           24    fire?

           25        A.   I'm not sure what that means.


                                                                    14





            1        Q.   Did you ever have times where you felt

            2    anxious or panicked or something along those lines

            3    as a result of some sort of trigger?

            4        A.   Panic, no.  Had a little anxiety, I guess.

            5    That's it.  Whoops.

            6        Q.   Had you ever been diagnosed with depression

            7    prior to the fire?

            8        A.   No, ma'am.

            9        Q.   Have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety

           10    disorder prior to the fire?

           11        A.   No, ma'am.

           12        Q.   So you said you have gone to DiDi Hirsch

           13    since the fire, correct?

           14        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           15        Q.   And for what reason have you gone to DiDi

           16    Hirsch since the fire?

           17        A.   Just to talk about, you know, my feelings

           18    about, you know, family matters and stuff.

           19        Q.   So is it the same things that you were

           20    discussing with DiDi Hirsch prior to the fire?

           21        A.   Similar.

           22        Q.   Did DiDi Hirsch or any physician there

           23    diagnose you with anything after the fire?

           24             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent --

           25    objection to the extent that it calls for

            3        Q.   You can answer.

            4        A.   They are just therapists, they are not

            5    doctors.

            6        Q.   So they are just -- they are not

            7    psychiatrists?

            8        A.   No.

            9        Q.   Okay.  Are they psychologists?

           10        A.   I think so, yeah.  The ones that don't give

           11    the medicine?

           12        Q.   Uh-huh.

           13        A.   Yeah.

           14        Q.   And as far as you are aware, any

           15    psychologist that you have seen at DiDi Hirsch has

           16    not diagnosed you with any sort of condition; is

           17    that correct?

           18        A.   That's correct.

           19        Q.   During your last deposition, you indicated

           20    that you had access to your medical records from

           21    DiDi Hirsch.  Do you recall that testimony?

           22        A.   From DiDi Hirsch?  No, I don't remember

           23    that testimony.

           24        Q.   Do you have access to medical records from

           25    your treatment at DiDi Hirsch?


                                                                    16





            1        A.   I don't know.  I have them from my medical,

            2    real medical doctor, UCLA.  I know I can get copies

            3    of that stuff.  I don't -- I never asked for

            4    anything from DiDi Hirsch.

            5        Q.   Are you able to access those records online

            6    from DiDi Hirsch?

            7        A.   I never tried.

            8             MS. BACON:  I think during the last

            9    deposition we had requested that he search for those

           10    records and produce them here today, so I would ask

           11    that that be done.

           12             THE WITNESS:  They won't -- I think you

           13    meant the medical, UCLA.

            1    since the fire?

            2        A.   Well, the fire was a long time ago, so I

            3    will say approximately 15 times.

            4        Q.   So about three times a year, on average?

            5        A.   No -- oh, no.  Just 15 times in the last

            6    year.

            7        Q.   Fifteen times in this last year?

            8        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            9        Q.   Okay.  So since the fire -- I know the fire

           10    was about five years ago now almost.

           11        A.   Three, almost four.  December will be four.

           12        Q.   How many times have you been to DiDi Hirsch

           13    since the fire?

           14        A.   About 15.

           15        Q.   Fifteen times?

           16        A.   Yes, ma'am, since the fire.

           17        Q.   So those 15 times have all been within the

           18    last year?

           19        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           20        Q.   So the three years right after the fire,

           21    you never went to DiDi Hirsch; is that correct?

           22        A.   That's correct.

           23        Q.   Do you believe the defendants caused you to

           24    suffer financial harm?

           25        A.   Definitely.

            7             MR. SWENSON:  Same objections.

            8             THE WITNESS:  Well, I lost everything I --

            9    all my property burned up, and then, you know, the

           10    keys to the car and everything I had, you know, that

           11    was in that room is gone, you know.  And then we had

           12    to get all new stuff, you know.  Had to store our

           13    stuff in storage.  We had to buy new socks and

           14    underwear and clothes and shoes, and redo the key on

           15    the car and -- yeah, we lost a lot of stuff.

           16    (Inaudible.)  All my stuff burned up.

           17    BY MS. BACON:

           18        Q.   So all of the financial harm you have

           19    suffered is as a result of what you lost in the

           20    fire; is that correct?

           21             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Misstates --

           22             THE WITNESS:  Well, that's some of it.

           23             MR. SWENSON:  -- testimony, and further

           24    objection to the extent that it calls for a legal

           25    conclusion, expert opinion, and/or invades the


                                                                    19





            1    attorney-client privilege.

            2             THE WITNESS:  You know, you have to get a

            3    new license, stuff like that, you know.  Didn't --

            4    but you know all that added up.  Had to redo

            5    everything.  Shut off all of the credit cards, pay

            6    the cable bills even though, you know, we couldn't

            7    keep the contracts up and stuff like that, you know.

            8    It was -- it was a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble.

            9    BY MS. BACON:

           10        Q.   So you are referring to the things that you

           11    had to do because you had -- because you had to move

           12    from the property because of the fire; is that

           13    correct?

           14        A.   And everything burned up in there, yeah,

           15    all that.  Yes, ma'am.

           16        Q.   Do you have an approximate amount of --

           17    strike that.

           18             Of the things that you lost as a result of

           19    the fire, can you estimate in dollar amounts how

           20    much that was worth?

           21        A.   I can't estimate it.

           22        Q.   Was it more than a thousand?

           23        A.   Yeah, more -- a lot more than a thousand.

           24        Q.   Was it more than 2,000?

           25        A.   Yeah.  Yes, ma'am.


                                                                    20





            1        Q.   What did you lose in the fire?

            2        A.   I lost all my clothes.  I lost my baseball

            3    card collection.  I lost two bicycles.  I lost a lot

            4    of jewelry, a lot of cash -- not a lot of cash,

            5    maybe $1,200.  And Christmas gifts.  The baby's

            6    Barbie Dream House burned up, keys to my car, the

            7    TV, the bed, everything.  Everything you would have

            8    in a regular apartment.

            9        Q.   Did you ever have your baseball card

           10    collection valued?

           11        A.   Only by friends.

           12        Q.   So you don't know specifically how much

           13    those baseball cards were worth?

           14        A.   Specifically, no, ma'am.

           15        Q.   So you said you lost clothes, your baseball

           16    card collection, $1,200 in cash?

           17        A.   Couple bicycles.

           18        Q.   How much were the bicycles worth?

           19        A.   Couple thousand dollars.

           20        Q.   A couple thousands for bicycles?

           21        A.   Yeah.

           22        Q.   What kind of bicycles were they?

           23        A.   Racing bikes.

           24        Q.   Who was the manufacturer?

           25        A.   Scott, I believe.  They were Team USA --


                                                                    21





            1    one was Team USA, one was like a mountain bike.

            2        Q.   What kind of TV did you have?

            3        A.   Just like a big Vizio flat screen.

            4        Q.   In what year did you purchase the TV?

            5        A.   Maybe 2015.

            6        Q.   So the same year as the fire?

            7        A.   Yeah, right before Christmas.

            8        Q.   Did you purchase it new?

            9        A.   Yeah.  Yes, ma'am.

           10        Q.   Anything else that you lost in the fire?

           11        A.   Any -- any material things, you mean?

           12        Q.   Correct.

           13        A.   I had a lot of stuff in there.  I lost

           14    everything I had.

           15        Q.   Was all of it burned or was some of it

           16    damaged due to smoke?

           17        A.   Yeah.  Some was damaged due to smoke, like

           18    a lot of the clothes.

           19        Q.   What were you able to remove from the room

           20    after the fire?

           21        A.   I removed a lot of stuff, but I just threw

           22    it in the trash, but I kept a few outfits and -- I

           23    couldn't keep the bed.  I kept some clothes, some

           24    clothes that didn't get burned up.

           25        Q.   Anything else besides clothes?


                                                                    22





            1        A.   Maybe some tools, metal tools.

            2        Q.   Do you believe the defendants caused you

            3    any financ- -- or physical harm?

            4             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent that

            5    it calls for expert opinion, legal conclusion,

            6    and/or invades the attorney-client privilege.

            7             THE WITNESS:  Physical?  I don't know what

            8    you mean by that.

            9    BY MS. BACON:

           10        Q.   While you were living in the building, as a

           11    result of the defendants, did you suffer any

           12    physical harm?

           13             MR. SWENSON:  Same objections.

           14             THE WITNESS:  Maybe from the bed bugs and

           15    stuff like that, and the roaches.

           16    BY MS. BACON:

           17        Q.   What physical harm did you suffer as a

           18    result of bed bugs?

           19        A.   They bite you, bite you.

           20        Q.   How many times were you bitten by bed bugs?

           21        A.   Quite a few.  Quite a few.

           22        Q.   Can you estimate how many times a month?

           23        A.   I can't estimate.

           24             MR. SWENSON:  Vague and ambiguous as to

           25    scope of time.


                                                                    23





            1             THE WITNESS:  It's been a long time.

            2    BY MS. BACON:

            3        Q.   What physical harm did you suffer as a

            4    result of roaches?

            5        A.   I lost like 20 pounds one month.  I don't

            6    know why, but I think it had to do with them.  But,

            7    you know, the roaches are always running around, you

            8    know.  They are nasty.  Just --

            9        Q.   Do you think you lost 20 pounds because of

           10    the roaches?

           11        A.   I think I did.  They --

           12        Q.   And why is that?

           13        A.   -- stressed me out.  Stressed me out.  You

           14    know, my girl -- didn't want my daughter to come

           15    over there because of the bed bugs, and that was a

           16    big deal.  So, you know, it was a lot of physical

           17    pain there.

           18        Q.   Did you speak to anyone in preparation for

           19    your deposition today?

           20             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent that

           21    it calls for attorney-client privileged information.

           22    BY MS. BACON:

           23        Q.   Other than your counsel?

           24        A.   Oh, no.

           25        Q.   Have you spoken with any of the tenants


                                                                    24





            1    from the building since your last deposition?

            2        A.   Yes, of course.

            3             MR. SWENSON:  Belated objection to the

            4    extent that any of those conversations took place

            5    with counsel.

            6    BY MS. BACON:

            7        Q.   And who have you spoken with, who was a

            8    former tenant in the building, since your last

            9    deposition, outside of the presence of your

           10    attorneys?

           11        A.   I spoke to Lenny.  Who else was there?  I

           12    spoke to Lou before he passed.  And who else?  And I

           13    spoke to some people who aren't in this case that

           14    lived in the building.

           15        Q.   And who was that?

           16        A.   Rick Newton and another guy, his name is

           17    Mike, Little Mikey, but I don't know his last name.

           18        Q.   What did you talk to Lenny about in that

           19    conversation or conversations?

           20        A.   Well, I had my girls with me.  He was going

           21    to the pier to perform and we just pulled up on him

           22    and just talked to him about what's going on.

           23        Q.   Did you talk about the case?

           24        A.   No.

           25        Q.   Did you ever talk to Lenny about this case


                                                                    25





            1    since your last deposition?

            2        A.   I'm sure I have.

            3        Q.   What did you discuss with him?

            4        A.   How the case was going, what we are going

            5    to do, you know, stuff like that.

            6        Q.   When you say "what you are going to do,"

            7    what do you mean by that?

            8        A.   You know, what are -- you know, we got to

            9    go to trial and stuff, so we got to get ready.

           10        Q.   Get ready how?

           11        A.   Be prepared to go down there every day and

           12    testify.

           13        Q.   Is that all you talked to Lenny about with

           14    respect to this case since your last deposition?

           15        A.   In regards to the case, I'm pretty -- I'm

           16    sure that's probably about it.

           17        Q.   What did you talk to Louis about since your

           18    last deposition?

           19        A.   He was going home that night, so I took him

           20    a Yankee's jacket.  We didn't talk about the case.

           21    We just talked about he was sick and he was going to

           22    go home to New York.

           23        Q.   When you say "that night," what are you --

           24        A.   The night before he left, about a month ago

           25    or couple months ago.  He was leaving in the morning


                                                                    26





            1    on the plane so I went to see him.

            2        Q.   What did you talk to Rick Newton about

            3    since your last deposition?

            4        A.   We just talked -- he is a friend of mine.

            5    Nothing about the case, because he is not in the

            6    case, but just, you know, daily stuff, what's going

            7    on with the daughter.

            8        Q.   And the same with Little Mikey, you didn't

            9    discuss the case with him?

           10        A.   No, ma'am.  He used to live -- they both

           11    lived in the building but they just -- one wasn't

           12    there at the time of the fire and the other one,

           13    Rick, he -- he just not in the case.

           14        Q.   Did he ever tell you a reason why he

           15    decided not to take part in the case?

           16        A.   I'm not sure why.  I don't remember if he

           17    told me why.

           18        Q.   Did you review any documents in preparation

           19    for your deposition today?

           20        A.   Review?  No.  I looked at some pictures.

           21        Q.   Whose pictures did you look at?

           22        A.   Pictures on my phone from the ceiling fans

           23    and stuff --

           24             MR. SWENSON:  I'm going to object to the

           25    extent that any documents were reviewed with


                                                                    27





            1    counsel.

            2    BY MS. BACON:

            3        Q.   When you were looking at those pictures on

            4    your phone, were they in the -- when you were in the

            5    presence of counsel?

            6        A.   Yeah.  They made a copy of the picture so I

            7    could see it better.  So yeah, I was with John.

            8        Q.   Okay.  Anything that you looked at outside

            9    the presence of counsel?

           10        A.   Anything?

           11        Q.   Any documents that you reviewed outside the

           12    presence of counsel?

           13        A.   No, ma'am.

           14        Q.   Other than those pictures that you referred

           15    to, did you review anything else in preparation for

           16    your deposition?

           17        A.   No, ma'am.

           18        Q.   Were you employed at the time of the fire?

           19        A.   I'm not sure.  I don't remember.  I was

           21             MR. SWENSON:  I'm going to object to the

           22    extent it's been asked and answered.

           24        Q.   When was the last time you were employed

           25    prior to the fire?


                                                                    28





            1        A.   I'm not sure.

            2             MR. SWENSON:  Same objection.

            3    BY MS. BACON:

            4        Q.   Did you obtain employment after the fire?

            5        A.   Yes, ma'am.  I worked at UPS.

            6        Q.   When did you start working at UPS after the

            7    fire?

            8        A.   I'm not sure.  I think it was in

            9    October 2018.

           10        Q.   October 2018 is when you first started

           11    working at UPS, correct?

           12        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           13        Q.   So between the time of the fire and

           14    October 2018, were you employed anywhere?

           15        A.   I think I was.  I was driving 18-wheeler, I

           16    believe.  I'm not sure.

           17        Q.   You are not sure if you were employed?

           18        A.   It's been so long, I don't remember.  I

           19    would have to check my taxes.

           20        Q.   During your last deposition you mentioned

           21    that in the past you were charged with commercial

           22    burglary.  Do you recall that testimony?

           23        A.   Attempted commercial burglary, yeah, I

           24    remember.

           25        Q.   When were you charged with attempted


                                                                    29





            1    commercial burglary?

            2        A.   1992, I believe.

            3        Q.   Were you convicted?

            4        A.   I pled guilty, so yes.

            5        Q.   Were you -- did you go to jail as a result

            6    of pleading guilty?

            7        A.   I believe I did.

            8        Q.   For how long?

            9        A.   For how long?  A few years.

           10        Q.   Is that the only time that you have been in

           11    jail?

           12        A.   No.

           13             MR. SWENSON:  I'm going to object to the

           14    extent that any further questions on this topic

           15    invade his right to privacy, and instruct the

           16    witness not to answer.

           17    BY MS. BACON:

           18        Q.   And when you pled guilty to commercial

           19    burglary, was that a felony?

           20             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Misstates

           21    testimony.

           22             THE WITNESS:  Attempted commercial

           23    burglary.  Attempted commercial burglary.  Yeah,

           24    it's a felony.

            1        Q.   Have you been charged with any other

            2    crimes?

            3             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Invades privacy.

            4    Irrelevant.  And I instruct the witness not to

            5    answer.

            6             MS. BACON:  This is relevant, John.  You

            7    know it's relevant.

            8             MR. SWENSON:  Felony convictions are

            9    relevant -- are fair to question.  Other charges of

           10    crimes are irrelevant, and I'm instructing the

           11    witness not to answer.  And if you want to mark the

           12    record and move to compel, we can deal with it that

           13    way.

           18             MS. BACON:  At any time.

           19             THE WITNESS:  Am I supposed to answer?

           20             MR. SWENSON:  If you have been charged with

           21    a felony, you can answer.

           22             THE WITNESS:  I think -- I'm not sure.  I'm

           23    not sure.

           24    BY MS. BACON:

           25        Q.   Have you been convicted of another felony,


                                                                    31





            1    other than attempted commercial burglary?

            2        A.   Not that I'm aware of.

            3        Q.   So other times that you were in jail, for

            4    how long were you in jail?

            5             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Misstates

            6    testimony and invades privacy.  I'm going to

            7    instruct the witness not to answer.

            8             I respectfully submit that whether or not

            9    he has spent other time in jail is not relevant to

           10    any issue in this case.

           11             MS. BACON:  It is relevant if he was

           12    convicted of a felony.

           13             MR. SWENSON:  And he has given you his

           14    testimony as to his best recollection of any

           15    conviction of a felony, and he recalled an instance

           16    and he doesn't recall another time.  That's his

           17    testimony.

            2    BY MS. BACON:

            3        Q.   You don't recall if that was a misdemeanor

            4    or a felony conviction; is that correct?

            5             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.

           10             MS. MCGRANAHAN:  Madam Court Reporter, how

            6        Q.   How of- --

            7        A.   -- I don't smoke every day.  Like once in a

           10        Q.   So how old were you when you first started

           20        A.   Maybe once, like every couple weeks, I

           21    might have a cigarette.

           22        Q.   Were you purchasing the cigarettes

           23    yourself?

           10        A.   Well, you know, sometimes says, You got a

           11    cigarette?  You got a cigarette?  So if I have one,

           12    I might give 'em one, but I didn't make a habit of

           24        Q.   So since the 1970s, you haven't smoked

                                                                    36





            1        A.   I'm sure she mentioned it, yeah.

            2        Q.   She mentioned to you that she was not

            3    getting heat?

            4        A.   Yeah.  Her heater was all burnt up up

            5    there.  It was all -- it was shot-out melted.  So I

            6    don't know if it worked.  It made a lot of noise.

            7    But yeah.

            8        Q.   Did she ever tell you that when she

            9    attempted to turn on the heater that the heater was

           10    not producing heat?

           11        A.   Yeah.

           12        Q.   She told you that the ceiling heater, when

           13    she turned it on, was not producing heat?

           15             THE WITNESS:  Well, yeah, she told me that,

           16    but I was already at her house, so I would've turn

           17    it on, myself, to see what was up, and it made a lot

           18    of noise, like clang, clang, clang, clang, clang,

           19    but there was no heat coming.

           20    BY MS. BACON:

           21        Q.   How do you know there was no heat coming

           22    out of it?

           23        A.   Because I could -- well, I have the same

           24    thing in my room and you can feel the heat coming,

           25    you know, the fan blows the heat.  Hers wasn't


                                                                    37





            1    working.  It just making a bunch of noise.

            2        Q.   For how long was the -- her ceiling heater

            3    not producing heat, if you know?

            4        A.   Maybe -- I don't know when she moved in and

            5    I don't know -- I don't know.  I don't know if it

            6    ever worked.  I told the guy in the building, Tony,

            7    that she -- he put new one in my room.  I said,

            8    "That girl down there needs her thing fixed."  He

            9    said he'll check it out.

           10        Q.   For how long was her ceiling heater making

           11    the noise that you claim it was making?

           12        A.   Any time you walk in there and turn it on.

           13        Q.   When was the first time that you noticed

           14    that her ceiling heater was making noise prior to

           15    the fire?

           16        A.   I don't -- I'm not sure I would hear it,

           17    from my room, going clang, clang, clang, clang,

           18    clang, clang.

           19        Q.   Was it within a few months before the fire

           20    or was it longer than that that you first noticed?

           21        A.   She wasn't there that long, I don't think.

           22    She wasn't there that long, so it may -- before the

           23    fire?  About a month or so.  But that's an estimate.

           24    It's been a long time.

           25        Q.   Do you recall when you first noticed the


                                                                    38





            1    cover to Miss Kessler's ceiling heater looking

            2    melted?

            3        A.   It was -- well, you know, before the fire,

            4    I looked up there and I said, "What the hell did she

            5    do to that?"  But then she couldn't get up there.  I

            6    don't know -- yeah, I remember.  Probably a month or

            7    six weeks, maybe even two months.  I'm not sure how

            8    long she lived there, but it was all beat up.

            9        Q.   Do you recall, a month before the fire,

           10    looking up at the ceiling heater and the ceiling

           11    heater looking melted?

           12        A.   Yeah, it was melted.  But the fan still run

           13    around and made that loud noise, clang, clang,

           14    clang, clang, like it was hitting something.  It was

           15    weird.

           16        Q.   Did Miss Kessler tell that that she had

           17    stopped using the heater prior to the fire, the

           18    ceiling heater?

           19        A.   Did she tell me that?  No, but I told her,

           20    "You better leave that off."  I remember telling her

           21    that, "You better leave that alone."

           22        Q.   And you don't recall if she told you that

           23    she left the ceiling heater off prior to the fire?

           24        A.   I don't recall what?

           25        Q.   You don't recall whether or not she told


                                                                    39





            1    you that she left the ceiling heater off prior to

            2    the fire?

            3        A.   The heater didn't work, so she had to leave

            4    it off.  It was like two switches, one for the fan,

            5    one for the heater, or one is for the light and one

            6    for the heater, something like that.  But it didn't

            7    work so she had no choice but to leave it off.

            8             But the switch I don't know about, but if

            9    she had the switch on, it wasn't bringing no heat,

           10    so I don't know if she left the switch on.  But I

           11    told her, "You better leave that alone."  But it was

           12    cold, it was Christmastime too, so she would be cold

           13    in there.

           14        Q.   Do you know what part of the ceiling heater

           15    was making noise?

           16        A.   I think it was some sort of like metal fan

           17    that's inside of there.  It looked like a metal

           18    piece was like clang, clang, clang, hitting against

           19    something.

           20        Q.   And would that turn on when you would turn

           21    the heat on?

           22        A.   No.  You had like a -- I don't -- one was

           23    the light and one was like the fan.  I'm not sure if

           24    we had two or three switches, but one was like your

           25    heater.  It was all like one unit.


                                                                    40





            1             I don't remember.  You just turned it on

            2    and it would go, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang,

            3    and then I told her, "You better leave it alone,"

            4    so -- she didn't have a light up there either.  It

            5    was -- it was all like melted up there.  It was

            6    weird.  I don't remember the light even working.

            7    But I had a new one so, you know, I remember how it

            8    should look.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hers

            9    didn't work, just made a lot of noise.

           10        Q.   When was the last time that you -- strike

           11    that.

           12             Prior to the fire, do you know the last

           13    time that Miss Kessler actually used the ceiling

           14    heater?

           15             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Calls for

           16    speculation.

           17             THE WITNESS:  The heater didn't work so she

           18    couldn't use it.

           19    BY MS. BACON:

           20        Q.   Was it possible to use the fan and not use

           21    the heater?

           22        A.   It seemed that way, because that's what the

           23    clang, clang, clang noise would be always.  So I

           24    told her, "You better leave that alone," because

           25    there is no heat, no reason to use the little fan.


                                                                    41





            1    It's for heat, to bring the heat, but the heat

            2    didn't work, so I told her, "Leave it alone, better

            3    leave it alone."

            4        Q.   Do you know if the fan and the heater were

            5    told by the same switch?

            6        A.   I don't know.  I don't remember.  Because

            7    you can turn the light on, I remember that, because

            8    I had the same thing.  We all had the same thing.  I

            9    can turn the light on without the heater, so I don't

           10    think it was the same switch, but I'm not sure.

           11        Q.   Did Miss Kessler ever complain to you about

           12    the ceiling heater cover looking melted?

           13        A.   Looking melted?  No.  She said it was cold

           14    in there, though.  She said it was cold -- she was

           15    cold, you know.  It's wintertime.

           16        Q.   So she never mentioned anything to you

           17    about the ceiling heater cover looking melted?

           18        A.   She didn't mention it to me.  I just

           19    looked -- you know, when I go into her room, I said,

           20    "What the hell happened there?  What did you do

           21    there?"

           22             You know, I don't know how she could get up

           23    there.  I don't know what happened.  Looked like

           24    someone melted it with like a welding torch or

           25    something.  It was weird.  I don't know how she did


                                                                    42





            1    it.

            2             But she couldn't have done it.  It just

            3    happened.  It was -- I don't know.  It was weird.

            4    It was like melted thick plastic.  But the thing

            5    still went clang, clang, clang, clang.  I don't

            6    know.

            7        Q.   Did anything else look odd around the

            8    ceiling heater?

            9        A.   No.  It was right in the middle, you know.

           10    They just put them up there.  It's a heater and a

           11    light and maybe a fan.  Might be three switches, but

           12    it was just weird.  I don't know how she did that,

           13    or how it happened.  Because she wasn't there that

           14    long, you know, she didn't live there that long, you

           15    know.  And the places are real close together so we

           16    would go over there and see Lou next door and just

           17    look up.  One time I told her, "What the hell

           18    happened there?"

           19        Q.   And what did she say in response to that

           20    question?

           21        A.   I don't remember.  She -- I don't remember.

           22    I don't remember what she said.

           23        Q.   Other than not having heat and the ceiling

           24    heater making noise, did she mention anything else

           25    to you about problems that she had with the ceiling


                                                                    43





            1    heater?

            2        A.   Said she was cold.

            3        Q.   Okay.  Anything else?

            4        A.   No.

            5        Q.   Is that a "no"?

            6        A.   No, ma'am.  She didn't really say anything.

            7    I'm the one that told her, "What the hell happened

            8    to that," you know.  She just go about her business.

            9        Q.   In 2015, prior to the fire, do you recall

           10    complaining to the manager of the building or the

           11    landlord about any of the problems you were having

           12    with the building --

           13        A.   Oh, yeah --

           14        Q.   -- or your unit?

           15        A.   -- all the time.

           16        Q.   In 2015 specifically?

           17        A.   Yeah, I remember telling Rebecca, you know,

           18    we got bed bugs.  She knew.  We didn't have to tell

           19    her much.  They all knew.

           20        Q.   So is Rebecca the only person that you

           21    told?

           22        A.   She's the only one that was around.

           23        Q.   So the answer is, yes, Rebecca is the only

           24    one you told?

           25             MR. SWENSON:  Specifically with regards to


                                                                    44





            1    management --

            2             THE WITNESS:  To the management?

            3             MR. SWENSON:  -- of the building --

            4             THE WITNESS:  Is that what you mean?

            5             MR. SWENSON:  -- or anyone, period?

            6             THE WITNESS:  I never seen --

            7             MS. BACON:  I'm not talking about other

            8    tenants.  I'm talking anyone --

            9             THE WITNESS:  Oh.

           10             MS. BACON:  Anyone that was a manager of

           11    the building or associated with the owner of the

           12    building.

           13             THE WITNESS:  We just tell Rebecca, you

           14    know, we got bed bugs or whatever, and she would

           15    schedule the guys to come and stuff.  No one else,

           16    no.  There is no one else.

           17    BY MS. BACON:

           18        Q.   Did you ever write a letter or any written

           19    complaint to either Rebecca or to anyone associated

           20    with the owner of the building about issues that you

           21    were having in the building or in your unit?

           22        A.   Write a letter, no, I would just tell her,

           23    you know.  She was my friend and she was the manager

           24    and she had the pizza parlor downstairs, so we would

           25    just tell her, you know.  But she knew.  Everyone


                                                                    45





            1    knew.  There was a lot of bugs in there.

            2        Q.   Did she typically respond --

            3        A.   Yeah.

            4        Q.   -- when you told her about these things?

            5        A.   She'd -- I'm going to take care -- she

            6    would like get the Terminix guy, whatever they call

            7    the pest guys to come over, the best she could.

            8        Q.   You said that the heater worked in your

            9    unit; is that correct?

           10        A.   Yeah.  Yeah, it worked.  I remember I got a

           11    new one, though.  Tony put a new one in.  I don't

           12    know why, but he did and that was cool.  I'm not

           13    sure why he put it in.  So something broke on it,

           14    but I don't remember.  I got a new one.

           15        Q.   There was never a time that the ceiling

           16    heater did not work in your unit, correct?

           17        A.   Not -- except when he replaced it, I think

           18    that's probably why, because the light bulb we could

           19    just screw in.  So I got a new one recently, before

           20    the fire, I remember.

           21        Q.   Do you recall whether or not the one that

           22    you had before it was replaced was -- did you have

           23    an issue with it?

           24        A.   It must have went off, yeah.  I'm not sure.

           25    I know when I turned it on, the termites would come


                                                                    46





            1    out and go around.  But yeah, must have been the

            2    heat because the light bulb I could switch myself.

            3        Q.   Do you recall ever turning your ceiling

            4    heater on and heat not coming out of it?

            5        A.   Yeah, I recall -- I don't remember.  I

            6    don't remember, but I'm sure that's what happened.

            7        Q.   So you don't remember?

            8        A.   I don't remember exactly, no.  I would be

            9    lying if I said I did.

           10        Q.   We don't want you to lie, sir.  You are

           11    under oath.

           12             During your last deposition you talked

           13    about mold in the shower room.  Do you recall that?

           14        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           15        Q.   How long after you observed the mold in the

           16    shower room was the mold removed from the shower

           17    room?

           18             MR. SWENSON:  Objection.  Assumes facts.

           19             THE WITNESS:  Well, I remember Earl and

           20    Steve put some caulking over it.  They didn't remove

           21    it, they just covered it up.  So maybe, you know --

           22    how long?  I would say two weeks they covered it up.

           23    BY MS. BACON:

           24        Q.   Do you know if they actually removed the

           25    mold before they put the new caulking on?

            1        A.   I know they didn't.

            2        Q.   How do you know they didn't?

            3        A.   Because I was -- I live right there.

            4        Q.   Did you see them doing the work?

            5        A.   I kind of walked by and seen them.  Plus

            6    all the mold on the door was still there.  They just

            7    did -- they covered it up with that white, shiny

            8    whatever they call it, stucco stuff or something.

            9        Q.   But you don't know if they actually removed

           10    the mold before they put the caulking --

           11        A.   I know they didn't move it -- remove it.

           12        Q.   Were you there when they were doing the

           13    work?

           14        A.   Yeah.  I was -- I --

           15        Q.   You were standing --

           16        A.   -- was around.

           17        Q.   -- there observing them do the work?

           18        A.   I was around there.  I live right next to

           19    it.  And then I go in the shower every day.  I see

           20    the mold still there where they tried to cover it.

           21        Q.   What do you mean, you could see the mold

           22    still there where they tried to cover it?

           23        A.   Well, they didn't do a good job, so up

           24    there where the tile is, you could see the mold, you

           25    know, and by -- all on the door and stuff.  There


                                                                    48





            1    was mold there.

            2        Q.   The mold on the back of the shower door?

            3        A.   Yeah.  It was a wooden door.

            4        Q.   Was that mold ever removed?

            5        A.   No.  No.  They didn't put a new door on.

            6        Q.   How long was that there?

            7        A.   For the duration, until the fire.

            8        Q.   So from the time that you moved in until

            9    the time of the fire?

           10        A.   Yeah, there was mold in there.

           11        Q.   How do you know it was mold?

           12        A.   Well, I'm just guessing.  It was black and

           13    green and it looked like mold.

           14        Q.   Did you talk to anyone else about the mold

           15    in the shower room?

           16        A.   Yeah, the owner, Mar- -- Big Bird, I call

           17    him, Marty.

           18        Q.   Did you talk to Rebecca about it?

           19        A.   I'm not sure.

           20        Q.   Did you ever take any photographs of the

           21    mold in the shower room?

           22        A.   No.

           23             For what purpose?

           24        Q.   Have you spoken to Miss Kessler since your

           25    last deposition?


                                                                    49





            1        A.   Yeah.  Yes, I have.

            2        Q.   How many times?

            3        A.   I'm not sure.

            4        Q.   More than once?

            5        A.   Oh, yeah.

            6        Q.   More than twice?

            7        A.   Oh, yeah.

            8        Q.   More than five times?

            9        A.   Oh, yeah.

           10        Q.   More than ten times?

           11        A.   When was my last deposition?

           12        Q.   I believe it was in April.

           13        A.   Oh, yeah.  I have spoken to her many times.

           14        Q.   Where is she currently living?

           15        A.   In a car.

           16        Q.   Is she in Santa Monica?

           17        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           18        Q.   Is she not living with a friend?

           19        A.   She was staying in a hotel there on

           20    Arizona, but now she has got a car that -- from

           21    whoever, her sister.  So she'll stay there.  And I

           22    don't know where she stays.  You know, in the car, I

           23    heard.

           24        Q.   Do you have her cell phone number?

           25        A.   Yes, I do.


                                                                    50





            1        Q.   What is it?

            2        A.   Huh?  I can't give up that type of

            3    information.  I would have to ask her.

            4             Right?

            5        Q.   Your counsel is not objecting.

            6             THE WITNESS:  Shall I give her the phone

            7    number?

            8             MR. SWENSON:  That's your decision.

            9             THE WITNESS:  I don't think she want to

           10    talk to anybody.

           11    BY MS. BACON:

           12        Q.   I understand, sir, but you know her, you

           13    talk to her about this case, and I'm asking you --

           14        A.   I ain't talk to --

           15        Q.   -- for her contact information.

           16        A.   No, I don't want -- I will have to ask her

           17    if I can give it to you.

           18        Q.   Sir, your counsel is not instructing you

           19    not to not answer the question.

           20        A.   I don't care what he says.

           21        Q.   So you are refusing to answer my question?

           22        A.   What's the question?

           23        Q.   What is her cell phone number?

           24        A.   I can't give you that.  That's personal

           25    information.  She don't want me to give out her


                                                                    51





            1    number.

            2        Q.   So you are refusing to answer my question?

            3        A.   I'm refusing to give you her number.

            4        Q.   My question is, what is her number, so --

            5        A.   I don't know --

            6        Q.   -- you are refusing to answer my question,

            7    correct?

            8        A.   Yeah.  Yeah, you can't have the number.

            9    Get it from somewhere else.

           10        Q.   What have you discussed with her?

           11        A.   Just day to day, basically what she is

           12    doing.

           13        Q.   Have you talked to her about this case?

           14        A.   No.

           15        Q.   Have you talked to her about the ceiling

           16    heater in her unit?

           17        A.   When?

           18        Q.   Since the fire?

           19        A.   No.

           20        Q.   Have you talked to her about the space

           21    heater in her unit since the fire?

           22        A.   No.  She is goofy.  You just talk to her

           23    about everyday things.  She is a little goofy.  So,

           24    I mean, we're talking about stuff that she couldn't

           25    comprehend.


                                                                    52





            1             MS. MCGRANAHAN:  Can we have that read

            2    back, that last answer.

            3             (Thereupon, the record was read by the

            4             court reporter as follows:  "A.  No.  She

            5             is goofy.  Just talk to her about everyday

            6             things.  She is a little goofy.  So, I

            7             mean, we're talking about stuff that she

            8             couldn't comprehend.")

            9    BY MS. BACON:

           10        Q.   Have you talked to her about conversations

           11    that she has had with other people about the fire?

           12        A.   No.

           13        Q.   No?

           14        A.   No, ma'am.

           15             THE WITNESS:  Cold in here, huh?  Ain't you

           16    cold?

           17             THE REPORTER:  No.

           19             MR. SWENSON:  Is that the air conditioner?

           20             MS. MCGRANAHAN:  It's the server.

           21             Can we take a bathroom break.

           22             MS. BACON:  We can go off the record.

           23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at

            1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the record

            2    at 12:18 p.m.

            3    BY MS. BACON:

            4        Q.   All right.  Welcome back, Mr. McGrath.  You

            5    understand you are still under oath, correct?

            6        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            7        Q.   Those times that you have spoken with

            8    Kristina Kessler since the fire, since your last

            9    deposition, was your counsel present for those

           10    meetings?

           11        A.   No, ma'am.

           12             MS. BACON:  I will go ahead and mark this

           13    next exhibit as 241.

           14             (Exhibit 241 marked.)

           15    BY MS. BACON:

           16        Q.   Okay.  Mr. McGrath, so this document was

           17    produced at the beginning of your last deposition.

           18    My understanding is this is your medical record from

           19    UCLA Health.  Correct?

           20        A.   Yes, ma'am, one of them.

           21        Q.   You had more than this --

           22        A.   I have a lot of records, but go ahead.

           23        Q.   Relating to your treatment after the fire,

           24    is this the only medical record you have or are

           25    there others?


                                                                    54





            1             MR. SWENSON:  Vague and ambiguous as to

            2    "treatment."

            3             THE WITNESS:  After the fire, yeah, this is

            4    the smoke inhalation one.  This should be it.

            5    BY MS. BACON:

            6        Q.   And is this the only time that you were

            7    treated for smoke inhalation after the fire?

            8        A.   Yeah, I believe so.

            9        Q.   And it indicates here that your visit was

           10    on December 15, 2015?

           11        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           12        Q.   So that was three days after the fire,

           13    correct?

           14        A.   I believe so.  The fire was on the 12th.

           15        Q.   Is there a reason you did not go to the

           16    doctor the day after the fire?

           17        A.   Yeah, I was devastated, and I didn't have

           18    my car because the keys burned up.  And it might

           19    have been a Friday or a Thursday, so they are closed

           20    on the weekends.

           21        Q.   Understood.  Okay.

           22             When you went to the doctor on this date,

           23    what did you tell the doctor when you arrived?

           24        A.   I told her that, you know, it's hard to

           25    breathe, a little hard to breathe right now.


                                                                    55





            1        Q.   Did you tell the doctor about the fire?

            2        A.   Oh, yeah.  I'm sure I mentioned it.

            3        Q.   Did you mention to the doctor that you

            4    inhaled smoke as a result of the fire?

            5        A.   They asked me that.  I said, "I'm sure I

            6    did."  Yes, ma'am.

            7        Q.   So it looks like you had a prescription for

            8    Albuterol, an inhaler.  Is that correct?

            9        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           10        Q.   Had you ever been prescribed Albuterol

           11    prior to the fire?

           12        A.   Never.  I don't even know what it was.  The

           13    inhaler, you mean?

           14        Q.   Correct.

           15        A.   Yeah, I never -- I never had that before.

           16        Q.   Did you ever have an inhaler --

           17        A.   Never.  Oops.  Let her finish.  I thought

           18    it was for people with asthma.

           19        Q.   So did you ever have breathing issues prior

           20    to the fire?

           21        A.   No, ma'am.

           22        Q.   How long were you using this inhaler after

           23    you saw the physician on December 15 of 2015?

           24        A.   I just used it until it was empty --

           25        Q.   And how --


                                                                    56





            1        A.   -- so maybe a month.

            2        Q.   Did you pay for this prescription or how

            3    was the prescription covered in terms of cost?

            4        A.   I don't recall.

            5        Q.   Did you have insurance at the time?

            6        A.   I'm sure I did.

            7        Q.   Do you recall if your insurance covered the

            8    prescription?

            9        A.   I'm sure it did.

           10        Q.   What was your insurance at the time?

           11        A.   Obamacare.

           12        Q.   And you didn't get a refill of this

           13    prescription after using it this one time; is that

           14    correct?

           15        A.   I don't recall.  I don't know.  I'm not

           16    sure.  I think I only used the one -- the one that

           17    the lady gave me.

           18        Q.   So you had this prescription filled only

           19    one time, correct?

           20        A.   Yes, I believe so.

           21        Q.   What was this other medication you were on

           22    at the time.  It says "all current medications."

           23    There is one above Albuterol.  Do you recall what

           24    that was for?

           25        A.   I don't even know where it's at, dear.


                                                                    57





            1        Q.   Second page.

            2        A.   Oh, omep- -- that's for like -- omeprazole.

            3    I think it's for heartburn.  Heartburn, yeah,

            4    omeprazole.

            5        Q.   If you go to the last page, there are a

            6    couple of orders here for a CT of chest, and this

            7    looks like it was in March and April of 2015 so that

            8    would have been prior to the fire.  Do you recall

            9    what that's for?

           10        A.   Yeah.  I think I broke some ribs.  I was

           11    riding an electric skateboard at the beach and I ran

           12    into a pole.  That might be that.  I broke like six

           13    ribs, I believe.  Says "x-ray."  Yeah.  I think it

           14    was for that.  I'm not sure, but that sounds about

           15    right.

           16        Q.   Prior to the fire, had you ever had any

           17    examination of your lungs specifically?

           18        A.   I put out a lot of x-rays.  CAT scan.  Of

           19    my lungs?  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.

           20        Q.   Did you rent a U-Haul after the fire?

           21        A.   I did.

           22        Q.   What did you rent a U-Haul for?

           23        A.   To move -- move the stuff, whatever was in

           24    the apartment out of there.

           25        Q.   What did -- how big of a U-Haul did you


                                                                    58





            1    rent?

            2        A.   You know, I'm not even sure if I did rent

            3    one, but I know I got a storage.  I don't think I

            4    rented -- I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I

            5    may not have got -- I got a storage in Venice, I

            6    remember.  I don't know if -- I might have moved in

            7    my Jeep.  I don't remember, to tell you the truth.

            8    I had a storage.  I don't know if I rented a U-Haul.

            9    Some of us did, but I don't know if it was me.  I'm

           10    not sure.

           11        Q.   There were some documents that were

           12    produced which indicate that you did rent a U-Haul.

           13        A.   Then, there it is there.

           14        Q.   So do you recall what you put into the

           15    U-Haul?

           16        A.   I think at most some of the other guys'

           17    stuff that was still good.  For me, I might have put

           18    some clothes that weren't too bad.  I couldn't take

           19    the bed or nothing big, so I don't know why I would

           20    have got the U-Haul.  But probably to help.  They

           21    might have didn't have a credit card or whatever,

           22    some of them guys.

           23        Q.   Do you recall who you helped move or store

           24    things?

           25        A.   We all -- we all went to the storage.  I


                                                                    59





            1    don't know, maybe Lou.  I might have moved some

            2    stuff for Lou, maybe Rick.  I might have helped him

            3    move some stuff because he had nowhere to go.  I'm

            4    not sure.

            5        Q.   Are you claiming the cost of the U-Haul as

            6    damages in this case?

            7             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent that

            8    it calls for a legal conclusion and/or --

            9             THE WITNESS:  I'm sure --

           10             MR. SWENSON:  -- invades attorney-client

           11    privilege.

           12             Go ahead and answer.

           13             THE WITNESS:  I'm sure I would.  Yeah, I

           14    would want them -- someone to pay for it, but it's

           15    already paid for, so I'm not sure.

           16    BY MS. BACON:

           17        Q.   Do you recall how much you paid for the

           18    U-Haul?

           19        A.   Probably like -- I don't recall.  I had the

           20    paper for the storage.  I know I turned them over.

           21             MS. BACON:  Mark this next document as 242

           25        Q.   So this was produced in your document


                                                                    60





            1    production at the beginning of your last deposition.

            2    This is a card from the Santa Monica Police

            3    Department, or appears to be that.  Did you obtain

            4    this from a police officer on the night of the fire?

            5        A.   I don't think so.

            6        Q.   How did you get a copy of this card?

            7        A.   I think we went on top of the pier to see

            8    the Red Cross people or something.  I remember that.

            9    And they was in the police substation, so. . .

           10             MR. SWENSON:  Don't wrinkle that.

           11             THE WITNESS:  Oh, shit.

           12             I don't know.  Might have maybe gave it --

           13    someone gave it to me, I guess.  My name is on

           14    there.  I don't -- I didn't ask no one for it.

           15    Probably something to do with the Red Cross.

           16    BY MS. BACON:

           17        Q.   Do you recall speaking with a police

           18    officer on the night of the fire?

           19        A.   I don't recall.

           20        Q.   Does this reporting officer listed here,

           21    does this name sound familiar to you?  It looks like

           22    Calderon, if I'm reading that correctly.

           23        A.   No.  I don't -- I don't know him.

           24        Q.   Okay.  So you don't recall speaking with

           25    any police officers on the night of the fire?


                                                                    61





            1        A.   No.  No, ma'am.

            2        Q.   Do you recall the names of anyone that you

            3    spoke with from the Red Cross?

            4        A.   Let's think.  That was like four years ago.

            5    I would say no.

            6        Q.   I understand that it was some time ago, but

            7    I'm urging you to dig deep into your memory and let

            8    me know what you recall.

            9        A.   I know they gave us a card with some cash

           10    on it, like an ATM card, $400 for us to get

           11    somewhere to sleep that night, but I don't know the

           12    name of the person.

           13             MS. BACON:  Mark this next exhibit as 243.

           14             (Exhibit 243 marked.)

           15             MS. BACON:  I apologize.  I only have two

           16    copies.  It's Bates-stamped McGrath 000011 through

           17    12 as part of this production.

           18             MR. SWENSON:  Would you give me those Bates

           19    numbers again?

           20             MS. BACON:  Sure.  It's 11 through 12.

           21             MR. SWENSON:  And this is Exhibit 243?

           22             MS. BACON:  Correct.

           23    BY MS. BACON:

           24        Q.   Okay.  Sir, do you recall receiving this

           25    document, or do you recall this document?


                                                                    62





            1        A.   Yeah, I probably asked for it at the

            2    U-Haul -- I mean, the storage in Venice.

            3        Q.   Do you recall what items you put into

            4    storage?

            5        A.   I don't recall.  Probably a bunch of junk,

            6    a bunch of burnt-up stuff.

            7        Q.   So you took all of the burnt stuff out of

            8    your unit and you put it into storage?

            9        A.   No.  I mean --

           10             MR. SWENSON:  Misstates testimony.

           11             THE WITNESS:  -- I don't -- I'm not sure

           12    what I put in there, but I put some stuff in there.

           13    I don't remember.  I took some of my stuff, you

           14    know, the clothes that I wanted, but some of them I

           15    couldn't get the stink out of them so I had to toss

           16    them.  I might have put some stuff for them guys

           17    that really didn't have anywhere to put whatever

           18    they had left, like Rick and them.  They had no

           19    money or nothing, so. . .

           20    BY MS. BACON:

           21        Q.   So you rented a storage unit and you put

           22    other people's belongings in the storage unit?

           23        A.   Yeah, and some of mine, whatever I salvaged

           24    out of there, and some of their stuff so they didn't

           25    have to pay.  Yeah, I remember that, because I told


                                                                    63





            1    them, "You got to get your stuff out of here, money

            2    was time," because I wasn't want to keep paying, you

            3    know.

            4        Q.   Did you get reimbursement from them for the

            5    storage unit that you rented for them?

            6        A.   No, I rented it for me, but I let them put

            7    their stuff in there, you know, because they don't

            8    really have anything money-wise.

            9        Q.   So you rented it for you, but the only

           10    thing you put in there was your clothing?

           11        A.   I had some clothes.  Let me think.  I think

           12    one of my bikes I got over there somehow.  And I had

           13    a lot of clothes in that house, so I lot of it I had

           14    in the back closet covered with a sort of protective

           15    zipper things that you use for your good stuff.  So

           16    I had some clothes, some jerseys -- four or five

           17    jerseys and stuff.  I don't know what else.  Not

           18    much.  The rest probably -- Lou had a lot of like

           19    camera stuff he wanted to salvage.  It was burnt up

           20    though.  I remember it stinked in that storage room.

           21    We had some burnt-up stuff in there stashed.

           22        Q.   Whose writing is on this document?

           23        A.   As far as on the --

           24        Q.   On the first page.

           25        A.   -- back?


                                                                    64





            1             This is me.

            2        Q.   That's your name?

            3        A.   I can see, yeah, that's me adding up my

            4    figures.

            5        Q.   What about the second page?  Is that your

            6    writing as well?

            7        A.   Oh, yeah, that's all me.  Yeah.  Trying to

            8    keep track of this, make sure they didn't clip me

            9    over there at the storage.

           10        Q.   So it says here that you moved out all of

           11    the items in May of 2016.

           12        A.   Damn.

           13        Q.   But I recall that you moved into permanent

           14    housing in February of 2016.  Isn't that correct?

           15        A.   I'm sure I did, yeah.  I got a permanent

           16    pass, a house.

           17        Q.   Is there a reason why you kept your things

           18    in --

           19        A.   It was someone else --

           20        Q.   -- storage until May of 2016?

           21        A.   I think it was someone else's stuff still

           22    in there, you know.

           23        Q.   Was that -- go ahead.

           24        A.   Yeah, I'm sure my stuff was long gone.

           25    Actually, I was -- I made Lou pay me a few dollars


                                                                    65





            1    because he wanted to keep it in there.  He had a lot

            2    of burnt-up equipment.  I remember now.  So he gave

            3    me $30 or something.  Yeah, that's it.  I remember.

            4    So that's why it was still there.  My stuff was out

            5    of there.

            6             Yeah, "If you want to keep the storage

            7    unit, you got to pay," is what I told him.  I

            8    remember, because, you know . . .

            9        Q.   So the last four digits of this card that's

           10    listed on here is 8893.  Is that your card?

           11        A.   Oh, I'm sure it is.

           12        Q.   Do you recall if that's your card?

           13        A.   Let me look, dear.  Yeah.  If my name's --

           14    yeah.

           15        Q.   It's towards the middle of the page under

           16    "payment received."

           17        A.   I'm sure it is my card.  My name is on

           18    there.  Yeah, it's got to be mine.

           19        Q.   There is not a name associated with the

           20    card on here so that's why I'm asking if you recall

           21    if that's your card.

           22        A.   Yeah.  Oh, I don't recall, but I'm -- I

           23    guarantee it is.

           24        Q.   You don't recall but you guarantee it?

           25        A.   Yeah, because that's my name.  They don't


                                                                    66





            1    take payment without your ID and there it all is.  I

            2    wish it wasn't my card, then I wouldn't have the

            3    bill.  But yeah, that's me.  V8.

            4             MS. BACON:  This will be 244, correct?

            5             THE REPORTER:  (No audible response.)

            6             (Exhibit 244 marked.)

            7             THE WITNESS:  What the . . .

            8    BY MS. BACON:

            9        Q.   Okay.  Sir, I will give you a moment to

           10    just look over this document.  But it was produced

           11    in your document production at the beginning of your

           12    last deposition.

           13        A.   I need a magnifying glass for this, dear.

           14        Q.   You can turn through the various pages of

           15    this document.

           16        A.   To look at the pictures?  Got pictures?

           17        Q.   There's no pictures.

           18        A.   Aww.

           19        Q.   It's all text.

           20        A.   I can't really see that, but now I can.

           21        Q.   Do you recall who gave you this document?

           22        A.   No, I don't recall who.  I would imagine it

           23    was Rebecca, but I'm not sure.

           24        Q.   So you think you got this document from

           25    Rebecca?


                                                                    67





            1        A.   Oh, you know what, this might be this

            2    Rosario Perry, some lawyer guy that lives right

            3    over, down by the beach there, has an office.  This

            4    looks -- this might probably look like it's from

            5    him, but I'm not sure.

            6        Q.   The first page -- first and second pages of

            7    this document, where it has the very small text, do

            8    you recall if you pulled this information from

            9    online, yourself, or did someone give it to you?

           10        A.   I don't -- I -- I can't -- I don't even

           11    know what it says, so I -- I don't know.  I'm sure I

           12    didn't pull it from anywhere.

           13        Q.   Did you do any online research after the

           14    fire about the conditions that you were facing after

           15    the fire?

           16        A.   I'm sure the computer burnt up too in the

           17    fire, so no, I couldn't have done it.

           18        Q.   If you turn to McGrath 18, the Bates stamp

           19    at the bottom.

           20        A.   I know that guy.

           21        Q.   Do you know whose handwriting this is on

           22    that page?

           23        A.   Yeah, let me get there.  I don't even know

           24    what am I looking for.  18?

           25        Q.   Right down here in the right-hand corner.


                                                                    68





            1        A.   Shit.  I'm at 30-something.

            2        Q.   Yeah.

            3        A.   Okay.  Here we go.  18, 19.  I speeded up.

            4    This one?  Whose writing is that?

            5        Q.   Correct.

            6        A.   That looks like my raggedy writing.  That's

            7    me.

            8        Q.   Do you recall when you wrote this on this

            9    page?

           10        A.   No, I don't even know what it says,

           11    actually.  "Late equals triple" something, "what

           12    does the relocation fee have to be paid?"  I'm

           13    sorry, what was the question?

           14        Q.   Do you recall why you made this note?

           15        A.   Let me look at it real quick.  "What does

           16    the relocation fee have to be paid within five days

           17    after the tenant moves out.  Late" -- what did you

           18    ask me?

           19        Q.   Do you recall why you made that note on

           20    this page?

           21        A.   I don't recall why, but I'm trying to

           22    figure it out.  Do I recall why?  No, I don't recall

           23    why.

           24        Q.   Do you recall when?

           25        A.   Oh, well, I don't recall, but I'm sure the


                                                                    69





            1    date is on there.  So, I mean, probably as soon as I

            2    got it, whenever that was.  Probably in January

            3    of 2016 maybe, I'm guessing.

            4        Q.   You are guessing but you don't recall

            5    specifically?

            6        A.   I don't know.  The lawyer gave us this

            7    stuff.  We all went to his office, I believe.

            8        Q.   So you made these notes after it was

            9    obviously given to you by Mr. Perry, as you recall,

           10    correct?

           11        A.   No, before -- no, after.  Yes, ma'am.

           12        Q.   If you turn to McGrath 24 --

           13        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           14        Q.   -- is that also your handwriting on that

           15    page?

           16        A.   Oh, that's me.

           17        Q.   And do you recall when you made these

           18    notes?

           19        A.   The same time I made the other ones, but I

           20    don't recall.

           21        Q.   So it was sometime --

           22        A.   Oh, here is the date -- oh, no, that's

           23    12/12, that was the fire, so 4/12.  Sometime after

           24    he gave me the papers, I made them.

           25        Q.   Do you recall how soon after he gave you


                                                                    70





            1    the papers that you made these notes?

            2        A.   No, I surely don't.

            3        Q.   Okay.  If you turn to the next page,

            4    McGrath 25 --

            5        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            6        Q.   -- is that your handwriting in the top

            7    right-hand corner?

            8        A.   Now we are getting a little frisky.  The

            9    U.S. Bank is me.  The 201 SM is me.  The other ones,

           10    I -- the two on the top, 22 over 106, I don't think

           11    that's -- that's not my writing, but the ones

           12    underneath are, the U.S. Bank, the 201 and the SM.

           13    The ones on the top, that's not mine.

           14        Q.   Do you recall why you made this note?

           15        A.   Let me see.  U.S. Bank, 201 Santa Monica.

           16    Oh, that looks like U.S. Bank, 201 Santa Monica

           17    Boulevard.  I think we were supposed to meet the

           18    lawyer over there, Mr. Perry or one of them lawyers,

           19    and they were going to cut us all a check for

           20    something, and we went, and it didn't pan out.  I

           21    remember that.

           22        Q.   And you were paid at a later date, correct?

           23        A.   Correct.

           24        Q.   If you turn to McGrath 33 --

           25        A.   Uh-huh.  Hold up.  34.  Shucks.  I'm there.


                                                                    71





            1        Q.   Is that your handwriting?

            2        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            3        Q.   And why did you make that note?

            4        A.   Let me see.  What's it say?  Well, this

            5    says "fire 12/12," so that's the date of the fire

            6    and the time.  Why?  I'm not sure.  Housing

            7    development -- yeah, I wanted to make sure I knew

            8    what time and day the fire was, to remember, because

            9    this had something to do with the housing people so

           10    I could, you know, tell them what day it was and

           11    what time.  That's why.

           12        Q.   And this was -- were you looking for other

           13    housing during this time frame?  Is that why you

           14    made the note there?

           15             MR. SWENSON:  Vague and ambiguous as to

           16    this time frame?

           17             But you can go ahead and answer.

           18             THE WITNESS:  We were -- I wasn't

           19    looking -- I mean, we were -- what was the question

           20    again?

           21    BY MS. BACON:

           22        Q.   Why did you specifically make the note next

           23    to "housing availability for low-income tenants"?

           24        A.   So I knew when -- so I could tell them when

           25    the fire was and stuff.  I guess we were trying to


                                                                    72





            1    get a -- yeah, we were trying to go to these places,

            2    community over here and some other one.  We were

            3    instructed to go there and try to see if we could

            4    get some sort of housing.  So I put down the date

            5    and the time, so when they asked me, you know, when

            6    it went down, then I had it.

            7        Q.   Who instructed you to go down to see if you

            8    could get housing?

            9        A.   I think it was that Rosario Perry, but I

           10    couldn't be positive.  I don't know who it was.

           11    Yeah, it was probably him, Rosario Perry.

           12        Q.   Do you know if he instructed you about

           13    that?

           14        A.   I'm -- I'm thinking it was him, but I'm not

           15    positive.

           16        Q.   All right.  If you turn to McGrath 43.

           17        A.   Which one, 43?

           18        Q.   43.

           19        A.   Yes, ma'am, hold on.  Oh, yeah.  That's me.

           20        Q.   That's your handwriting?

           21             Do you know what those numbers mean?

           22        A.   I know the 8650 was the relocation amount

           23    and then the -- oh, I was adding up -- the 405 was

           24    from -- sorry -- the people from Red Cross gave us a

           25    card with that money.  The 382, I'm not sure what


                                                                    73





            1    that's -- that's all money that I received and I

            2    added it up.  The 382, I'm not sure where that came

            3    from, but it -- I don't know.  I got to think.

            4        Q.   So this is all the money you received from

            5    various different --

            6        A.   Yeah, the --

            7        Q.   -- sources after the fire, correct?

            8        A.   The 405 for sure.  The 8650 for sure.  I

            9    don't know what the 382 is.  And then underneath,

           10    700 -- but yeah.  Yeah, I got it from somewhere,

           11    yes, ma'am, someone.  Someone.

           12        Q.   So you don't recall what the 700 is for

           13    that you have listed here?

           14        A.   Man, I can't even read my own writing.

           15    700, I would have to say -- I know I got that and

           16    that.  I don't know the 382 or the 700 right

           17    offhand, but if I think I could probably figure it

           18    out.  700.  It says DH or K?  Who gave me the 700?

           19    382.  So we had Red Cross.  We had relocation.  382.

           20    What's 700?  I'm not sure about two of them.  I

           21    don't know where that . . .

           22             Someone gave it to me, bless their hearts.

           23        Q.   The 8650 you got from Mr. Perry, correct?

           24        A.   I believe it was a check from him, yes,

           25    ma'am, Mr. Perry.  Yeah.


                                                                    74





            1             MS. BACON:  Mark this next exhibit as 245.

            2             (Exhibit 245 marked.)

            3             THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

            4    BY MS. BACON:

            5        Q.   All right, sir --

            6        A.   405, yeah.

            7        Q.   -- so this is the money that you received

            8    from the Red Cross, correct?

            9        A.   Yeah, it was like an ATM card, $405.

           10        Q.   And what did you use this money for?

           11        A.   Jeez, I would have to say some food, some

           12    socks and underwear, I recall, and -- let me think.

           13    I think I had to get a key made for my car, the

           14    Jeep.

           15        Q.   Anything else you recall using this money

           16    for?

           17        A.   I bought some socks and underwear, a

           18    toothbrush, that type of thing, cosmetics, you know,

           19    to get started.  Maybe -- and some food, maybe some

           20    gas.  But I'm not sure about the gas.  Some food and

           21    some underwear and socks, and maybe some shoes.

           22    Just the basics.

           23        Q.   Do you recall if you used this card to pay

           24    for the U-Haul or the storage unit?

           25        A.   I -- no, I wouldn't have done that.  I had


                                                                    75





            1    a credit card for the U-Haul -- or the storage unit.

            2    No, I wouldn't use this.  This was for like for

            3    basic essentials, you know, emergencies.

            4        Q.   Is this the only money that you received

            5    from the Red Cross?

            6        A.   Yes.  Yes, ma'am, I believe it is, yes.

            7    Not that I didn't want some more, but it's all they

            8    had.

           11    BY MS. BACON:

           12        Q.   All right, sir, this was also produced in

           13    the production at the beginning of your last

           14    deposition.  Is this your handwriting on these

           15    documents?

           16        A.   This is my handwriting, my name only.

           17        Q.   Whose handwriting is below your name?

           18        A.   I don't know.  I wish I -- I don't write

           19    that nice.  Where is the rest of it?  This is just

           20    it?

           21        Q.   Uh-huh.

           22        A.   Oh, it could be my girl's.  "All receipts

           23    in fire."  I don't --  I'm not sure who wrote it.

           24    It wasn't me, but that's my name.  I wrote that.

           25    Maybe probably -- maybe my girl wrote it for me, put


                                                                    76





            1    them all in order, but I'm not sure.

            2        Q.   It says, "For owner of 1605 Ocean Front

            3    Walk."  Was this ever given to you?

            4        A.   Are we supposed to -- I put my receipts in

            5    a big envelope or something.

            6             I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

            7        Q.   All right.  So this document was created

            8    and you -- did you give this to the owner of the

            9    building with the receipts?

           10        A.   Oh, I don't know if I gave it to him.  I

           11    probably gave it to my attorneys, I would imagine.

           12        Q.   Why does it say "for owner of" with a

           13    colon, "for 1605 Ocean Front Walk"?

           14        A.   Why does it say that?

           15             MR. SWENSON:  Objection to the extent that

           16    it calls for speculation.

           17             THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  So he can --

           18             MR. SWENSON:  And he testified that he --

           19             THE WITNESS:  -- pay it --

           20             MR. SWENSON:  -- doesn't think he wrote it.

           21             THE WITNESS:  -- I guess.  I don't know.

           22    For the owner, they wanted the receipts.  I think

           23    they asked for the receipts for, you know --

           24    somebody asked for them.  Oh, they told us to save

           25    all our receipts, you know, when we had to go get


                                                                    77





            1    underwear and socks and toothpaste and U-Haul.

            2    "Save your receipts," I remember someone said.

            3    BY MS. BACON:

            4        Q.   Who told you --

            5        A.   Maybe Rosario Perry.  Maybe these people.

            6        Q.   So someone told you to save your receipts

            7    but you don't recall who, correct?

            8        A.   Yeah.  I don't recall who but someone

            9    definitely said, "Save all of your receipts.  You

           10    might need them."

           11        Q.   Do you recall ever giving those receipts to

           12    the owner or to the manager of the building?

           13        A.   No.  I wouldn't give -- no, I don't -- no.

           14    I don't recall.

           15        Q.   There is a number on the second page.  Do

           16    you know whose number this is?

           17        A.   I'm trying to look for the receipts,

           18    because I sure gave them to someone.  Oh, whose

           19    number?  No, that's not my writing either, but --

           20    no, I don't know.  That's -- maybe -- I don't know

           21    whose number.

           22        Q.   You don't know whose number?

           23        A.   No.  That's not my writing.

           24             MS. BACON:  Sorry, Denise, we are

           25    overlapping on each other.

            2    BY MS. BACON:

            3        Q.   All right, sir.  So this document was

            4    produced to us at the beginning of your last

            5    deposition.

            6        A.   What the hell?  Uh-huh.

            7        Q.   Did you make copies of these cards like

            8    this?

            9        A.   I would have to say I don't know.  I don't

           10    know.  I don't even know what all this is.  I know

           11    that Raven, he used to live in the building, and I

           12    know that's my next appointment, so that's me and

           13    that's my ID, some insurance card, and the pest

           14    control.  I'm not sure if I made copies but I'm

           15    familiar with some of this.  This is my writing

           16    here.

           17        Q.   The number, the phone number that's

           18    written?

           19        A.   Yeah.  The same one on the other paper, but

           20    I didn't write this number.  Writing on the other

           21    paper.

           22        Q.   Okay.  So why don't we start from the top

           23    then.  Whose number is this that you have written

           24    here?

           25        A.   Oh, I don't know.  We would have to call


                                                                    79





            1    it.  Looks like 8 -- 1-800 number or something.

            2        Q.   And it looks like there is an appointment

            3    card here for Western Dental.  Is there a reason why

            4    you included an appointment card for Western Dental?

            5        A.   I don't have no idea, but that's my -- my

            6    appointment for myself, I know that.  I don't even

            7    know why that's there.

            8        Q.   You didn't see a dentist as a result of

            9    anything relating to the fire, correct?

           10        A.   Well, I -- correct.

           11             MR. SWENSON:  Counsel, could we take a

           12    brief break.  He has to feed --

           13             THE WITNESS:  Is it 1:00 already?

           14             MR. SWENSON:  -- the meter in the car.

           15    It's 12:54 and his meter expires at 12:59.

           16             MS. BACON:  Okay.  That's fine.

           17             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at 12:54.

           22        Q.   Welcome back.  Sir, you understand you are

           24        A.   Yes, ma'am.

           25        Q.   Who is this Brian Gallow, the driving


                                                                    80





            1    instructor indicated here on McGrath 69?

            2        A.   I have no idea.

            3        Q.   So you don't know why this is on this page?

            4        A.   No, ma'am.

            5        Q.   And this is your insurance identification

            6    card on this page?

            7        A.   Well, let's look here.  Yeah, that's me,

            8    422 --

            9        Q.   And this is for your vehicle?

           10        A.   I don't know what vehicle.  I can't see --

           11    oh, there's my name.  Yeah, that's me.  Yeah, that's

           12    my vehicle.

           13        Q.   Is there a reason why you produced a copy

           14    of your auto insurance card?

           15        A.   There must be a reason but I don't know

           16    what it is.

           17        Q.   Have you talked to Raven Blackwing since

           18    the fire?

           19        A.   I seen Raven at the 99 Cents store.  I seen

           20    him twice, actually.  So yeah, I have talked to him.

           21        Q.   And he was your neighbor; is that correct?

           22        A.   He lived in the building but not next to

           23    me.

           24        Q.   Which unit did he live in?

           25        A.   Shit.  He lived in I forget what was the


                                                                    81





            1    number.  He lived in the front, No. 1, maybe, or 2.

            2    Right there in the front coming up the stairs.  I

            3    lived way in the back.

            4        Q.   Then there is a Dewey Pest Control card

            5    here and the name on it is Omar Angel Soria.  Why do

            6    you have a copy of this Dewey Pest Control card?

            7        A.   When you ask why, I don't even remember

            8    printing this out to begin with, but if I did, I

            9    don't know why I would have Raven's picture.  But

           10    this guy probably came and sprayed for bed bugs or

           11    termites or roaches.  If it -- what's the address?

           12    Yeah, yeah, Santa Monica.

           13        Q.   So you recall this person coming out to the

           14    building to spray for what, exactly?

           15        A.   I don't remember at all, dear.  I don't

           16    even remember this piece of paper.  I'm just saying.

           17        Q.   Do you remember talking to someone from

           18    Dewey Pest Control and getting a card from them?

           19        A.   I talked to those guys that have been in

           20    the building before just to maybe gave them a drink

           21    and stuff, a Gatorade or water or whatever, but I

           22    don't remember getting a card, but -- I don't know.

           23        Q.   Do you recall if Dewey Pest Control

           24    performed a service in your unit in the building?

           25    Did they treat for anything in your unit?


                                                                    82





            1        A.   We have had the -- what do they call them?

            2    What do they call them companies?  We have had those

            3    companies come in the building, yeah.  I don't know

            4    if it was Dewey or Terminix or -- yeah, they have

            5    been in my building, they have been in my unit, yes,

            6    ma'am.

            7        Q.   Do you recall what they did in your unit?

            8        A.   They would -- well, depends what time.  The

            9    bed bugs, we had to take everything outside and put

           10    it outside and stay out there all day.  And I guess

           11    they -- I don't know what they did.  But sometimes

           12    they will come in and spray for roaches in the

           13    building.  You move your stuff away from the edges

           14    type of thing and cover up your dishes and food and

           15    stuff.  So they would spray -- for termites they

           16    came once, and roaches many times and bed bugs.

           17    Yeah, they been there.

           18        Q.   Do you know if any of the other tenants in

           19    the building smoked weed?

           20        A.   A lot of them fools smoke weed.

           21        Q.   Who?

           22        A.   I mean -- oh, I can't give up that

           23    information, ma'am.  No.  Do I know if they smoked

           24    weed?  I smelled weed in the building.

           25        Q.   Do you know specifically who was smoking


                                                                    83





            1    weed?

            2        A.   Well, specifically, I think all of them

            3    smoked weed except maybe me and Liz and I should --

            4    and Tony didn't smoke weed.  I don't think the girl

            5    smoked weed, what's her name, Kristina.

            6             MR. SWENSON:  Don't --

            7             THE WITNESS:  Lou didn't --

            8             MR. SWENSON:  -- guess or speculate.

            9             THE WITNESS:  -- smoke weed.

           10             MR. SWENSON:  Just what you know.

           11             THE WITNESS:  Who smoked weed?  Rick smoked

           12    weed.  Samson smoked weed.  D. smoked weed.  A lot

           13    of them smoked weed.  I don't know if they smoked in

           14    the building but they were weed smokers.

           15    BY MS. BACON:

           16        Q.   Did you see any of the other tenants doing

           17    any other drugs in the building?

           18        A.   No, ma'am.

           19        Q.   Where was Lenny or Lennox Varnedoe's door

           20    in relation to Kristina Kessler's door?

           21        A.   She was down the hall and he was -- he

           22    was -- he was one -- I mean, she was in the corner

           23    and he was over here in the hallway.

           24        Q.   So he was down the hallway from where her

           25    unit was?


                                                                    84





            1        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            2        Q.   Do you recall knocking on Lenny's door

            3    before you left the building after noticing the

            4    fire?

            5        A.   I don't recall, but I'm sure I knocked on

            6    all the doors.  I may not have knocked on Lou's

            7    because it turns out he was in there.  Oh, Lenny's

            8    door?  I'm sure I knocked on his door.

            9        Q.   So after you noticed the fire, you went

           10    down the hallway to knock on doors?

           11        A.   I ran down to get the fire pan -- I get a

           12    pan out of my house to bust the fire extinguisher

           13    because the glass was broke right there and I didn't

           14    want to get cut.  And then too much smoke and then

           15    someone grabbed me and said I can't go down there.

           16        Q.   So when did you knock on doors?

           17        A.   After that.

           18        Q.   You went down the hallway after that to

           19    knock on doors?

           20        A.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then, you

           21    know, there was -- Wendy and every -- D. and them,

           22    the smoke was starting to come through toward the

           23    front and so they all knew -- and then what's his

           24    name, Erik Pena, he grabbed the old lady and stuff.

           25    I remember.  Yeah, I knocked on some doors, a few


                                                                    85





            1    that I could, and then, you know, those guys knew so

            2    they were coming this way, so everyone knew by then,

            3    yeah.

            4        Q.   After the fire did you ever stay with a

            5    friend instead of staying in a hotel?

            6        A.   Yeah, yeah, yeah.

            7        Q.   During what period of time after the fire,

            8    before you found permanent housing, did you stay

            9    with a friend?

           10        A.   Come again?

           11        Q.   So after the fire occurred, before you

           12    found your permanent housing in February of 2016,

           13    during what period in there did you stay with a

           14    friend?

           15        A.   I would stay at Little Mikey's with Lou.

           16    Lou stayed there.  I stayed maybe a couple weeks.

           17    You know, I don't want to be a burden but -- and Lou

           18    was his buddy, so I kind of just weaseled on in.

           19    Stayed a couple weeks.  I would say it was January.

           20        Q.   Any other friend's house that you stayed

           21    at?

           22        A.   I stayed in the Jeep a few nights, you

           23    know.  I might have stayed at my girl's once or

           24    twice.

           25        Q.   Is there a reason why you didn't stay at


                                                                    86





            1    her house more frequently --

            2        A.   My girl's?

            3        Q.   -- after the fire?

            4             Yes.

            5        A.   She lives in LA.  It was kind of far and,

            6    you know, I wanted to be amongst the other guys, you

            7    know, from the fire, kind of stick together and

            8    figure out where we are going to stay and what we

            9    are going to do.  Plus, we was fighting.

           10        Q.   Did you want to move back into your unit

           11    after the fire?

           12        A.   After the fire?  You mean, if they fixed

           13    it?

           14        Q.   Right.

           15        A.   Oh, yeah.  I like it at -- it's a good

           16    location.

           17        Q.   Did you like the building?

           18        A.   The building was raggedy, but the location

           19    was the bomb.  But, you know, you got to make due.

           20        Q.   Did you ever talk with Larry

           21    Pulling [phonetic] about any complaints he had made

           22    to the health department?

           23        A.   Did I talk to him about it?  Larry, he

           24    talked a lot, like myself.  I might -- he might have

           25    mentioned some stuff but I couldn't recall.


                                                                    87





            1        Q.   You don't recall?

            2        A.   I couldn't recall, but I -- he might have

            3    said something.  Yeah, he is like that.  He will --

            4    most of us wouldn't go to the health department and

            5    do -- you know.  He -- he will do that type of

            6    stuff.  I don't recall if I ever talked to him about

            7    that, dear.  It was a lot of mumbo-jumbo for

            8    nothing.

            9        Q.   Do you recall him telling you at one point

           10    that he reported something to the health department

           11    regarding the building?

           12        A.   I believe I can -- he said something about

           13    something.  I would -- yeah, he would ramble on like

           14    myself.

           15        Q.   Do you recall how long before the fire that

           16    was, before the fire?

           17        A.   Do I recall?  No.  I'm just trying to think

           18    of what he said.

           19        Q.   Did you ever talk with Jere Hawkins about

           20    any issues he had with the building or his unit?

           21        A.   You mean Jerry that died?

           22        Q.   Correct.

           23        A.   No, we didn't talk much.  I mean, I would

           24    see him, we'd say hi, that's all.

           25        Q.   So you never talked to him about any issues


                                                                    88





            1    he had with his unit or the building?

            2        A.   No, no.  We weren't on that page.

            3        Q.   Do you know what appliances Miss Kessler

            4    had in her unit besides her space heater?

            5        A.   She didn't have nothing in there.  A pan of

            6    mine that was dirty, she borrowed and never cleaned

            7    it.  She really didn't have nothing.

            8        Q.   You don't -- do you recall if she had a

            9    refrigerator in her unit?

           10        A.   I don't recall.  She may have had a little

           11    one but I couldn't be -- I'm not sure.

           12        Q.   Do you recall if she had a hot plate in her

           13    unit?

           14        A.   She had -- I don't recall, but she must

           15    have.  She borrowed a pan many times, so I didn't --

           16    I'm sure she had something in there.

           17        Q.   Do you recall if she had a toaster oven in

           18    her unit?

           19        A.   I'm not sure.

           20        Q.   Did you ever hang out inside of her unit?

           21        A.   Well, it was a little raggedy.  I would

           22    stand by the door there.  You know, I wouldn't

           23    really go in.  There was a lot of stuff in there.

           24    You know, it wasn't the cleanest.

           25        Q.   You previously testified that the space


                                                                    89





            1    heater that was in Miss Kessler's unit came from

            2    you.  Do you recall that testimony?

            3        A.   No, but I recall her picking it up and

            4    walking out of my room with it one day.

            5        Q.   Do you recall when that was, that she took

            6    a space heater from your unit?

            7        A.   Before the fire.  I'm not sure when.

            8    Maybe -- maybe a month before.

            9        Q.   Do you know what she did with the space

           10    heater that she took from your unit?

           11        A.   She probably plugged it in and got warm,

           12    tried to warm herself at night.  It was cold.  It

           13    was December.  Had a lot of holes in the windows and

           14    shit and the breeze.  I'm sure she plugged it in.  I

           15    don't know where but it was in there somewhere.

           16        Q.   Do you know for a fact that that space

           17    heater was in her units?

           18        A.   Well, I know she took it from mine and

           19    walked on, yeah.  Yeah, it was in there.  For a

           20    fact, no, but I'm 99.9 percent sure that's where it

           21    was, where she took it.

           22        Q.   Where did you get that space heater from?

           23        A.   I'd have to say I like to get them at

           24    Salvation Army boutique or just the Salvation Army,

           25    or the Goodwill on 5th street.


                                                                    90





            1        Q.   So the conviction that you had for

            2    attempted burglary, what were the circumstances of

            3    that case?  What happened?

            4        A.   I think they found my fingerprints on the

            5    window over there in Culver City or something.  An

            6    alarm got sent off, and about a few weeks later they

            7    picked me up.

            8        Q.   And it was a window to what?

            9        A.   A business.

           10        Q.   What type of business?

           11        A.   I'm not sure.

           12        Q.   You don't recall the business?

           13        A.   I don't even recall being over there and

           14    putting the prints on the window, but they said they

           15    had them.

           16        Q.   You mentioned there were times that your

           17    electricity went out because you were using more

           18    than one appliance.  Do you recall that testimony?

           19        A.   Yes, I do.

           20        Q.   Okay.  And in those times that that

           21    happened, when your electricity went out because you

           22    were using more than one appliance, what did you do?

           23        A.   Cried.  No.  I -- what did I do?  I don't

           24    remember.  I would go down to the end of the hall

           25    and hit the switch.


                                                                    91





            1        Q.   So you would flip the breaker back,

            2    correct?

            3        A.   Yes, ma'am.

            4        Q.   How many times did you do that during the

            5    time that you were living in the building?

            6        A.   Amount of times I did it?  Not that many.

            7    I would say -- shit.  Because I learned not to run

            8    this with that.  Maybe, I would say, at the most,

            9    ten times, maybe closer to five.  About five or ten

           10    times I had to flick it.

           11        Q.   Did anyone else ever go and flip the

           12    breaker for you?

           13        A.   No, I don't think -- Tony might have done

           14    it once because I didn't know how to do it, but --

           15    but I'm not sure.  He is like the electrician for

           16    the building type.

           17        Q.   Is that the only issue that you had with

           18    the electricity, was when you would use more than

           19    one appliance at the time?

           20        A.   You mean to blow the fuse, the power?

           21        Q.   Yes.

           22        A.   Yeah, that's -- the electricity, yeah,

           23    that's the only time.  I got termites blowing out of

           24    my little heater though, but . . .

           25        Q.   Yeah.  We talked about that last time.


                                                                    92





            1        A.   Yeah.  I didn't know what they were.

            2    Little red bug -- red wings or something.  What the

            3    hell?

            4        Q.   So you said you learned not to use certain

            5    things together.  What did you learn not to use

            6    together?

            7        A.   Like the microwave and the flat screen, it

            8    might blow the power.  We only had like one outlet

            9    in each little room.

           10        Q.   During your last deposition you mentioned

           11    you had a TV, a mini refrigerator --

           12        A.   Yeah.

           13        Q.   -- and a microwave in your unit.  Did you

           14    have any other appliances in your unit?

           15        A.   I had a toaster oven, yes, ma'am, and I had

           16    a hot plate also.

           17        Q.   And what did you plug in at the same time?

           18    Did you have an extension cord?

           19        A.   Extension cord?  No.  I had one of those

           20    big thick ones that hold like four or five items.

           21        Q.   So you had a power are strip, correct?

           22        A.   Yeah, I had one of those in there.

           23        Q.   What did you have plugged into the power

           24    strip?

           25        A.   Well, the plugs were right by the door, so


                                                                    93





            1    the strip would run around the wall.  I had the TV

            2    in there always, and then whatever I was going to

            3    cook, I would plug in.  I wouldn't leave them

            4    plugged in, because, you know.

            5        Q.   Did you leave the mini fridge plugged in

            6    with the TV?

            7        A.   Yeah, yeah.  The mini fridge stayed on.

            8    And the rest I had to kind of go -- if I was going

            9    to cook, like I might want to use the hot plate, and

           10    then I would plug something else in.  But yeah, the

           11    fridge and TV stayed plugged in.

           12        Q.   So what else stayed plugged in, besides the

           13    TV and the mini fridge?

           14        A.   I think I had a cable box, because I

           15    remember I had to pay them even though I didn't live

           16    there.  I might have had a little stereo.

           17        Q.   Did Rebecca ever go into your unit?

           18        A.   Yeah.

           19        Q.   Did she ever tell you that you shouldn't be

           20    using that many appliances in the power strip at the

           21    same time?

           22        A.   Her?  No, but the fireman came through

           23    before.  You know, they come in once a month or once

           24    a year and check --

           25        Q.   And the firemen told you that you shouldn't


                                                                    94





            1    be plugging in that many things at once?

            2        A.   Well, they didn't tell me that because they

            3    didn't come in my unit, but I've heard them talking

            4    down the hall, you know, you don't want to run a

            5    bunch of stuff at once.  They didn't really come in

            6    my house.

            7        Q.   When do you recall the first time hearing

            8    the fireman say that more than one thing should not

            9    be plugged in at a time or be used in a power strip?

           10             MR. SWENSON:  Misstates testimony.

           11             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, they -- they didn't say

           12    one thing.  They said you don't want to run a bunch

           13    of wires around or something.  I don't know.

           14    Maybe -- they came once a year, so I seen some guys

           15    in there checking the extinguishers.  They say --

           16    what was the question, when?

           17    BY MS. BACON:

           18        Q.   Uh-huh.  When was the first time you recall

           19    that happening?

           20        A.   I don't know.  I'm not -- two

           21    thousand-something.

           22        Q.   About the time that you first moved into

           23    the building?

           24        A.   I seen them -- you know, I would see them

           25    once in a while up there.  I don't know when it was.


                                                                    95





            1    Maybe a couple years I was there and they would come

            2    by.  Then there would be another guy doing the

            3    extinguishers, just -- he didn't work for the fire

            4    department.  He'd be switching those.  Once a year

            5    he would check them.  But yeah, I remember they said

            6    something about, don't have all that stuff plugged

            7    in, you know, you can't do that.  I don't remember

            8    the date.

            9             See ya.

           10             MS. BACON:  Okay.  I think that I'm done

           11    for now.  I would just reserve the right, in the

           12    event that anything changes in terms of his

           13    testimony or further documents are produced that

           14    require further examination, that we would reserve

           15    the right to question him with respect to those

           16    matters.

           17             THE WITNESS:  Do you want the phone number

           18    now?  (Inaudible.)

           19    BY MS. BACON:

           20        Q.   I would like Miss Kessler's phone number.

           21    Are you going to give it to me based off of my last

           22    question?

           23        A.   I will give it to you.

           24        Q.   Okay.  What's Miss Kessler's name?

           25        A.   Oh, shit.  I got to get it off -- let me


                                                                    96





            1    get it.  Let me get the phone, see if it charged.

            2    Let's see if it will work here.  Let me see.  It's

            3    usually not this slow.  That's why my girl say, "Buy

            4    a computer."  I say, "You say that every time."

            5             But I will get it to you.  Right now I'll

            6    let it warm up.  I'm surprised you-all don't have

            7    it.  But here we go.  Want to trade?  I got this for

            8    31 bucks.  Oh, yeah.  This is my baby.  Here we go.

            9    Oh.  All right.  Let me get it, dear.

           10             Christine, the number.  Contacts.  Bam.

           11    Bam.  Her number will be as follows:

           12    (484) 373-1167.

           13        Q.   Thank you, sir.

           14        A.   Mobile.  Yeah.

           15             MS. BACON:  Okay.

           16             THE WITNESS:  Don't tell her you got it

           17    from me.  No, it's all right.

           18             MS. BACON:  Do you have anything?

           19             MR. SWENSON:  Just real quick.

           20                         EXAMINATION

           21    BY MR. SWENSON:

           22        Q.   Mr. McGrath, do you know who was living in

           23    the unit occupied by Kristina Kessler before the

           24    fire, before she moved in, rather?

           25        A.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Eddie.


                                                                    97





            1    Raven's son.

            2        Q.   Raven's son.

            3        A.   Yeah.

            4        Q.   Okay.  Real quick, we won't go over the

            5    minute.

            6             And then my question is, did you observe

            7    the ceiling heater in that unit, unit 8, when Eddie

            8    was living there?

            9        A.   Yeah.  It was all right then.  I mean, I

           10    was over at Eddie's now and then.  I didn't see

           11    nothing.  It was just like --

           12        Q.   Did you ever see the ceiling heater in

           13    Kristina's unit when she was living there, when it

           14    wasn't melted; in other words; do you know that that

           15    happened while she was living there, or could it

           16    have been there when she moved?

           17             MS. BACON:  Objection to the extent it's

           18    leading.

           19             THE WITNESS:  It was fine before she got

           20    there, I believe, because, you know -- well,

           21    actually, Raven rented it out to her on a sublease,

           22    so I was thinking they would have switched

           23    everything, made it nice and fancy.  But yeah, Eddie

           24    wouldn't have went for that.  It was fine until she

           25    moved in.  And I don't know what she did or what


                                                                    98





            1    happened, but it was raggedy then.

            2             MS. BACON:  Do we have to change the tape?

            3             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  If we are going to keep

            4    going.

            5             MS. BACON:  Yeah.  We have to -- still have

            6    to put a stipulation on the record.

            7             MR. SWENSON:  Off the record.

            8             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This concludes today's

            9    proceeding in the deposition of Christopher McGrath,

           10    Volume II.

           11             THE WITNESS:  Who?

           12             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The number of media used

           13    was one.

           14             MS. BACON:  No.

           15             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are off the record at

           16    1:24 p.m.

           17             (Off the record.)

           18             THE REPORTER:  You can stipulate, but we're

           19    going to go by code.

           20             MS. BACON:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.

           21             The parties will stipulate to relieve the

           22    court reporter of her duties under the Code of Civil

           23    Procedure.  The original transcript will be sent

           24    with a pre-stamped FedEx envelope to the deponent's

           25    counsel, who will then send it to Mr. McGrath for


                                                                    99





            1    his review.  He will have five days to review and

            2    sign transcript.  If it is not signed within five

            3    days, then it will be assumed that everything in the

            4    transcript is accurate.  At the conclusion of five

            5    days, counsel for the deponent will send the

            6    original transcript back to my office, informing my

            7    office of any changes to the deposition, and my

            8    office will retain possession.  If the original is

            9    lost, destroyed or otherwise unavailable, then a

           10    certified copy of the transcript can be used in its

           11    place and will be lodged upon request for any future

           12    hearing or trial in this matter.

           13             So stipulated?

           14             MR. SWENSON:  I request five business days.

           15             MS. BACON:  Oh.  We haven't been doing that

           16    before.

           17             MR. SWENSON:  I haven't had a five-day

           18    turnaround.

           19             THE WITNESS:  We are now, sister.  We

           20    are -- oh.

           21             MS. BACON:  I guess we don't currently have

           22    a trial date, so five business is fine.  I will

           23    agree to that.

           24             THE REPORTER:  Five business days for?

           25             MS. BACON:  For him to review and sign the

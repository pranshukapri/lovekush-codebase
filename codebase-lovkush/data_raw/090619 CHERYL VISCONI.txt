          17   years at Northeast, or had you taught at

          18   other schools?

          19   A.     15 years at Northeast High School.

          20   One year I was at Sharswood Elementary and

          21   Prince Hall Elementary in the same year.

          22   Q.     Did you solely teach Spanish classes

          23   at Northeast High School?

                                                            7



           1   Q.     Was that a full-time job with the

           2   school district?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     What was your salary in January of

           5   2019?

           6   A.     I'm on a Step 11; $83,250

           7   approximately.

           8   Q.     Did you work in a classroom by

           9   yourself, or did you have aides in your

          10   classrooms?

          11   A.     I worked in the classroom by myself.

          12   Q.     What grades did you teach?

          13   A.     Mostly 9th and 10th graders.  Mostly

          14   9th graders this past year.

          15   Q.     What floor of the building did you

          16   work on?

          17   A.     The first floor.

          18   Q.     Did you always work in the same

          19   classroom?

          20   A.     No.  In that building, over the years,

          21   I've traveled.  I was in about 21 different

          22   rooms over my history.  In the last year, I

          23   traveled to three different rooms.

          24   Q.     Were those all on the first floor?

                                                            8



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     Where were you working on January 2,

           3   2019?

           4   A.     I was working in Room 150 on the first

           5   floor when the incident occurred.

           6   Q.     How would you characterize the student

           7   body at Northeast High School?

           8   A.     It's a typical Philadelphia school.

           9   Q.     Were there security measures in the

          10   school in terms of the kids coming and going

          11   from the school?

          12   A.     In the morning, during entry, there

          13   are portable metal detectors put in place;

          14   one or two at the front door for the girls

          15   entry, and two others at back doors where the

          16   boys would enter.

          17   Q.     Were all the students supposed to go

          18   through the metal detectors?

          19   A.     Yes, they are all supposed to go

          20   through the metal detectors, to my knowledge.

          21   Q.     Were there doors in addition to the

          22   entrance doors where the metal detectors were

          23   where kids could come and go from the school?

          24   A.     There are many other doors that enter

                                                            9



           1   into the school around the perimeter of the

           2   building, yes.

           3   Q.     When you say many, can you give us a

           4   broad estimate?

           5   A.     20 to 30.

           6   Q.     Are these doors open to the public?

           7   A.     They are locked from the outside.

           8   Again, to my knowledge, they are locked from

           9   the outside.

          10   Q.     Can they be opened by a student in the

          11   hallway?

          12   A.     They can be.

          13   Q.     Did you observe students ever coming

          14   through those doors with other students

          15   allowing them in?

          16   A.     I have, yes.

          17   Q.     Describe for us your classroom at Room

          18   150.

          19   A.     In Room 150, I had one entry door.  I

          20   guess it's a room -- I don't know -- 20-by-30

          21   or so.  It's a rectangular room.  The windows

          22   had bars on them, stationary bars, gradings,

          23   because it's on the first floor.  The door to

          24   the room that particular day and for days

                                                           10



           1   prior is missing the glass piece that would

           2   have allowed me to -- I could lock the door,

           3   but not having the glass in place would allow

           4   anybody, even if the door were locked, to put

           5   their hand in the door and open the door.

           6   The room is well-lighted.

           7   Q.     Is there only one entrance/egress,

           8   that door that you discussed?

           9   A.     Yes, there's just one entry door.

          10   Q.     Can you get out through the windows,

          11   or are they barred?

          12   A.     They were barred.  That day I remember

          13   the police officers, when they finally came

          14   barrelling through, looked and commented

          15   about how we tried to barricade it with the

          16   lock.  The one officer said --

          17               MS. GRANT:  Objection, hearsay.

          18   BY MR. HUTTEMANN:

          19   Q.     We don't need to get into that right

          20   now.

          21   A.     He just said you could die in here.

          22               MS. GRANT:  Objection, hearsay.

           1   Q.     Were there doors to the outside

           2   proximate to the entrance to that classroom?

           3   A.     Yes, there is one door looking out

           4   from the doorway itself, and I can look out.

           5   It's about 20 feet of the doorway entry for

           6   the classroom.

           7   Q.     Did you ever observe students coming

           8   in and out of those doors?

           9   A.     I have.

          10   Q.     Was there an incident that occurred on

          11   January 2, 2019 at Northeast High School?

          12   A.     Yes, there was.

          13   Q.     What time of the day?

          14   A.     It was about 11:15.  It was the 4th

          15   period.

          16   Q.     You had indicated that there was no

          17   glass in the door on that date; is that

          18   correct?

          19   A.     That's correct.

          20   Q.     I'm going to show you a photograph

          21   that's going to be marked as C-Visconi-1.

          22          Can you tell us who took this picture?

          23   A.     I took this picture at the end of the

          24   year.

           1   Q.     What does this depict?

           2   A.     This depicts the door to Room 150 that

           3   I was working in, the door without the glass.

           4   Q.     Was this the condition of the door on

           5   January 2, 2019?

           6   A.     Yes.  To the best of my knowledge,

           7   yes.

           8   Q.     I'm going to show you what's marked as

           9   C-Visconi-2, another photograph.

          10          Can you tell us what that depicts.

          11   A.     That depicts, from the doorway of 150,

          12   the proximity of one of the outside doors.

          13   Q.     When you say the outside doors, is

          14   that the red door that you can see in the

          15   photograph?

          16   A.     That's the red door we can see in the

          17   photograph.  That is a double-door system.

          18   Q.     Did you take this photograph from

          19   standing inside the door or outside the door

          20   for classroom 150?

          21   A.     I took it in the portal of the door

          22   itself.

          23   Q.     On the left, there is a doorknob on

          24   that photograph.

                                                           13



           1          Is that doorknob the doorknob for

           2   classroom 150?

           3   A.     Yes, it is.

           4   Q.     Did you take this photograph, ma'am?

           5   A.     I took this one, too.

           6               MR. HUTTEMANN:  I'm going to

           7   enter into evidence C-Visconi-1 and -2.

           8               Any objection?

           9               MS. GRANT:  No objection.

          10               When were they taken?

          11               MR. HUTTEMANN:  She said at the

          12   end of the year.

          13               MS. GRANT:  Previous school area?

          14               THE WITNESS:  June.

          15   BY MR. HUTTEMANN:

          16   Q.     What happened on January 2nd?

          17   A.     I went to Room 150.  The bell rang.  I

          18   went to 150 to start a regular 4th period.  I

          19   don't remember.  10, 15 minutes, all of a

          20   sudden -- and I don't remember if I heard

          21   lock down or shelter in place.  I don't

          22   remember what was said.  I don't remember who

          23   said it on the PA system.

          24          I just knew one of the procedures is

                                                           14



           1   to lock the door, and I really just couldn't

           2   lock the door.  I didn't know if it was a

           3   drill, or I didn't know what was going on.

           4   Q.     Were there students in the classroom?

           5   A.     There were students in the classroom

           6   because we were in for a few minutes already.

           7   They were already in the classroom.  I just

           8   directed them to go against the wall which

           9   was farthest from the window on the opposite

          10   side.

          11          They all gathered.  They went over.

          12   They were pretty quiet, and then I heard the

          13   helicopter.  I guess it was a police

          14   helicopter.  You don't hear helicopters over

          15   the building too often.  It was up there and

          16   it was up there and it was up there.  I don't

          17   know if there was two, one, three.  I don't

          18   remember.

          19          Then my students started getting texts

          20   saying there is a shooter in the building.  I

          21   was in the room looking towards that door

          22   because all I could see was that hand coming

          23   through because the shooter must have known

          24   that there wasn't any glass in that door.  I

                                                           15



           1   just felt that way.

           2          I didn't know what to move.  I knew I

           3   had to barricade something.  The file

           4   cabinets were all full.  So I had my students

           5   move that locker to block the door because it

           6   was the only piece in the room that would

           7   have been movable and cover up to the top of

           8   where the opening was in the glass or where

           9   the glass would have been.

          10          I just felt that that would be a

          11   deterrent for the shooter.  Maybe if the

          12   shooter saw a wall, they would bypass the

          13   room.  Then I got a couple texts from friends

          14   that said be careful, there is a shooter in

          15   the building.

          16               MS. GRANT:  Note my objection

          17   regarding the hearsay statements to texts

          18   coming through.  They're all hearsay.

          19               MR. HUTTEMANN:  I'm going to note

          20   they're present sense impressions in

          21   response.

          22               Go ahead.

          23               THE WITNESS:  That's what was

          24   done.  The students sat and we just didn't

           1   know anything.

           2   BY MR. HUTTEMANN:

           3   Q.     Did you hear any gunshots?

           4   A.     I did not hear any gunshots, just

           5   continued to hear the helicopter above the

           6   building, which reinforced what they were

           7   telling and what I was getting on my phone.

           8   Q.     What was said over the PA?

           9   A.     Nothing, not a word.

          10   Q.     Did you hear any other people in the

          11   hallways?

          12   A.     No, did not hear anybody.

          13   Q.     Did anything come up on the PA

          14   indicating that this was any sort of a drill?

          15   A.     No.

          16   Q.     Anything to the contrary?

          17   A.     No, not at that point, no.

          18   Q.     When you say not at that point, was

          19   something said later?

          20   A.     Somebody had said that their parents

          21   had listened to police radio, and that's what

          22   was going on.

          23               MS. GRANT:  Objection, hearsay.

                                                           17



           1   Q.     I'm talking about the PA system in the

           2   building.

           3   A.     No, nothing came over once we heard

           4   lock down.  I don't remember if it was lock

           5   down.  I still can't remember if it was

           6   shelter in place or if it was lock down.

           7   Q.     What does lock down mean -- let's just

           8   take a step back.

           9          Had you ever had any instruction in

          10   the school about what to do in the event of

          11   an active shooter or a lockdown?

          12   A.     We just have a calendar printout.  I

          13   don't remember us ever having a practice

          14   drill.  I don't remember that.  I don't

          15   remember that.

          16          All I knew from our printout was to go

          17   as far away from the door as possible, try

          18   not to be seen, turn off the lights, pull

          19   down shades, be as quite as possible.  My

          20   problem in that room was that not every

          21   window had shades.

          22   Q.     How long were you against the wall

          23   with the students?

          24   A.     It seemed like forever.  It just

                                                           18



           1   seemed like forever.  Maybe an hour-and-ten

           2   minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes.

           3   Q.     During that hour-and-ten minutes, did

           4   you receive any information about what was

           5   going on?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Did someone eventually enter your

           8   room?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Was that at the conclusion of that

          11   hour-and-ten-minutes?

          12   A.     About, yes.

          13   Q.     Who came into your room?

          14   A.     Two police officers.

          15   Q.     How did they enter the room?

          16   A.     They entered the room noisily.  They

          17   banged the door.  They pushed the locker.  It

          18   was just a very upsetting -- I thought

          19   somebody was coming through.  I didn't know

          20   it was them coming through.  Nobody announced

          21   anything.  They just came through, pushed the

          22   locker, and then that police officer said is

          23   this the best you can do.

          24          I just looked at him.  I just said,

                                                           19



           1   well, it's the only thing we had that would

           2   cover that door.  Then the other police

           3   officer looked like his superior.  He said --

           4               MS. GRANT:  Note my objection,

           5   hearsay.

           6               THE WITNESS:  He said you would

           7   have died in here anyway.

           8               MR. HUTTEMANN:  Note present

           9   sense impression.

          10   BY MR. HUTTEMANN:

          11   Q.     Did they enter the room without you

          12   letting them in?

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     How did they do that, do you know?

          15   A.     They just banged through the door.  I

          16   didn't have a door lock because I couldn't

          17   really lock it.  There was no reason to lock

          18   it.  They just banged through the door, or

          19   maybe I did lock it.  No, I didn't lock it.

          20   They just banged through the door.

          21          It was lots of noise because the

          22   locker went all over.  If they had said

          23   police, I would have felt better.  They just

          24   came through, so I just thought I was going

                                                           20



           1   die.

           2          I just thought that was the person

           3   coming through; they figured out the locker

           4   was there and knew I was trying to hide and

           5   trying to hide my students.  That was my main

           6   concern, trying to take care of them, keeping

           7   them quiet and settled.  There was so many in

           8   there at the time.

           9   Q.     Was there an announcement at any point

          10   indicating that the situation was over?

          11   A.     I don't remember that.  I remember it

          12   being over when the police came through.

          13   Q.     Was school dismissed at that point, or

          14   did the day continue to its conclusion?

          15   A.     The day continued.

          16   Q.     Were you able to teach the rest of the

          17   day?

          18   A.     Not really.  I did what I could do.

          19   Whatever lessons I had, we tried to go

          20   forward.  The schedule was off at that point

          21   because the new period would have started.

          22   The schedule was off.  We did what we could

          23   do for the rest of the day with the students

          24   who were there.

                                                           21



           1   Q.     Did you continue to work after that

           2   date on your regular schedule?

           3   A.     I did.

           4   Q.     Was there a point in time that you

           5   noticed that you were having any residual

           6   issues following this incident on January

           7   2nd?

           8   A.     It hit me a few hours later.

           9   Basically, early evening after I left the

          10   school I started to think back, and it was

          11   just disarming.  I thought I was -- I didn't

          12   know what I had just gone through.  I was

          13   really kind of -- I was still in shock, I

          14   think.

          15          Then I just kept trying to go through

          16   the day because that's what I'm used to.  The

          17   kids need you, and you just keep working.

          18   That's what we do as teachers.  We just keep

          19   working.

          20   Q.     Was there a point in time where you

          21   felt you needed medical care to deal with

          22   issues associated with January 2nd?

          23   A.     I did.

          24   Q.     Who did you see?

                                                           22



           1   A.     I did see my family doctor and then I

           2   went to go see Dr. Seidman, a psychologist.

           3   Q.     Who's the family doctor you went to

           4   see?

           5   A.     Dr. Neal Mermelstein.

           6   Q.     Did you discuss with him what was

           7   going on?

           8   A.     I think I did.  I don't remember if I

           9   saw him fist or Dr. Seidman first.

          10   Q.     What were your symptoms that led you

          11   to feel like you needed treatment from a

          12   psychologist?

          13   A.     I couldn't sleep.  That was the first

          14   thing.  I had nightmares.

          15   Q.     What were the nightmares about?

          16   A.     That hand coming through that door

          17   with a gun and just shooting.

          18   Q.     In addition to nightmares, was there

          19   anything else that was going on?

          20   A.     I would just get flashbacks of

          21   somebody coming to the door.  I remember that

          22   being a problem for me.  Loud banging.  One

          23   night at home it was either backfire of a car

          24   or fireworks, and I just jumped.  A book will

                                                           23



           1   slam on the floor, I'll jump.

           2   Q.     Did you have any issues with safety

           3   concerns in school following January 2nd?

           4   A.     I did.

           5   Q.     What?

           6   A.     Well, we don't have enough security in

           7   the building.  Those doors are not secure.  I

           8   watched a student let a student in one day

           9   through that particular door.

          10   Q.     What door are you talking about?

          11   A.     This door outside of 150.  It's in the

          12   photograph here.

          13   Q.     On C-Visconi-2?

          14   A.     Yes.  There is another bank of doors

          15   right outside of that door on the side wall.

          16   There is another door to the outside about

          17   100 feet down the hallway.  They're going

          18   past these double doors.  It's a red door.

          19          If you continue straight and then turn

          20   left, there are two more doors within another

          21   75 feet to the outside going through those

          22   double doors.  To the right, is a bank of

          23   about eight doors to the outside.  There are

          24   just doors all over.

           1   Q.     Did you ever observe any students

           2   coming in and out of those doors?

           3   A.     On a few occasions, but usually I'm in

           4   the classroom, so I don't always get to see

           5   that.

           6   Q.     Was there any particular times where

           7   you felt threatened by any situations with

           8   the students?

           9   A.     No, not my students.

          10   Q.     Any students in the school?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     When did this school day end?

          13   A.     The school day ends at 2:45.

          14   Q.     Did the school have after-hour

          15   programs?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Were you there during the after-hour

          18   programs?

          19   A.     I was.

          20   Q.     What were the after-hour programs for?

          21   A.     The after-hour programs are for those

          22   students who did not finish their high school

          23   diplomas in a day-school program.  We have

          24   what we call the EOP program, Educational

                                                           25



           1   Opportunity Program.

           2          The Spanish program was put in place

           3   about two years after I started, and I was

           4   approached by the school to teach that

           5   program.  They said to me, we know you like

           6   our students and our students will like you.

           7   I always felt honored, and I always felt

           8   responsibile to take that program when it was

           9   offered.

          10   Q.     Were you teaching that program as of

          11   January 2nd?

          12   A.     I was.

          13   Q.     How was the security in the

          14   after-school program or the EOP program?

          15   A.     They set up the metal detector in one

          16   place to allow students to come in.  It was

          17   found, however, that there were a couple

          18   students bypassing, coming in through another

          19   door, a back door or such.

          20          I approached one of the students one

          21   day about that, and he just used expletives

          22   and yelled at me, telling me to mind my f'ing

          23   business and just teach the f'ing Spanish and

          24   don't bother him.  I just immediately thought

                                                           26



           1   he had a weapon, a gun.

           2   Q.     You had observed him entering without

           3   going through the metal detector process?

           4   A.     The head of the program had mentioned

           5   something that these two students were

           6   getting in -- two, three, I don't remember --

           7   but I know him in particular was getting in

           8   because he was coming in late.

           9          After a certain time, that metal

          10   detector was shut down, and students were not

          11   permitted to come into class.  How he was

          12   getting in, no one could figure out.

          13   Q.     Was this after January 2nd?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     How many incidents did you have with

          16   this student?

          17   A.     Well, after that particular day and

          18   his yelling at me, I asked he be removed from

          19   the classroom.  I don't remember what

          20   happened to him.

          21   Q.     Did you ever have a fear of students

          22   bringing a gun into your classroom before

          23   January 2nd?

          24   A.     No, I did not.

           1   Q.     Did you complete the school year in

           2   the spring of 2019?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     How did you do over that time?

           5   A.     It was a struggle every day in that

           6   many nights I didn't sleep well with getting

           7   up a few times a night, with nightmares or

           8   flashbacks or just seeing different things on

           9   the television, just waking up and thinking

          10   back on things.

          11          I continued to see Dr. Seidman.  I

          12   looked forward to that once-a-week meeting

          13   because I could talk with him.  I didn't tell

          14   anybody; only, I guess, my son knows.  I

          15   talked to no one at school.  I told none of

          16   my teacher colleagues.  I didn't tell

          17   administration because I didn't want them to

          18   think I was crazy.

          19   Q.     Did you report your issues,

          20   nonetheless, to the administration, at least

          21   from a Workers' Comp standpoint?

          22   A.     We did, yes, I did.

          23   Q.     When did you do that?

          24   A.     That was, I believe, February 12th.

                                                           28



           1   Q.     Do you recall what you told them when

           2   you reported it?

           3   A.     I believe I said I just needed -- I

           4   did ask for an FMLA, Family Medical Leave.

           5               MS. GRANT:  Who is them?

           6               THE WITNESS:  The school

           7   district.

           8   BY MR. HUTTEMANN:

           9   Q.     Who did you speak to?

          10   A.     We submitted the papers to the main

          11   office.

          12   Q.     Who gave you the paperwork to submit?

          13   A.     I took it off the computer, I think,

          14   if I remember.

          15   Q.     Who did you submit it to, do you

          16   recall?

          17   A.     We submitted it to the school

          18   district, to the office of -- I can't

          19   remember names now.

          20   Q.     Did you discuss the incident in school

          21   in the notice that you gave?

          22   A.     No, I did not.

          23   Q.     What did you advise them?

          24   A.     I assumed that they received the

                                                           29



           1   paperwork from the school district itself.

           2   Q.     What did you tell them in terms of

           3   what medical condition you were suffering

           4   from?

           5   A.     I just asked for time for myself just

           6   for health reasons.  I just needed some time

           7   off.  I didn't know if it was going to be

           8   consecutive.  They ask different questions.

           9   I wasn't sure because I've never gone through

          10   this before.  I just needed some time to try

          11   to get better.

          12   Q.     When you say you gave notice, did you

          13   indicate that you suffered a work injury or

          14   thought you were suffering from a work

          15   injury?

          16   A.     I'm not sure.  I had so many papers.

          17   I just know I needed the time off.

          18   Q.     On your claim petition, you indicated

          19   on February 12th you gave notice, verbally

          20   reported your injury to the school

          21   administration.

          22   A.     I guess I did, yes.  I know the

          23   secretary gave me papers, too.  Yeah, one of

          24   the secretaries gave me papers.  I forgot

                                                           30



           1   about that.

           2   Q.     Who did you verbally report your

           3   injury to?

           4   A.     Must have been the -- I guess it was

           5   to the principal.  No, I didn't say anything.

           6   I guess it was to the secretary.  That's why

           7   she gave me the papers.

           8   Q.     You completed this paperwork and

           9   submitted it to someone in the school

          10   administration?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Did you hear anything back?

          13          Did anybody contact you from Workers'

          14   Compensation to ask you what had occurred?

          15   A.     I did get different letters, yes.

          16   Q.     Were they from PMA Insurance Company?

          17   A.     Yes, they were.

          18   Q.     Did you speak with anybody at PMA to

          19   discuss what had happened?

          20   A.     No, I didn't.  I don't remember that,

          21   no.  I just received all the documents that

          22   said everything was going forward, my FMLA

          23   was approved, and that will expire by

          24   September 24th.

                                                           31



           1          I really, as I said, didn't discuss it

           2   with anybody because I was just scared and

           3   never felt like this.  I felt they would

           4   think I was crazy, and I wanted to keep

           5   teaching.

           6   Q.     Did you continue to treat through the

           7   summer?

           8   A.     I did, yes.  I take my medication, and

           9   I go to see Dr. Seidman.

          10   Q.     Who prescribes the medication for you?

          11   A.     Dr. Mermelstein.

          12   Q.     What is the medication?

          13   A.     I take Lorazepam, 5 milligrams, and my

          14   citalopram, 10 milligrams.

          15   Q.     Were you able to return to your

          16   teaching job this fall?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Why not?

          19   A.     As the summer went on, I was hoping

          20   the summer would get better because everybody

          21   says you'll get better, you're supposed to

          22   get better.  I thought I would get better.

          23   It just seems with all the downtime and then

          24   all of these shootings that have been going

                                                           32



           1   on, everything just all comes back again.

           2          I don't go to Walmart now.  I used to

           3   go once a week.  I just stay away.  Schools,

           4   I make sure I drive -- I live here in the

           5   city, and I just make sure I take paths where

           6   I don't even see a school.  I just take

           7   different roads.  If I know a school is going

           8   to be down there, I go a different way.

           9          The shooting in north Philly, all I

          10   could think was the hostages.  El Paso,

          11   Indiana, Orlando, they're just all right

          12   there.  These have been happening lately.

          13   It's too much.

          14          The shooting in the cars, I'm afraid

          15   to drive.  My son drove me down today.  The

          16   other day, I just thought I was going to die.

          17   I was going to the cardiologist.  There had

          18   been a shooting around that corner a couple

          19   weeks ago.  I felt I just wanted to duck in

          20   my car because I thought now they can shoot

          21   me anywhere.  It's just gotten progressively

          22   worse for me.

          23   Q.     Do you still have nightmares?

          24   A.     I still have the nightmares.  I didn't

                                                           33



           1   sleep well last night either.  I think I

           2   could be walking my dog.  I had a nightmare

           3   about that the other night, walking him.

           4   Somebody jumping out of the bushes.  It's

           5   just very real for me.

           6   Q.     Before January 2nd, had you ever been

           7   involved in any sort of an armed robbery or

           8   school shooting, any situation where there

           9   was a gun involved?

          10   A.     No.

          11   Q.     Had you ever treated for anxiety or

          12   post-traumatic stress disorder in the past?

          13   A.     A little anxiety.  I guess it was a

          14   couple years ago.  I guess it was Christmas

          15   time.  Just anxious to make sure I had

          16   everything in order, trying to juggle school,

          17   make sure I had everything for the kids.  The

          18   doctor gave me a little -- I don't know what

          19   now.  I didn't take it for long, maybe it was

          20   a couple weeks.

          21   Q.     Was that Dr. Mermelstein?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Did you have any therapy associated

          24   with that anxiety?

                                                           34



           1   A.     No, no.  I just needed a little...

           2   Q.     Had you seen Dr. Seidman and treated

           3   with him prior to January of 2019?

           4   A.     I did.

           5   Q.     What was that in regard to?

           6   A.     I treated with him when I was a forced

           7   transfer that year that I spent with those

           8   elementary schools.  I didn't know what

           9   happened.  I was a little anxious.

          10          It was a whole new schedule for me.  I

          11   was an appointed teacher for Northeast High

          12   School, and in late August I'm told I'm not

          13   there anymore.  I had to find schools to go

          14   to because at that point the positions were

          15   filled.  It was a whole new schedule for me.

          16   I had to drive.  It was elementary schools

          17   that were available, and I was anxious.

          18   Q.     How long do you recall seeing

          19   Dr. Seidman back then?

          20   A.     Just a couple months, few months

          21   maybe, couple months.  I don't really

          22   remember.

          23   Q.     Other than Dr. Mermelstein and

          24   Dr. Seidman, have you seen anybody for the

           1   issues from January 2nd?

           2   A.     No, but I did see my cardiologist.

           3   Q.     Has your heart condition changed in

           4   any way since January 2nd?

           5   A.     No, he just said be careful.  I was

           6   fearful it was taking a toll on my nerves.

           7               MR. HUTTEMANN:  I don't have any

           8   further questions, ma'am.  Thank you.

          12   BY MS. GRANT:

          13   Q.     Good afternoon, Ms. Visconi.  My name

          14   is Doreen Grant.  I represent the school

          15   district in your Workers' Compensation claim

          16   matter.

          17          I'm going to ask you a few questions.

          18   If you don't understand my questions, let me

          19   know.  I'll rephrase them for you.  I just

          20   want to make sure you understand what I'm

          21   saying so that you can give me an appropriate

          22   answer, all right?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     On January 2, 2019, was there an

                                                           36



           1   active shooter found at Northeast High

           2   School?

           3   A.     Not to my knowledge.

           4   Q.     On January 2, 2019, you described that

           5   on that particular day there was a hand that

           6   went through the glass pane of your door with

           7   a gun.

           8          Did that actually happen, or was that

           9   your fear?

          10   A.     That's what I pictured happening.

          11   Q.     In reality, no one stuck their hand

          12   through the window or the glass pane of the

          13   door with a gun; is that correct?

          14   A.     That's correct.

          15   Q.     You described in the picture of

          16   C-Visconi-2 a red door?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Does that door lead to outside or just

          19   to a different section of the school?

          20   A.     No, that leads directly to the

          21   outside.

          22   Q.     You indicated that you visualized

          23   students allowing other folks on the outside

          24   or I'm assuming other students to come and

                                                           37



           1   enter into that door?

           2   A.     I have seen that, yes.

           3   Q.     Did you report those findings to

           4   administration?

           5   A.     Yes.  Also -- well, I don't know if I

           6   did.  On a different door, I did one day, but

           7   not on that door that day.  That was a

           8   different day.  That was a different time.

           9   Q.     Is it safe to say you've never been

          10   involved in a school shooting?

          11   A.     That's correct.

          12   Q.     Did you indicate you were employed

          13   with the school district for 16 years; is

          14   that correct?

          15   A.     I was hired September 4, 2003, so this

          16   was my 16th year.

          17   Q.     When you were initially hired, you

          18   were not a certified teacher; is that

          19   correct?

          20   A.     That's correct.

          21   Q.     But through a program that the school

          22   district has and given their shortage of

          23   teachers, you were hired and taught while you

          24   worked on your certification; is that

                                                           38



           1   correct?

           2   A.     That's correct.

           3   Q.     You were hired on the basis of an

           4   emergency teaching permit?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     When did you ultimately get your

           7   certification?

           8   A.     I guess it was four or five years in I

           9   had my Master's degree and continued to take

          10   the classes and did what I had to do.

          11   Q.     When you applied to the school

          12   district, you were aware that it would be a

          13   disproportionate number of students that were

          14   inner-city youths?

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     That comes along with lower aptitudes?

          17   A.     Yes, at times.

          18   Q.     Those youths also come with, I guess,

          19   dysfunction?

          20   A.     Everyone has their...

          21   Q.     Issues?

          22   A.     Right.

          23   Q.     Unfortunately, because you're dealing

          24   with inner-city youths, you have more issues

                                                           39



           1   with families and things like that --

           2               MR. HUTTEMANN:  I'm just going to

           3   object to the lack of foundation, because if

           4   she's only taught in Northeast high school,

           5   she's really not in a position to --

           6               MS. GRANT:  Well, I'm speaking of

           7   Northeast High School.

           8               MR. HUTTEMANN:  She has no idea

           9   what other student bodies are.  If you're

          10   saying that there's more issues there, I

          11   don't know there is a foundation for that.

          12               THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't say

          13   unfortunately.  I love teaching there, and I

          14   love teaching my students.  They're kids.

          15   They're teenagers.  I say I just want to be a

          16   little part of your life that you can go on

          17   and say I learned something, and that we

          18   would have a fun time together and learning

          19   time together, so I miss them.

          20   BY MS. GRANT:

          21   Q.     The students that you did teach over

          22   the years, did they ever have disciplinary

          23   issues or problems during your class?

          24   A.     They've had their issues, as teenagers

                                                           40



           1   do.  Of course, we as teachers, are just

           2   asked to write corrections do what we have to

           3   do to try to keep them coming back.  But they

           4   would always come to class, so I always had a

           5   full house.

           6   Q.     Are you aware that the school district

           7   has had in the past what we call a list of

           8   schools that were deemed persistently

           9   dangerous and was on such a list?

          10   A.     I knew about the list, but I didn't

          11   know all the schools that were on it.  I

          12   really didn't pay attention to that because I

          13   wouldn't have gone to the school district if

          14   I was afraid of that.

          15   Q.     But you were aware that there was some

          16   Philly schools that were on that persistently

          17   dangerous list?

          18   A.     I heard that.

          19   Q.     Are you aware of whether or not

          20   Northeast High School was on that particular

          21   list?

          22   A.     I really wasn't, no.

          23   Q.     Now, the school district employs

          24   resources, such as school police, school

                                                           41



           1   resource officers, and metal detectors, in

           2   attempt to cure violence in the schools,

           3   correct?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     Would you agree with me that the metal

           6   detectors are used to detect individuals and

           7   students that possess items such as knives

           8   and firearms?

           9   A.     Well, I understood that those metal

          10   detectors were to prevent any harmful items

          11   to come through the door, whatever they may

          12   be, for instance.

          13   Q.     Specifically, with respect to

          14   Northeast High, you indicated that, of the 16

          15   years, you spent 15 years at that school?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     Do they have school police or resource

          18   officers?

          19   A.     At Northeast High School?

          20   Q.     Yes.

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     I believe you indicated this, but the

          23   students at your school also have to go

          24   through metal detectors?

                                                           42



           1   A.     They do upon entry in the morning,

           2   yes.

           3   Q.     When you say entry in the morning, if

           4   a student came through late at noon, would

           5   they still have to enter into a particular

           6   area and go through metal detectors, as well?

           7   A.     To my knowledge, they are asked to

           8   come through the front door where there is a

           9   metal detector in place because, of course,

          10   we have visitors and guests who come through,

          11   as well.  Everyone is put through that.

          12          Teachers have talked, and we find from

          13   records that sometimes students do get in the

          14   building and didn't swipe through with their

          15   ID card.  How they get in, I don't know.

          16   Q.     You, as a teacher, given the fact that

          17   you have metal detectors, you have the school

          18   police and the resource officers, have you

          19   been instructed on what to do if violence

          20   occurs in your high school?

          21   A.     No, not to my knowledge.

          22   Q.     Say a fight broke out.  Are you

          23   instructed whether or not to contact the

          24   guidance office, the resource officers?

                                                           43



           1          What would be your steps?

           2   A.     If a fight breaks out, we're to call

           3   security.

           4   Q.     You have a phone in your room?

           5   A.     Yes, there are phones in the rooms.

           6   Q.     Does the school district including

           7   Northeast High, do they employ the slogan:

           8   If you see something, say something?

           9   A.     I'm not sure about that.

          10   Q.     You haven't heard that slogan at your

          11   school at all?

          12   A.     I've heard the slogan, but I can't say

          13   at school.  That, I don't recall.

          14   Q.     Do you attend school assemblies when

          15   the students receive instructions regarding

          16   school safety and things of that nature?

          17   A.     I attend assemblies, as required.  I

          18   don't remember any safety assemblies.

          19   Q.     Northeast High, do they have school

          20   drills?

          21   A.     What kind of drills?

          22   Q.     I'm asking you.

          23   A.     We have fire drills.

          24   Q.     You recall having fire drills?

                                                           44



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     What do you do in the case of a fire

           3   drill?

           4   A.     In case of a fire drill, we direct the

           5   children, depending on the room you're in --

           6   because we're in different rooms -- depending

           7   on the room, we follow the instructions to

           8   get the students outside as quickly as

           9   possible, turn off all the lights, turn off

          10   air-conditioners, if they're on, close and

          11   lock the doors and take your attendance book

          12   with you.

          13   Q.     Have you ever participated in a

          14   lockdown or shelter in place drill?

          15   A.     Not that I remember.

          16   Q.     Not that you remember?

          17   A.     I don't.  I really don't.

          18   Q.     I believe you offered instructions on

          19   direct on what's supposed to happen on a

          20   shelter in place or lockdown drill?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Can you tell me what's supposed to

          23   happen in your classroom when that drill is

          24   in effect?

                                                           45



           1   A.     We're to lock the door, turn off the

           2   lights -- maybe this is not in the right

           3   order -- pull down shades, at least cover

           4   windows, gather students as far away from the

           5   door or visibility as possible.

           6   Q.     Is that what you recall doing on

           7   January 9, 2019?

           8   A.     On January 2nd.

           9   Q.     I'm sorry, January 2, 2019.

          10   A.     I remember I keep looking at that door

          11   without the glass.  I remember just trying to

          12   do the best I could.  I remember getting the

          13   students over to the wall, turning off the

          14   lights, closing the door and just trying to

          15   keep them quiet.  I knew the windows on the

          16   other side, somebody could look in and see

          17   them.  So I just wanted them as quiet as

          18   possible.  Then we moved that locker to the

          19   door.

          20   Q.     You indicated that there was an

          21   announcement on January 2nd over the PA

          22   system?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     Was there also sirens going off or

                                                           46



           1   lights flashing, anything like that that

           2   occurred?

           3   A.     No, I don't think we have that kind of

           4   a system.

           5   Q.     You'd be relying on the PA system,

           6   someone coming over to tell you?

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Do you recall at all what was said

           9   over the PA system?

          10   A.     I couldn't remember if -- I can't

          11   remember if it was lockdown or shelter in

          12   place.

          13   Q.     Is it your testimony that you didn't

          14   know if it was a drill or a real-life

          15   occurrence?

          16   A.     That's correct.  The only other signal

          17   was that helicopter in the sky that stayed in

          18   that place.  It wasn't like an airplane

          19   flying over.  It just stayed in that place.

          20   It was very eerie.

          21   Q.     The Philadelphia Police showed up?

          22   A.     Yes, whoever's helicopter is up there.

          23   Q.     You indicated that there were two

          24   police officers that came to your room?

                                                           47



           1   A.     In the finale, when I thought it was

           2   over, yes.

           3   Q.     Did you have a discussion with the

           4   police officers indicating that the drill or

           5   the lockdown procedure was essentially over

           6   and the building was cleared?

           7   A.     Well, they didn't really say much.

           8   They busted in, as I said, which was

           9   shattering; best you could do, you could die

          10   in here.

          11          There was no other conversation, and

          12   they just cleared.  There are over 200 rooms

          13   in the building, and I understand they were

          14   going room to room.

          15   Q.     Why do you believe they indicated that

          16   you were going to die in there?

          17   A.     Because of the metal gradings that are

          18   permanently attached to the window.

          19   Q.     Meaning you couldn't get out of the

          20   window?

          21   A.     Correct.

          22   Q.     You had one way in and one way out of

          23   the room, and that would have been through

          24   that door?

                                                           48



           1   A.     That's correct.

           2   Q.     After the police officers left your

           3   room, you began to go back to normal

           4   procedures, getting the students together so

           5   that they could go on to their next

           6   classroom?

           7   A.     That's correct, as I remember.

           8   Q.     You don't recall or do you recall

           9   whether or not a person came on the PA system

          10   that indicated that this is what we're going

          11   to do next, particularly since you were off

          12   schedule?

          13   A.     I don't remember that at all.  I don't

          14   remember.  We must have been given some kind

          15   of directive to know where to go next because

          16   of the schedule, but I don't really remember.

          17   Q.     You indicated earlier on direct that

          18   you received text messages from friends

          19   indicating that there was a suspected gunman

          20   in the building.

          21          What friends were those?  Other

          22   teachers that you were working with?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     Were those friends outside of the

                                                           49



           1   school?

           2   A.     There were one or two from the outside

           3   that said be careful.  They said there is a

           4   shooter in your building.

           5   Q.     Those friends would have not had any

           6   personal knowledge of what was going on in

           7   the building?

           8   A.     No.  Apparently, it had hit the news,

           9   and that's where my students were getting

          10   their texts from.  They're very fast, much

          11   faster than me.  I have a flip phone, so I

          12   don't get the news feed the way they were

          13   getting it.

          14   Q.     Whether on January 2nd or thereafter,

          15   was there an official word from your school

          16   as to what occurred or did not occur?

          17   A.     I don't remember that at all.

          18   Q.     That's fine.  Now, during that time in

          19   January of 2019 and shortly before, you

          20   received a suspension without pay and issued

          21   a warning following a complaint from a

          22   student; is that correct?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     You did not?

                                                           50



           1   A.     I did not.  I did not receive a

           2   suspension.  I did receive a warning.  I did

           3   not receive a suspension or loss of pay.  The

           4   union did appeal that because the school

           5   didn't do, in a timely fashion, what they

           6   needed to do, so that's on appeal.

           7          We understand there's no mediator

           8   there at the school district, so it's going

           9   to take some time.  But everything was

          10   rectified.

          11   Q.     What was the allegation against you

          12   that caused the warning?

          13   A.     There were a couple meetings that the

          14   assistant principal set up for me that I did

          15   not attend.

          16   Q.     What were those meetings for and what

          17   did they surround?

          18   A.     The assistant principal was new to our

          19   building.  There were certain procedures that

          20   we, in our department, would follow.  One of

          21   my students needed to have a more advanced

          22   Spanish class.  Within the department, we

          23   usually just take them to a teacher.  We talk

          24   about it first, and then the teacher takes

                                                           51



           1   them on.  We just make the changes from

           2   there.

           3          The parent, in the meantime, had come

           4   in to talk about the student being moved.

           5   She wanted her daughter moved.  We made the

           6   move for a day or so.  The student came back

           7   to me.

           8          When Mr. Greaves called me in to look

           9   at my lesson plans, my syllabus, the

          10   syllabus, as I told him, was online.  We use

          11   the same syllabus for world language.  My

          12   lesson plans, I always keep on my desk.  I

          13   know the school started to ask to have them

          14   e-mailed to them, but I always keep them on

          15   my desk.  That's what I've been doing for so

          16   many years.  I feel, if somebody walks in,

          17   they would be able to see them right there.

          18          In turn, I don't know what the meeting

          19   was.  I didn't go to that meeting.  I did

          20   have a meeting with Mr. Crowder, and then we

          21   did have a meeting.  That seemed to be okay.

          22   The school district came in.

          23          I think Mr. Greaves had some students

          24   write me up.  They had write-ups, and the

                                                           52



           1   representative from the school district said

           2   we see that everyone is saying you're

           3   teaching.  You're teaching.  We just need to

           4   see your lesson plans.

           5          Ms. McGowan, who is my union rep, said

           6   Ms. Visconi has been here so many years.  She

           7   leaves her lessons plans on her desk.  I just

           8   feel it was a miscommunication.  Those things

           9   happen all the time.  Mr. Greaves did

          10   re-evaluate me this year for my lessons and

          11   gave me two lovely evaluations.

          12   Q.     Was there any allegations that you

          13   cursed in class and sexually harassed a

          14   student?

          15   A.     This was an incident, and the way that

          16   was portrayed in the writing wasn't actually

          17   correct.  I told Dr. Seidman.  I share so

          18   much with him.  He's doing the best with what

          19   I told him.

          20          I asked a group of young men to stop

          21   brushing their hair one day in class.  The

          22   one in particular got up and walked past me

          23   and said you're just a B.  Go F yourself.  I

          24   said please leave the room.

                                                           53



           1          That turned into, again, having a few

           2   students write me up; his friends, who agreed

           3   with him.  It ended up that Mr. Greaves had

           4   to get other students to submit paperwork

           5   saying I didn't curse at them.

           6          As I said to Mr. Greaves in our

           7   meeting, again with the school district and

           8   again with my union rep, I've always had a

           9   professional position; hospital industry and

          10   utility at PECO doing public service

          11   announcements, having my own office.

          12          For me to go into a school after 31

          13   years of teaching -- first half of my life I

          14   was not in the school district -- I think to

          15   start cursing at students would be very much

          16   out of character.  If anything, as a language

          17   teacher, I teach them to speak with dignity,

          18   speak with grace.

          19   Q.     What about the sexual harassment

          20   allegations?

          21   A.     I don't know what that was about.  I

          22   guess he thought the young man was sexually

          23   harassing me through his language and through

          24   the words he would use in class.  But, no,

                                                           54



           1   no, no.  We just took that Act 126 test, so I

           2   know what that looks like.

           3   Q.     You were involved in the grievance

           4   proceedings on or around the time of this

           5   January 2nd incident?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     Now, as a result of those allegations

           8   of the students and dealing with your

           9   administration, that in and of itself, were

          10   you experiencing an increase in anxiety or

          11   depressive feelings, anything of that nature?

          12   A.     No, because I've been doing this for

          13   years.  Students who fly off the handle --

          14   I've been cursed at before.  I've had

          15   students say to me, why did you let so-and-so

          16   talk to you like that or say that.  I always

          17   go back to everybody has issues.  Everybody

          18   has their problems.  You don't know what they

          19   come to class that day.

          20          I have to be the stable one.  I have

          21   to be the one to take that brunt because they

          22   have nowhere else to vent.

          23   Q.     What about having to go through that

          24   process with the administration, does that

                                                           55



           1   cause you any angst or anxiety, depressive

           2   feelings?

           3   A.     It wasn't the most fun, but I know who

           4   I am.  I know what I present in the classroom

           5   because I'm very professional.  I knew that

           6   things would be resolved.  It might have

           7   taken time and been frustrating on the way,

           8   but I know the truth always shows through.

           9   It just doesn't compare to January 2nd.

          10   Q.     I believe you testified to this, but

          11   from January 2, 2019 you continued to work

          12   through the last day of the school year in

          13   June 2019?

          14   A.     I did, yes.

          15   Q.     That also included that after-school

          16   program that you mentioned that you were

          17   teaching.

          18          Did you do that until the end of the

          19   school year, as well?

          20   A.     I did.

          21   Q.     Now, you indicated that you spoke with

          22   the secretary because you got papers from the

          23   secretary in February 2019; is that correct?

          24   A.     I believe so.  Dates right now, I just

                                                           56



           1   can't remember everything.

           2   Q.     Do you recall where you got the

           3   paperwork?  I'm assuming this is FMLA

           4   paperwork.

           5          What paperwork are we talking about?

           6   A.     I believe it was in the main office

           7   from our secretary, one of our secretaries.

           8   Q.     You got FMLA from the secretary, and

           9   when you completed that paperwork, you would

          10   have sent it down to the administration

          11   building?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     It wouldn't have gone back to

          14   Northeast High School; it went to the

          15   administration building?

          16   A.     That's correct, as I remember.

          17   Q.     Was it Dr. Seidman that completed the

          18   FMLA paperwork for you?

          19   A.     Yes, he did.

          20   Q.     You indicated around about that time

          21   with Dr. Seidman you had difficulty focussing

          22   and concentrating given your high level or

          23   anxiety and lack of sleep?

          24   A.     Yes.

                                                           57



           1   Q.     Do you at all generally work during

           2   the summer?

           3   A.     No, I wasn't granted work, and I

           4   didn't apply this year at all.

           5   Q.     Did you work the summer previously?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     You indicated that your FMLA paperwork

           8   expires as of September 24th?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Do you anticipate returning back to

          11   work?

          12   A.     At this point, I'm going to ask for an

          13   extension on my FMLA.

          14   Q.     You testified that you treated with

          15   Dr. Seidman in the past; is that correct?

          16   A.     That's correct.

          17   Q.     Was that back in 2012?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     What complaints were you feeling in

          20   2012, or what symptoms, I guess, is the

          21   better word?

          22   A.     I was anxious about starting a new job

          23   in a new place with the school district

          24   because I was always there at Northeast High

                                                           58



           1   School.  It came as such a shock.

           2          I guess if I knew months ahead I was

           3   going out, you could make preparation.

           4   Finding out on such short notice and then

           5   looking through the chart and they said I had

           6   to come up with some combination to keep my

           7   job to keep working.  I had to match the

           8   schools, get the approval of the principals.

           9   It was a short window to get that done.  It

          10   was two weeks.

          11          Then readjusting to it.  It was

          12   elementary schools that were the only ones

          13   available.  So I had to change my whole

          14   curriculum.  I taught elementary Spanish

          15   before.  I'm certified K through 12 with

          16   language.  That wasn't the problem.  It was

          17   just getting accustomed to a new program.

          18   Q.     Were you prescribed any medications

          19   around that time for your mental status at

          20   that point in time?

          21   A.     I was, one little thing, but I can't

          22   remember.  It was in the paperwork.  I don't

          23   remember what it was because I didn't take it

          24   for that long.  I guess maybe I took it a

           1   month or two, as needed.

           2   Q.     It was Dr. Mermelstein who prescribed

           3   it?

           4   A.     Yes.  Once I got acclimated to the

           5   schedule, I was okay.  I made new friends.

           6   You just do what you do as a teacher.

           7   Q.     Other than that period around 2012,

           8   were you ever under a psychiatrist or

           9   psychologist's care?

          10   A.     No.

          11   Q.     In the past before January 2, 2019,

          12   were you ever diagnosed with PTSD?

          13   A.     No.

          14   Q.     How about anxiety?

          15   A.     Slight anxiety, I guess, when the

          16   doctor gave me the medication for the school

          17   move.

          18   Q.     In 2012?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Any other time?

          21   A.     No -- yes -- no, no.

          22   Q.     How about depression, ever diagnosed

          23   with depression?

          24   A.     No.

           1   Q.     The only psychologist or psychiatrist

           2   that you've ever treated with has been with

           3   Dr. Seidman?

           4   A.     Yes.

           5   Q.     Have you ever treated with a

           6   counsellor, whether it be in a religious

           7   organization or just someone you know or what

           8   have you?  Have you ever sought treatment in

           9   that type of capacity?

          10   A.     No.  I didn't want to talk to anybody

          11   about this.

          12   Q.     Have you ever been institutionalized

          13   for psychological reasons in the past?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     In 2017, were you involved in an

          16   incident at Home Depot?

          17   A.     I was.

          18   Q.     Was that February 2017?

          19   A.     I guess it was.

          20   Q.     Did you file a claim and are

          21   represented by an attorney for that

          22   particular claim?

          24   Q.     Are you in active litigation for that?

           6   Q.     As a result of that claim, I guess you

           7   alleged that molding struck your face?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     That caused postconcussion syndrome,

          10   vertigo, memory issues and hearing loss?

          11   A.     Yes.  The doctors and the lawyers knew

          12   my only concern -- and the Home Depot

          13   representative -- knew my main concern was

          14   that my health was taken care of, that my

          15   medical bills were taken care of.  I wanted

          16   to make sure I didn't have any mental

          17   problems, any kind of embolism, loss of

          18   hearing, because that wood came down and hit

          19   me and I got scared.

          20   Q.     What symptoms did you experience as a

          21   result of that incident?

          22   A.     I lost a little bit of -- I thought I

          23   was forgetting my words a little bit.  My

          24   hearing a little bit on the one side was off

           1   a little.  Little headaches.  Because when it

           2   first hit, I got pounded.  That was it.

           3          I know from a friend of mine, who was

           4   hit in the head, sometimes it's recurring.

           5   Getting older, I didn't want to have any

           6   future problems.  I asked to see the doctor,

           7   and he said get a lawyer so that the medical

           8   part can be taken care of.  Everything was

           9   taken care of.

          10   Q.     Did you allege any sleep dysfunction

          11   as a result of that incident?

          13   remember.

          14   Q.     Are you actively treating for those

          15   conditions at all?

          17   Q.     Did you lose time from work as a

          18   result of that incident?

          19   A.     I did not.

          20   Q.     Since the January 2, 2019 incident,

          21   has anything else affected your life to cause

          22   you anxiety or depressive symptoms?

          23   A.     No.  I just keep going back to that

          24   day.  It was just the worst day of my life.

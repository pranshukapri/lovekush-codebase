          23   A.     Oh.  I'm sorry.

           6   Q.     What time did the crash happen?

           7   A.     It was -- it was -- I was picking him up after

           8   work.  I don't know the exact time.  I would say around

           9   5:30-ish, but I don't know exactly.

          10   Q.     And where was Colin -- your -- I should be more

          11   formal.  Where was your son seated in the vehicle?

          12   A.     He was in the passenger seat.

          13   Q.     Front passenger seat?

          14   A.     Front passenger seat.

          15   Q.     And based on some of the information that your

          16   attorney has already provided with me, it's my

          17   understanding that you were very familiar with this area;

          18   is that correct?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     That you had traveled it most -- nearly daily; is

          21   that accurate?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Tell us what happened.

          24   A.     We were stopped at the light, and the light

          25   changed.  And we're starting to move forward, and I looked
                                                                      7



           1   at my son.  He said something.  I looked back and hit the

           2   brake but hit her.

           3   Q.     With respect to being stopped at the light, there's

           4   a traffic light controlling an intersection of 202, which

           5   is the road you were on; is that accurate?

           6   A.     202 was the cross traffic.

           7   Q.     The cross traffic?

           8   A.     Yes.  I was on County Line Road.

           9   Q.     County Line Road.  What were the traffic conditions

          10   like on that road, at that light, at or near the time of

          11   the crash?

          12   A.     I mean I don't -- don't recall any bad conditions.

          13   I don't think it was raining.

          14   Q.     The traffic conditions?

          15   A.     Oh, traffic.  I mean it was heavy traffic for that

          16   time.

          17   Q.     With respect to the -- with respect to this

          18   intersection, if you had not been involved in the crash,

          19   you would have made a left-hand turn; is that accurate?

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     You would have made a right-hand turn?

          22   A.     No.  I would have gone straight.

          23   Q.     Gone straight.  How many lanes of travel are there

          24   for your direction at that --

          25   A.     For going straight?
                                                                      8



           1   Q.      -- at that intersection?  All the -- all the

           2   lanes.

           3   A.     It's three or four.  I know that there's a left

           4   turn lane.  I'm not positive if there's a right turn lane.

           5   Definitely three, at least.

           6   Q.     And which of the three lanes that you can recall

           7   were you in?

           8   A.     I was in the second -- the left straight lane.  I

           9   was not in the turn lane.

          10   Q.     How long had you been stopped at that intersection

          11   before the light turned green and you observed vehicles

          12   beginning to travel forward?

          13   A.     I don't know exactly.

          14   Q.     With respect to traffic generally -- traffic

          15   specifically, can you remember how many cars back you were

          16   from the light when the light turned green?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     Do you remember as to whether or not you had to

          19   wait through the cycle of another traffic light before

          20   getting to where you were when the light turned green

          21   before this crash?

          22   A.     I'm sorry.  Say that again.

          23   Q.     Were you in a line of traffic?

          24   A.     I was in a line of traffic.

          25   Q.     How far back were you from the light?
                                                                      9



           1   A.     I don't recall.

           2   Q.     Was it more than three cars back from the light?

           3   A.     I don't know.

           4   Q.     Now, you indicated that the light turned green and

           5   cars began to go; is that correct?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     And you began to travel forward; is that accurate?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     You indicated that your said -- son said something

          10   to you; is that accurate?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Do you remember what the conversation was?

          13   A.     No.

          14   Q.     Do you remember what your son's emotional state was

          15   when he was asking you something?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     Do you know how fast you were going when your son

          18   turned your -- called your attention and you began to

          19   speak to him?

          20   A.     No.  We had just started to move.  It was slow.

          21   Q.     Any way of quantifying what "slow" means?

          22   A.     I mean it was -- we were just like rolling forward.

          23   When, you know, you initially start, you -- I mean it was

          24   slow.

          25   Q.     Your Kia Sorento, was it equipped with an automatic
                                                                     10



           1   transmission?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And was your foot on the gas, the accelerator,

           4   when -- when you began to move forward, or did it -- or

           5   did it just roll after taking your foot off the brake, or

           6   something else?

           7   A.     Specifically, I can't remember.  I mean, you know,

           8   at some point, I -- I don't know.

           9   Q.     Do -- can you estimate how far away the front of

          10   your vehicle was from the rear of my client's vehicle when

          11   you were first stopped at the -- at the -- at the traffic

          12   light?

          13   A.     I don't remember.

          14   Q.     Can you estimate how far you were away from the

          15   back of my client's vehicle when you looked up and saw

          16   that my client's vehicle had stopped?

          17   A.     I mean I know that I was close, because I, you

          18   know, jammed on my brake, but I don't know space-wise.

          19   Q.     Space-wise, was it more than a car length?

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     Was it less than a car length?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Was it less than ten feet?

          24   A.     Yes.

          25   Q.     You just testified that you slammed on the brakes;
                                                                     11



           1   is that accurate?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     Where was your foot that -- and I'm assuming that

           7   brakes?

           8   A.     I mean I -- I don't remember specifically.  I

          10   the brake.

          11   Q.     And you have no memory as to what you were -- what

          12   your foot was doing --

          13   A.     I mean I don't know if my foot -- no.  I don't know

          14   if my foot was like hovering over the gas.  I don't know

          15   if I was on the gas.  I -- you know, it was -- you know,

          23   A.     I believe it was still green.

          12   A.     I mean I saw the car in front of me.

          13   Q.     Did you get a look at what happened to the back of

          16   A.     I mean I -- yeah, I saw what the back of the car

           2   Q.     And what is that?

           3   A.     It's the back of her car.

           4   Q.     Is that an accurate depiction of what her car

          17   are from -- can you tell me how far these overhead traffic

          18   signs are from the actual intersection?

          19   A.     No, I cannot.

          20   Q.     Is that at the corner?  Does -- does that sign

          21   and -- and -- and this -- this pole, is that situated at

          22   the corner of the intersection or back from the corner of

          23   the intersection?

          24   A.     I would be guessing.  I don't know --

          25   Q.     All right.
                                                                     14

           2   Q.     Would you agree that the -- that your -- the front

           3   of your car caused this damage?

           4   A.     I hit the back of her car.  I don't know if she had

           6   Q.     Did you observe there being any damage in the back

           7   of the car that was in front of you before this crash?

           8   A.     I did not.  I did not take any notice.

           9   Q.     All right.  Did you take any photographs of the

          10   other vehicle?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     Do you have those photographs?

          13   A.     Not on me.

          14   Q.     Have you produced those photographs to your

          15   attorney?

          16   A.     I gave them either to my attorney or to the

          17   insurance company.  I don't recall which.

          18                  MR. SILLI:  Didn't you get discovery

          19   answers from us?

          20                  MR. BAER:  I got discovery answers.  I did

          21   not get documents, oddly enough.  I mean I got your -- I

          22   got responses to request production documents.  I'll be --

          23   I'll be blunt and say that the way it reads on our -- on

          24   our file, it may have been corrupted.

          25                  MR. SILLI:  Yeah.  We definitely gave them.

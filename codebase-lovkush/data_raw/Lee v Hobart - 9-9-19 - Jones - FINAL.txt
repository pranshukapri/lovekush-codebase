 6             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Good morning.  We're on
 7   the record.  My name is John Azpilicueta, the
 8   videographer, here with our certified court reporter
 9   Kristi Caruthers.  We're both retained by Lexitas.
10             This video deposition is being held in the
11   Superior Court, State of California, County of
12   Santa Barbara.  Today's date is September 9, 2019,
13   and the time is 9:17 a.m.
14             This deposition is being held at 100
15   Wilshire Boulevard, 21st floor, Santa Monica,
16   California 90407, in the matter entitled "Julie Lee,
17   et al., versus Hobart Corporation, et al."  The

11             Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
12   you are about to give in this matter shall be the
13   truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
14   so help you God?
15             THE WITNESS:  I do.
16             DEPOSITION REPORTER:  Please commence.
17   
18                        EXAMINATION
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Good morning, sir.
21         A.  Good morning.
22         Q.  Can you state your name for the record.
23         A.  James William Jones.
24         Q.  All right.  I just mentioned it at the
25   start of our tape here, but my name's Bryan Cross.
0008
 1   I represent ITW Food Equipment Group in a lawsuit
 2   that you've been retained as an expert in.  Okay?
 3         A.  Okay.
 4         Q.  And I'll be probably asking you most, if
 5   not all, of the questions today.
 6             But I understand you were retained as an
 7   expert witness in this case; is that correct?
 8         A.  That is true.
 9         Q.  Okay.  And you're offering opinions and
10   testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs in this case?
11         A.  Yes.
12         Q.  Okay.  We have not had an opportunity to
13   meet before, so I want to review a little bit of
14   your history and background just to make sure I have
15   a firm understanding of your qualifications and
16   experience.  Okay?
17         A.  That would be great.
18         Q.  All right.  So I have a curriculum vitae
19   that I've seen dated July of 2018.
20             Do you know if there's been any
21   significant updates to your curriculum vitae since
22   2018?
23         A.  Yeah, only a few.  I'm sure I sent you a
24   later in our -- in our deposition materials.  It
25   should be August of 2019.
0009
 1         Q.  Okay.
 2         A.  But the only major changes would be
 3   depositions, trial testimony, that sort of thing.
 4         Q.  Okay.  So you've appeared at a couple more
 5   depositions and possibly a trial or two since July
 6   of last year?
 7         A.  That's correct.
 8         Q.  All right.  But you're -- okay.
 9             And it looks like I'm being handed one
10   that was revised in April of 2019.
11             Does that sound closer to being correct?
12         A.  That's probably right, yes.
13         Q.  All right.  You haven't had any additional
14   educational experience since that time, have you,
15   sir?
16         A.  No, sir, I have not.
17         Q.  All right.  Have you taken on any other
18   professional positions or employment other than
19   J. William Jones & Associates?
20         A.  No, sir, I have not.
21         Q.  Okay.  So it looks like you studied
22   engineering and obtained multiple degrees between
23   1966 and 1973?
24         A.  Yes, sir.
25         Q.  Okay.  And after working for a few years
0010
 1   as an engineer in various positions, it looks like
 2   you became primarily involved with engineering
 3   software.
 4             Is that a fair assessment?
 5         A.  Well, not really.  I was a distributor for
 6   the ANSYS computer program, which is in my resumé,
 7   but my primary business was consulting work at that
 8   time.
 9         Q.  Okay.  So as early as 1977 you were acting
10   as a consultant?
11         A.  Actually, I started my first consulting
12   business in 1974.
13         Q.  Okay.  And what was the name of that
14   consulting business?
15         A.  That consulting business was Swanson
16   Engineering Analysis Associates, or something like
17   that.
18         Q.  Okay.  And it looks like I've got on here
19   that you did Swanson Engineering Associates
20   Corporation from 1974 to 1977.
21         A.  That's correct.
22         Q.  All right.  So really my question was:
23   Starting in 1977, it looks like, at least from the
24   curriculum vitae I have, the bulk of your employment
25   and experience was involved with engineering
0011
 1   software, modeling and animations and things like
 2   that.
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the
 4   testimony.
 5             THE WITNESS:  Well, no, that's really not
 6   true.  I had a company, we sold ANSYS, and we did
 7   technical support and I did training.  But the bulk
 8   of my business was the consulting business.  I had
 9   people doing the marketing and the software sales
10   and that sort of thing.
11             ANSYS is a very complicated and useful
12   program, and I tended to become more of a consultant
13   in the use of the program rather than the selling of
14   it.
15             (Telephonic interruption.)
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  Okay.  Was that Silverado Software and
18   Consulting?
19         A.  Correct.
20         Q.  All right.  And ANSYS, is that an
21   engineering software program?
22         A.  Turn off my phone here.
23         Q.  Is ANSYS that you've referred to a couple
24   of times an engineering software program?
25         A.  It is, yes.
0012
 1         Q.  And what types of things does ANSYS allow
 2   you to do?
 3         A.  It's a very general purpose program.  The
 4   name ANSYS stands for analysis system, and we would
 5   do everything with ANSYS from static analysis,
 6   nonlinear dynamics, modal analysis, heat transfer.
 7   Let's see.  Magnetic capability, fluid flow
 8   capability.  Very general program for mechanical
 9   engineers.
10         Q.  All right.  Would you characterize it as
11   like a modeling or simulation software, then, but
12   from an engineering standpoint?
13         A.  Yes, I would say that, yeah.
14         Q.  All right.  And it allows you, I guess, to
15   depict what either components or systems would do
16   under real world conditions if you put in objective
17   data and you make assumptions that comply with the
18   laws of physics; true?
19         A.  Correct.
20         Q.  Would you agree that the reliability of
21   the resulting models and simulations are going to
22   turn on the accuracy of the inputs and the validity
23   of the software assumptions that are used?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
25   incomplete hypothetical.
0013
 1             THE WITNESS:  The validity of the answers
 2   turns out to be a very strong function of the talent
 3   and the knowledge and the background of the user,
 4   actually.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Okay.  But if you put in bad data or you
 7   rely on poor assumptions, isn't it like every other
 8   software program; it's going to be garbage in,
 9   garbage out?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical.
11             THE WITNESS:  Well, I guess it has to be.
12   If you're not putting in the right information you
13   can't possibly get the right information out.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  And that's where the expertise of the user
16   comes into play in selecting the right data and
17   selecting the right assumptions?
18         A.  Correct.
19         Q.  All right.  When you say you did consulting,
20   was that what you were assisting the users of the
21   ANSYS software with, was figuring out what kind of
22   data to use, what sort of assumptions they should be
23   relying upon for their individual projects?
24         A.  That was part of it, yeah.
25         Q.  Okay.  Was there any particular industry
0014
 1   that most used -- or were you most consulted with
 2   the use of ANSYS?
 3         A.  Actually, we had a very wide variety of
 4   users and clients in that business.  We -- I did
 5   work for Motorola and Intel.  They were a big client
 6   of ours, electronic packaging, thermal and thermal
 7   stress analysis for electronic packages that they
 8   were developing.
 9             I did a lot of work for Rocketdyne on
10   rocket engines that we developed during that time
11   period.  I did considerable work for the nuclear
12   business.  I developed -- I did work for the nuclear
13   shipping containers packaging, nuclear spent fuel.
14   I did a lot of work for the refineries.
15             In my company we were essentially
16   consultants, and by the end of the time I sold the
17   company, I had 45 employees, and we did about a
18   hundred projects a year, consulting projects.  That
19   pretty much sums it up.
20         Q.  Did you ever do any consulting work for a
21   manufacturer of commercial bakery ovens?
22         A.  No.
23         Q.  Now, it looks like your -- was Silverado
24   Software company your company, a company you owned?
25         A.  It was.
0015
 1         Q.  All right.  And did you sell that out to
 2   MSC Software Corporation?
 3         A.  I did, 1998.  Yesterday would be my 21st
 4   anniversary, I think.
 5         Q.  Do you maintain any ownership in MSC
 6   Software?
 7         A.  No, sir.  I sold that stock.
 8         Q.  All right.  And it looks like you indicate
 9   you were director of the Expert Solutions Group for
10   about four years.
11             Was that part of the sales group where
12   they kept you on for your expertise and worked with
13   you?
14         A.  No, it wasn't sales at all.  MSC wanted to
15   become a consultant.  I had developed a good
16   consulting business with ANSYS, and they wanted to
17   get into the consulting business because they
18   weren't doing that.  They were only selling
19   software.  So the Expert Solutions Group was set up
20   to do consulting work within their organization.
21         Q.  Okay.  And I didn't think I said sales,
22   but was that a position you held with MSC to
23   basically help train them on the potential uses for
24   the software you had sold them?
25         A.  No.  Actually, my -- my job with Nastran
0016
 1   was to actually do consulting work using the Nastran
 2   computer program.
 3         Q.  Okay.  Working with their customers?
 4         A.  Or anybody that they could find that
 5   needed consulting work.
 6         Q.  Okay.  At around that same time, it looks
 7   like from 2001 you started J. Williams Consulting
 8   and Engineering?
 9         A.  Correct.
10         Q.  And has that been your primary source of
11   employment since the 2002 time frame?
12         A.  No.
13         Q.  Okay.  What has -- what -- has that entity
14   existed since 2002, J. Williams Consulting?
15         A.  J. William Jones Consulting and
16   Engineering?
17         Q.  J. William Jones Consulting.
18         A.  Yeah, I started that around '98, I think.
19   I can't remember exactly.
20         Q.  Okay.
21         A.  The reason I started that is I -- I was
22   approached by a gentleman who wanted to develop
23   jacks for cars, automobile jacks, floor jacks for
24   mechanics all the way to very large jacks, and even
25   for selling to the Big Three in the United States.

 1   And I told him at the time there's no way I'm going
 2   to work on automotive jacks because they fall on
 3   people, cars fall on people, and these lawyers will
 4   sue you.  It's unbelievable.
 5             And so I said, "I can't do that work," and
 6   so he said, "Well, we'll start another company," and
 7   I did.  I did that company just to take on
 8   commercial products.
 9         Q.  All right.  So you started that company
10   primarily to provide consulting to people that were
11   manufacturing things because you didn't want to work
12   directly with them, given the risk of litigation?
13         A.  Correct, primarily.
14         Q.  Okay.  And as a result of consulting with
15   those various companies, did you in fact have the
16   opportunity to provide expert testimony and forensic
17   consulting such as you're doing in this case today?
18         A.  Yeah, in limited cases, yes.
19         Q.  Well, according to your curriculum vitae,
20   didn't you actually start testifying as an expert
21   consultant back in the 1980s?
22         A.  I did.
23         Q.  Okay.  And you've acted as a litigation
24   expert in more than 150 cases to date?
25         A.  Probably at least that many, yeah.
0018
 1         Q.  Okay.  I know I had asked you about the
 2   2002 time frame.
 3             Is acting as a paid litigation expert your
 4   primary source of income today?
 5         A.  It is.
 6         Q.  For how long a period of time has that
 7   been the case?
 8         A.  As you can probably see from my resumé, I
 9   left MSC Nastran in 2002, if I recall exactly, and I
10   was asked to come to Washington to serve as a White
11   House Fellow.
12         Q.  Sure.
13         A.  And I spent a year as a White House Fellow
14   working on critical infrastructure protection.
15         Q.  Was that a paid position?
16         A.  It was a -- well, I wouldn't consider it
17   to be paid very much.  I had a grant from the ASME
18   that paid $50,000, which was to cover travel, living
19   expenses and my salary.
20         Q.  Okay.
21         A.  Most of the people who took those White
22   House fellowships were employed by the National
23   University, and their salary continued.  I just felt
24   it was the right thing to do and I just did it for
25   basically the expenses.
0019
 1         Q.  Okay.  And am I right that your work with
 2   the White House and subsequently with the ITI Group
 3   was focused on homeland security issues and risk
 4   assessments and things like that?
 5         A.  Yes.  I was asked to put together R & D
 6   programs to try to develop ways of preventing or
 7   mitigating terrorist attacks, and during the year at
 8   the White House, I developed this risk-based
 9   methodology called RAMCAP, and after that year was
10   over, I approached the ASME.
11             We had some good people in Risk and we put
12   together a proposal for homeland security, and for
13   the next six years we were funded fairly well by
14   Homeland Security to develop these different sectors
15   for looking at risk and how much the real risks
16   were, how much you could afford to spend to protect
17   various assets.
18         Q.  Okay.  Now, in addition to this $50,000
19   grant to try and cover your travel and living
20   expenses, you did continue working as a forensic
21   consultant and testifying as an expert after 2002
22   all the way through today, did you not?
23         A.  Yeah, but I only took on one or two jobs
24   while I was in Washington.  I wasn't very active in
25   that business.
0020
 1         Q.  Okay.  When you say "one or two jobs," are
 2   you talking about a few cases a year, essentially?
 3         A.  That's right.
 4         Q.  Okay.
 5         A.  And I had some ongoing cases when I left,
 6   and then I had some clients that relied upon me from
 7   time to time, so, yeah.
 8         Q.  Okay.  If we look at your testimony list,
 9   certainly there is consistent deposition and trial
10   testimony from 1999 all the way through today.
11         A.  Sure.
12         Q.  Okay.  I had asked you about your
13   consulting work earlier.
14             Have you ever acted as a forensic
15   consultant or a litigation expert in a case where
16   somebody was claiming carbon monoxide intoxication,
17   other than this case?
18         A.  No.
19         Q.  And similar to the question I asked about
20   your consulting, have you ever acted as a forensic
21   consultant or a litigation expert in a case
22   involving commercial cooking equipment, generally?
23         A.  I have not.
24         Q.  Moving beyond commercial bakery ovens,
25   have you ever acted as a consultant or a testifying
0021
 1   expert in a case involving any type of combustion
 2   appliance?
 3         A.  Yes.
 4         Q.  Okay.  How many of those cases do you
 5   think you've been involved with?
 6         A.  Well, those aren't cases; those were
 7   actually consulting projects.  I hope I didn't
 8   misspeak.  I thought you meant worked on combustion
 9   projects.  I haven't had any other litigation that I
10   can recall.
11         Q.  Okay.  So what non-litigation consulting
12   have you done involving combustion appliances?
13         A.  I was -- for a number of years, we did
14   work for a company down in San Diego called Solar
15   Turbines, and they make turbine generator sets for
16   supplying power to offshore platforms and other
17   applications.  And they use a turbine, which is a
18   combustion chamber, basically.  It burns natural
19   gas, turns the turbine wheel and generates
20   electricity.
21         Q.  Sure.  So, essentially, these are
22   turbine-generated power systems used on like oil
23   rigs and things out in the ocean?
24         A.  These are standalone power generation
25   platforms.
0022
 1         Q.  Okay.
 2         A.  They build a barge, basically, and there's
 3   a big turbine fuel, and then they have a generator
 4   and some other different equipment on there.  And
 5   they'll float these out to wherever they need power,
 6   tie it up against an offshore platform or wherever,
 7   and they can generate a tremendous amount of power
 8   using that.
 9         Q.  Okay.  And so they have -- if you have
10   natural gas or diesel -- not diesel -- if you have
11   natural gas or another power source, you essentially
12   blow air through the turbine, it spins the blades,
13   and then that blade is connected up to a generator
14   that creates electricity?
15         A.  Well, you take in air and then you
16   introduce the gas --
17         Q.  Sure.
18         A.  -- and you burn the gas in the turbine.
19   And then that gas, which is then accelerated through
20   the turbine, turns a turbine wheel, which in turn
21   turns the generator.
22         Q.  All right.  And what sort of -- what sort
23   of temperature ranges were involved in the
24   combustion process used to power those turbines?
25         A.  My company primarily was involved in the
0023
 1   internals for the combustion chamber.  It turns out
 2   that there's a very -- you're burning gas at a high
 3   temperature, sometimes up to the thousands, so 2,000
 4   degrees or higher, and you have to supply enough air
 5   coming into the turbine to cool the components so
 6   that they don't get above their creep range.
 7         Q.  Okay.  You say the internals for the
 8   combustion.
 9             Was your company involved, then, with the
10   ventilation aspects of the turbine to make sure that
11   you were getting enough draft and air in there to
12   keep it cooled down and avoid fatiguing the metals?
13         A.  No, our job was primarily involved with
14   designing the actual screens.  They have perforated
15   screens inside the turbines that the air -- incoming
16   air flows through the multitude of holes in it so
17   that the combustion process doesn't overheat the
18   metal inside of the turbine.  It's a very -- it's a
19   very tricky design because you're burning gas --
20         Q.  Right.
21         A.  -- and if you've got the metal to
22   temperature of the gas temperature, you would end
23   up -- it would creep and, you know, it wouldn't
24   work.  So you're trying to get as much temperature
25   in the turbine as possible without overheating the
0024
 1   metal components.
 2         Q.  Well, and I get that, but so when you say
 3   you guys were focused on the perforated screens,
 4   were you handling the combustion analysis and the
 5   ventilation analysis, or were you provided
 6   specifications and you had to make sure that the
 7   perforated screens you were providing met those
 8   specifications?
 9         A.  Our job was to take the inlet conditions,
10   model up these metal components, and then run it
11   through a series of thermal transients or other
12   loading conditions which they would supply, and then
13   to calculate the temperature distribution and the
14   stresses in the components.
15         Q.  Okay.  And were the components that you
16   were focused on determining the thermal stress these
17   perforated screens, or all aspects of the turbine?
18         A.  All aspects.  We had -- because the
19   numbers that we came out with of the temperatures
20   had to be used in the rest of the analysis, turbine
21   blades and all the other pieces.  So, you know, it's
22   not a -- you can't isolate just one piece.  The
23   whole thing operates as a unit.
24         Q.  Now, in my limited experience with
25   turbines, am I correct that there were no welded
0025
 1   components within the turbine itself?
 2         A.  I can't answer that as I sit here today.
 3   It's just been too long since I did the work.
 4         Q.  All right.  As we sit here, do you
 5   remember analyzing the effects of the thermal
 6   transients and the temperature distribution and
 7   stresses across welds as well as across individual
 8   components of the turbine?
 9         A.  Well, in -- to the best of my
10   recollection, in designing those components, they
11   used similar materials, similar materials which
12   would have the same coefficient of thermal expansion
13   in the welding material, or any kind of welding rod
14   or deposited metal would also have the same thermal
15   coefficient of expansion.
16         Q.  You just told me a second ago you didn't
17   remember if there was welding.
18             Do you now remember if there is welding or
19   not welding in those turbine components?
20         A.  Well, what I'm referring to is, for
21   example, the turbine blades, how they're attached to
22   the turbine wheel and that sort of thing.  Anytime
23   you have welding inside of a temperature -- of a
24   device that has temperature excursions that large,
25   you always use compatible materials.
0026
 1         Q.  I understand that.  I'm trying to ask what
 2   you were analyzing on this turbine project that you
 3   told me about and whether or not that involved
 4   welding materials or not.
 5         A.  What I'm trying to explain to you is that
 6   once you weld it with the right weld material and
 7   you have compatible materials, you can assume
 8   essentially that it's homogeneous.
 9         Q.  I get that, and that's a generic
10   statement; right?  If you have compatible materials
11   and you use the right weld, then you can presume
12   they're going to move homogeneously.
13         A.  Correct.
14         Q.  The question is:  For this analysis of the
15   combustion appliance you told me about, were there
16   any welds, regardless of the materials and filler
17   used?
18         A.  At this -- today I can't recall.
19         Q.  Okay.  Other than the turbine project that
20   we've been discussing, do you remember any other
21   consulting work that you did that involved
22   combustion appliances or combustion products?
23         A.  Well, the only other thing I can remember
24   would be the engines that we worked on for
25   Rocketdyne.  Of course, that involves combustion
0027
 1   products.
 2         Q.  Okay.  So internal combustion engines or
 3   rocket engines?
 4         A.  Well, these were actually rocket engines.
 5         Q.  Rocket engines?
 6         A.  Exactly.
 7         Q.  There weren't any welded parts in the
 8   rocket engines, were there?
 9         A.  You know, I don't recall, to be honest
10   with you.  I don't think so.
11         Q.  All right.  Let's move on from your
12   experience, then, and I'd like to talk with you a
13   little bit about your publications.
14             You've done -- at least from your
15   curriculum vitae, you've published a number of
16   professional articles and chapters and whatnot as
17   well as, I guess, a couple of historical fiction
18   books, contemporary fiction books?
19         A.  Right.
20         Q.  How did you get interested in Vikings?
21         A.  Well, I've always sort of read about them,
22   and when I was in Washington, D.C. I was living in a
23   one-room apartment, and I didn't have a lot to do at
24   night and on the weekends, so I decided I would
25   write a book.  And so I sat down and started writing
0028
 1   a book.  It took me three years to write my first
 2   book and I rewrote it a number of times, but it was
 3   fun and I enjoyed it.
 4         Q.  Okay.  So is it a good read?
 5         A.  I hope so.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Is it still available out there?
 7         A.  Yeah, it's on Amazon.  I invite you to buy
 8   a copy.
 9         Q.  All right.  Now, among your professional
10   publications, it looks like there's about 44 or 45
11   publications going back more than 40 years.
12         A.  Okay.
13         Q.  Does that sound about right?
14         A.  Yes.  It's been a long career so far.
15         Q.  Have you ever written about carbon
16   monoxide intoxication?
17         A.  No.
18         Q.  Have you ever written about any aspects of
19   commercial cooking equipment?
20         A.  No, I have not written about that, no.
21         Q.  Okay.  Have you ever written about aspects
22   of any combustion appliances?
23         A.  You know, I don't recall any, but I'd have
24   to look at these publications and remember, see if I
25   could remember anything, but...
0029
 1         Q.  So I'm going to hand you what was provided
 2   to us, and this is the April 2019 version of your
 3   curriculum vitae.  I will give you the whole thing,
 4   but I'll at least go to Page 10 so you can see where
 5   the publications begin.  If you can take a look at
 6   those publications and let me know if any of them
 7   address combustion appliances.
 8         A.  Let's see.  Yeah, let's see.
 9             (Document reviewed by witness.)
10             THE WITNESS:  The only thing that I can
11   recall that would be close would be 25, "A Novel
12   Approach for Naval Composite Structures During a
13   Fire."  That's some work I did with these people
14   that were coauthors, and we were looking at fires
15   aboard ships and how we might contain those.  You
16   could call that combustion analysis.  It is in the
17   same sense that we're talking about here.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  Right.  It's not intentional combustion,
20   anyway.
21         A.  I don't think they do it on purpose.  But
22   that had to do with -- ships are divided up into
23   compartments.  Ever since the Titanic, they seem to
24   be more careful about stuff like that, and they
25   don't want to -- if they have a fire in one
0030
 1   compartment, they want to isolate that fire.
 2             So we looked at ways of using different
 3   materials to keep the fire from spreading throughout
 4   the ship.  So it was a combustion -- it was a
 5   thermal analysis, it was an ablation analysis and it
 6   was a thermal stress analysis.  So it had a lot of
 7   different aspects, the best I recollect.
 8         Q.  All right.  So essentially, figuring out
 9   how materials are going to react in the presence of
10   fire and figuring out how to try to keep those fires
11   contained if they break out aboard a ship?
12         A.  Correct.
13         Q.  And is that the only publication you've
14   identified that touches on, I guess, combustion?
15         A.  Yeah, I would have to say so.  There's
16   some peripheral aspects, but they don't really
17   pertain to combustion, no.
18         Q.  All right.  Do you recall what the
19   material or any of the composite materials were that
20   you were analyzing on the -- maybe on ship fire
21   consulting work?
22         A.  I really don't, no.
23         Q.  Okay.  All right, sir.  You have touched
24   on a little bit of your work with the ASME.
25             You were elected a Fellow in 1984?
0031
 1         A.  ASME, yes.
 2         Q.  I'm shifting gears a little bit.
 3         A.  Yeah, I was.  I was elected.  That was the
 4   first year I was eligible, actually.
 5         Q.  Okay.  Have you ever become an honorary or
 6   lifetime member?
 7         A.  I am a life member.
 8         Q.  Okay.  And how do you become a life
 9   member?
10         A.  By living long enough to get that
11   privilege and paying your dues every year.
12         Q.  All right.  So is there a separate fee you
13   have to pay to become a lifetime member and then
14   stop paying annual dues, or is it something that's
15   just conferred upon you after you've been a member
16   long enough?
17         A.  Yeah.  When you've been a member, I think
18   25 years, then you become a life member.
19         Q.  Okay.  They say you've paid enough.  No
20   more.
21         A.  I guess.
22         Q.  All right.  Do you still participate in
23   any of the technical divisions and workshops and
24   things like that?
25         A.  Generally speaking, the only participation
0032
 1   I have is that they almost always invite me, or have
 2   in the past, to their -- they have an annual meeting
 3   where they interface with the Congress, the
 4   representatives, and we have a chance to go hear
 5   what the congressman are up to and what they're
 6   proposing and how they're supporting engineering.
 7   And then there's usually a nice dinner at the
 8   Capitol Building, so it's kind of fun to go there.
 9         Q.  Okay.  And then does that I guess harken
10   back to your service as a White House Fellow with
11   the service and technology that you're one of the
12   guys that gets the privilege of going and seeing
13   what the current administration is looking at?
14         A.  Yeah, that's part of it.  And then also, I
15   was chairman of a fundraising effort by the ASME to
16   fund the ASME White House Fellows program, and I
17   think we raised something like $5 million, and so if
18   you can raise money for someplace, they tend to
19   invite you back.  I don't know why.
20         Q.  So, a subsequent Fellow is then better
21   than the $50,000 grant to try and live in
22   Washington, D.C.?
23         A.  For a year?  Yes.  It's a little more.
24         Q.  Okay.  Good.
25         A.  But the main thing is to have an ongoing
0033
 1   program so that you can afford to put people back
 2   there.  It's really good for the government.  It's
 3   good for the society.
 4         Q.  Was there a particular time where you
 5   participated more broadly in the work of any
 6   particular technical division or divisions within
 7   ASME?
 8         A.  Yeah.  I was chairman of the risk group
 9   there for a while.  We -- the ASME set up this
10   ITI -- I forget what it stands for, whatever it is,
11   Advanced Technology Institute or something,
12   Innovative Technology Institute -- and made me a
13   senior fellow in that because -- excuse me -- they
14   did not have a mechanism for working with outside
15   consultants.
16             The ASME normally uses volunteers to do
17   all of their work, but we set that up as a business
18   unit of the ASME, and I think that continued for six
19   to eight years.  We were being funded by Homeland
20   Security to continue our work there.
21         Q.  Okay.  And so that was through the ITI, I
22   guess.
23             Was it a separate division of ASME?
24         A.  It was a separate company.
25         Q.  Okay.  And that again got back to the risk
0034
 1   assessment, antiterrorism and Homeland Security type
 2   work that you had worked on?
 3         A.  When Homeland Security began funding us to
 4   do the work, the ASME didn't have a mechanism to
 5   work with the government, and so they set that up as
 6   a separate company.
 7         Q.  Okay.
 8         A.  I think it was a nonprofit, 401(c), or
 9   whatever it is.
10         Q.  Okay.  Have you ever been a member of the
11   design engineering technical division of ASME?
12         A.  Well, I've never served on a committee,
13   but when you're in the ASME, you specify a number of
14   areas that you want to receive information, and
15   design was one of them for me.
16         Q.  All right.  So you would get publications
17   from the design engineering division, but you didn't
18   serve on the committee or actively participate in
19   its operations, other than receiving information?
20         A.  I did not -- I wasn't on the committees.
21   I chose not to volunteer my time to the committees.
22         Q.  Okay.  And the design engineering
23   division, it addresses the use of engineering and
24   the design and ultimate realization of products;
25   correct?
0035
 1         A.  Yes, I guess that's a general description.
 2         Q.  They're not my words; they're from the
 3   website, but...
 4         A.  Okay.
 5         Q.  Have you ever been a member or a -- I
 6   guess a committee member or take part in the
 7   activities of the heat transfer division from ASME?
 8         A.  I have not.
 9         Q.  And do you understand that the heat
10   transfer division addresses thermodynamic principles
11   related to heat transfer?
12         A.  I would suspect that would be interesting
13   to them.
14         Q.  Okay.  Other than the ITI we talked about,
15   have you been a committee member or had any other
16   significant involvement with any other technical
17   division of the ASME?
18         A.  Yeah.  For a brief time I was on the
19   piping committee.  That was many back many, many
20   years ago when I worked for Westinghouse, but I
21   resigned that committee when I left Westinghouse
22   because most of those committee spots go to the
23   major companies that support the effort.
24         Q.  People that contribute and then you help
25   write the codes that govern those committees?
0036
 1         A.  Correct.
 2         Q.  All right.  In terms of class work, have
 3   you ever taught the ASME master class on heat
 4   exchange or design that's offered under the Boiler
 5   Pressure and Vessel Code?
 6         A.  I've never taught that class, no.
 7         Q.  Have you ever taken that class?
 8         A.  No, I have not.
 9         Q.  Okay.  Now, over the course of your 20
10   years or so as acting as a litigation consultant,
11   have you ever been excluded by courts for trying to
12   offer opinions that lacked a proper foundation?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Have you ever been excluded as a
16   litigation expert, sir?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
18             THE WITNESS:  In one case, yes.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Was that the Samaya case?
21         A.  (Gestured.)
22         Q.  Was that the Samaya case down in
23   Riverside?
24         A.  I don't know what it -- it was a -- Ford
25   was our -- was the company that we were going up
0037
 1   against, and it was a Ford rollover.
 2         Q.  So is that the Cam Brown case involving
 3   roof crush?
 4         A.  Yeah, roof crush, yes.
 5         Q.  Okay.  And the trial court determined that
 6   you were overreaching and speculating in your
 7   opinions about roof crush and alternative designs?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the
 9   evidence.
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  What's your understanding as to why you
12   were excluded?
13         A.  I was excluded because the Ford lawyers
14   claimed that because I had never worked in a company
15   that designed roofs or had never done roof crush
16   tests that I wasn't qualified to testify.
17         Q.  Okay.  And the court agreed?
18         A.  The court agreed.
19             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the
20   evidence.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Do you recall working on a case --
23         A.  Let me add that that was overturned on
24   appeal.
25         Q.  Okay.  Do you recall working on a case
0038
 1   that involved a drawbar that came loose from a hitch
 2   onto a highway down in Riverside, California about
 3   four years ago?
 4         A.  That, I remember, yes.
 5         Q.  Were you ever advised that the trial court
 6   in that matter excluded your opinions because you
 7   had engaged in what they called rank speculation?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts and
 9   calls for speculation.
10             THE WITNESS:  No, I never was.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  All right.  Did you testify at trial in
13   that case?
14         A.  No.
15         Q.  Were you told why you were not called to
16   testify at trial in that case?
17         A.  It was my understanding that that case
18   didn't go to trial, for whatever reason.
19         Q.  Were you ever advised whether any opinion
20   affecting you at the trial court level was raised to
21   the California Court of Appeals?
22         A.  No, I didn't know that.
23         Q.  All right.  Regardless of exclusion, am I
24   right that as a scientist and a professional, you
25   want to make sure you've got objective evidence and
0039
 1   that you test your opinions to the extent possible?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
 3   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.
 4             THE WITNESS:  Yes, I always try to do
 5   that.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  Okay.  Do you believe you've done that in
 8   this case?
 9         A.  In this case?
10         Q.  Yes.
11         A.  Yes.
12             MR. CROSS:  Okay.  We've been going about
13   an hour and I'm out of coffee, so if you don't mind
14   taking a quick break, I'm ready to move into a new
15   area and talk about some of your file materials.  So
16   why don't we take five minutes and we'll come back.
17             THE WITNESS:  Great.
18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  The
19   time is 10:00 a.m.
20             (Whereupon, a recess was held
21             from 10:00 a.m. to 10:10 a.m.)
22             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the
23   record.  The time is 10:10 a.m.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  Sir, before we move into your file in this
0040
 1   matter, I did want to follow up.
 2             The project you did with the Solar
 3   Turbine, we were talking about the analysis you did
 4   on the various components and making sure they all
 5   worked together, just from a quick Internet search,
 6   it looks like predominantly turbine blades are made
 7   of stainless steel, titanium and nickel alloys.
 8             Do you recall what the turbines on the
 9   Solar Turbine project -- was that the name of the
10   company?
11         A.  Solar Turbine, yes.
12         Q.  -- whether the turbine blades on the Solar
13   Turbine project, which of those materials it was
14   made from?
15         A.  I don't recall, no.
16         Q.  Was it your testimony that all of the
17   various components in that turbine, whether it was
18   the blades, the rod, the combustion box, you know,
19   everything involving that turbine, that they were
20   all made from the same material?
21         A.  No.  I didn't -- I said they were made
22   from compatible materials.
23         Q.  Okay.  And what's your definition of
24   compatible materials?
25         A.  A compatible material is one that has --
0041
 1   that when heated, will, even if there's some amount
 2   of differential expansion, it will be within
 3   acceptable limits, and if you check the overstress,
 4   the fatigue, all the other components of the design,
 5   you can make it work.
 6             In the case of the turbine wheels,
 7   typically, the blades are made out of a different
 8   material because they have to be higher strength and
 9   they have to be creep resistant, and they don't weld
10   them in.
11             They use what's called a fir tree.  It's a
12   machine, an end on the blade that the profile looks
13   sort of like a fir tree, and then a similar -- a
14   female hole is built into the blade -- I mean into
15   the disc to hold them, and you slide them together
16   and press them.  That way you don't have to weld
17   them.
18         Q.  So that you have a lot of stress created
19   by the high-speed spinning of the turbine blades?
20         A.  The combination of high-speed spinning
21   plus -- that gives you centrical forces, plus you're
22   heating it at a high temperature.  You know, the
23   hotter you can get the gas to go through there, the
24   more efficient the turbine.
25         Q.  Right.
0042
 1         A.  And so it's a combination of you want
 2   these things to be spinning as fast as possible and
 3   as hot as possible, but you don't want them to grow
 4   to the point where they touch the outer rim of
 5   the -- because that's when you break a blade.
 6         Q.  Yeah.  Nobody wants that.
 7         A.  All hell breaks loose at that point.
 8         Q.  So you indicated that there are
 9   probably -- more likely than not, there were
10   different types of materials within the Solar
11   Turbine turbine that you worked on, and you were
12   wanting to make sure -- and even though they likely
13   had different thermal coefficients of expansion,
14   that they need to be within reasonable accommodation,
15   or I forget -- what was your --
16         A.  They have to be compatible under the
17   temperature excursion that you expect.
18         Q.  Right.  But you talked about the thermal
19   expansion coefficients themselves being within a
20   reasonable range of one another or something to that
21   effect.
22             Do you recall what you had told me?
23         A.  I don't recall the exact words.
24         Q.  But you understand the concept I'm talking
25   about?
0043
 1         A.  Yeah.  For example, if you use stainless
 2   steels or if you use Inconel, Inconel gives you
 3   higher temperature properties, doesn't have as much
 4   creep at high temperature, but it's so much
 5   nickel -- it has more nickel in it than, say, the
 6   high nickel carbon stainless steels, but they'll
 7   have a similar coefficient expansion.
 8         Q.  What is the magnitude of difference in
 9   thermal expansion coefficient that you would view as
10   reasonable between two materials for them to be used
11   together in a high-temperature environment?
12         A.  Well, it depends on the temperature.  The
13   expansion is a product of the alpha, which is the
14   coefficient of thermal expansion times the
15   temperature difference between cold and hot.
16             So if you got a motor that's sitting there
17   at room temperature and you heat it up to, say, 1500
18   degrees or something, it's going to expand so that
19   if -- for example, if you use a carbon steel, it has
20   a much different coefficient of expansion than
21   stainless steel and so you'll have a differential
22   expansion.  And the bigger the temperature increase,
23   the more strain you will incur at that interface.
24         Q.  So you say it's going to depend on the
25   temperature and other factors.
0044
 1             What are all the factors you want to
 2   consider when determining whether the use of two
 3   materials with different thermal expansion
 4   coefficients is appropriate for a given application?
 5   What are each of the factors?
 6         A.  The --
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,
 8   vague and ambiguous.
 9             THE WITNESS:  I can answer it, though,
10   Rob.
11             MR. JARCHI:  It's just a matter of letting
12   me get my objections on before you answer.
13             THE WITNESS:  I apologize if I --
14             MR. JARCHI:  No problem.  Try to wait.
15             THE WITNESS:  But, yes, first of all, a
16   lot of it will depend on the geometry that you're
17   dealing with.  But primarily, when you're using two
18   different materials with different coefficients of
19   expansion, the trick is to maintain a balance
20   between the amount of temperature increase you have
21   and the difference in the alpha, or coefficient of
22   thermal expansion.
23             So if you just take two materials and weld
24   them together, a linear piece of material like a
25   plate, and you weld it together along the seam, the
0045
 1   stresses are proportionate to E, assuming they have
 2   the same modulus, times the difference in alpha,
 3   alpha 1 minus alpha 2, times the temperature
 4   increased, delta T.  So the stress is E alpha,
 5   difference, delta T.
 6             And so if you can maintain that thermal
 7   stress within limits, then that will tell you how
 8   much temperature rise you can afford for given two
 9   materials that are being welded together.
10         Q.  Are there any -- are there any constraints
11   on the use of that -- that equation in terms of
12   looking at the differential of the thermal expansion
13   properties?  Can you just increase the temperature
14   without limit and still determine the thermal
15   expansion properties of the two separate materials
16   proportionally without limit as to the amount of
17   stress each one is seeing?
18         A.  I'm not sure I understand your question,
19   but could you rephrase it?
20         Q.  Yeah.  You said you're balancing the
21   temperature and the thermal expansion differences
22   looking at the stress.
23             If you exceed the ultimate stress
24   capability for one material or the other, is that
25   going to have an impact on the use of the equation
0046
 1   that you've just referenced?
 2         A.  Sure.
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 4   incomplete hypothetical.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  You said "sure."
 7             How would it?
 8         A.  The equation I gave --
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  Sorry.  Same
10   objections.  Just skip a beat before you answer,
11   please.
12             THE WITNESS:  All right.
13             MR. JARCHI:  You can go.
14             THE WITNESS:  Okay.  All right.  Let's go.
15   The -- to answer your question the best I can, the
16   equation that I give you, the strain is equal to
17   alpha delta T.  That's the strain.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  Right.
20         A.  If you exceed the linear elastic
21   properties of the material, you will still get the
22   same amount of strain, but the stress is no longer
23   proportional to the strain.
24             So basically, you could get yielding in
25   the materials, and typically, when you're doing a
0047
 1   thermal stress analysis, you have different stress
 2   limits that you would use for thermal stress
 3   analysis compared to the -- say, just the loading of
 4   a part.
 5             And according to the ASME code, for
 6   example, thermal stresses are categorized as
 7   secondary stresses so that you can actually have a
 8   range of stress so that even if you yield something
 9   on the first part of the cycle, you'll get a -- when
10   it cools down, you'll get a residual stress so that
11   when you heat it up again, you'll go from being in,
12   say, compression to tension so you can get -- the
13   range of stress can be up to twice yield and still
14   be acceptable.
15         Q.  Okay.  So in layman's terms -- or not
16   layman's, but at least less engineering terms --
17   when you're talking about yield, are you talking
18   about some form of plastic deformation of the
19   material?
20         A.  Sure.  If you -- if you take a bar, a
21   tensile specimen and pull on it, by Hooke's law,
22   you'll get a linear relationship of a displacement
23   versus the load.
24         Q.  And once that plastic deformation or
25   permanent deformation is --
0048
 1         A.  Once you reach the yield point, now
 2   you're -- you will no longer get an increase in
 3   stress that's proportional to the strain.
 4         Q.  Right.
 5         A.  That's yielding.
 6             But with thermal stresses, it's okay
 7   sometimes to yield, because when it cools down,
 8   you'll get a residual stress that will be beneficial
 9   to you, so on the next cycle you'll get a different --
10   you won't be yielding on the second go-around.
11         Q.  And it can even change between tension and
12   compression?
13         A.  Yeah.  And of course one of the complicating
14   factors is that, number one, if you look at the
15   allowable -- if you look at the yields, the yield at
16   high temperature is usually lower, considerably
17   lower than the yield at low temperature.
18             Secondly, if you're up to around 1200,
19   1400 degrees, you're going to get creep, so you
20   think you're going to have a residual stress, but
21   what happens is that residual stress creeps out at
22   the high temperature.
23             So when you start dealing with this
24   thermal stress analysis, it is -- it's not -- it's
25   not a simple -- it's not a simple case.
0049
 1             MR. CROSS:  Okay.  All right, sir.  Let me
 2   hand you what's been marked as Exhibit 1, and this
 3   was the notice for your deposition.
 4             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 1 was
 5             marked for identification by the
 6             deposition reporter and is attached
 7             hereto.)
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Let me just ask you if you have previously
10   reviewed this document.
11         A.  I have.
12         Q.  All right.  And did you understand that as
13   part of the deposition today, you were requested to
14   bring your complete file with you?
15         A.  Actually, it's my understanding that we
16   had to send it to you about three or four working
17   days in advance.
18         Q.  Okay.  Well, then let me follow up with
19   that.
20             Did you provide your entire file for this
21   matter to counsel to be produced last week?
22         A.  I did.
23         Q.  Okay.  To your knowledge, has anything
24   been removed or withheld from your file?
25         A.  Not to my knowledge.
0050
 1         Q.  Okay.  Was anything specifically added to
 2   your file for production that had not previously
 3   been in your file before, you know, last week?
 4         A.  The only thing is the time sheets.  I
 5   produced those, and I just gave a summary and you
 6   requested or something -- I can't remember, but that
 7   was asked of me, to have a breakdown.  So I gave you
 8   that.
 9         Q.  So within your file that you maintained
10   for this case, you have basically a ledger that
11   identifies individual invoices and payment status
12   for each of them?
13         A.  Correct.
14         Q.  But you had originally only sent the
15   ledger as opposed to the underlying invoices?
16         A.  Correct.
17         Q.  And at some point you were asked to
18   produce the individual invoices as well?
19         A.  I did.
20         Q.  Okay.  When were you asked to provide
21   those individual invoices?
22         A.  Last Friday or last Thursday.  I can't
23   remember.  Along in there.
24         Q.  And did you produce those?
25         A.  I did.
0051
 1         Q.  Okay.  From the file that was produced to
 2   us -- or let me ask you first:  Within Exhibit 1,
 3   one of the things we've asked you for, and this
 4   appears under Items 5 and 6, pertain to all sorts of
 5   communications either with the attorneys or other
 6   experts involved in this lawsuit.
 7             Have you produced all of the documented
 8   communications you've engaged in with either
 9   attorneys or experts regarding this case as part of
10   your file?
11         A.  As far as I know, I did.
12         Q.  All right.  Now, I will tell you that the
13   production file I received was limited primarily to
14   E-mail transmittals of material.
15             Does that sound consistent with the
16   documentary communications that you've received --
17   or that you've engaged in in this case?
18         A.  Yes.  We -- I don't have a fax machine,
19   for example.
20         Q.  Okay.  Do you have a computer?
21         A.  Yeah, I have a computer, sure.
22         Q.  Okay.  And so have you received
23   substantive information, I guess, in terms of
24   communications separate and apart from attached
25   materials about this case from Mr. Jarchi or his
0052
 1   office?
 2         A.  There was, I think, a thumb drive that
 3   contained a whole bunch of documents that were
 4   produced.
 5         Q.  Okay.  And I understand that you -- the
 6   transmittal suggests you were provided over the
 7   course of the last couple of years lots and lots of
 8   materials.
 9         A.  You better believe it.
10         Q.  Was there substantive information text
11   provided in any E-mail communications with
12   Mr. Jarchi or his office?
13         A.  No.
14         Q.  Okay.  Have you engaged in telephone
15   conversations with Mr. Jarchi about this case?
16         A.  Considerably.
17         Q.  Okay.  Have you maintained notes on any of
18   the considerable telephone conversations you've had
19   with Mr. Jarchi?
20         A.  No.  When you're talking with Rob, it's
21   hard to take notes, as you may have noticed.
22         Q.  I noticed, but probably for different
23   reasons.
24             (Laughter.)

 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  All right.  I had not seen any documentary
 3   communications, E-mails, things like that, with
 4   other experts.
 5             Have you engaged in any E-mail communication
 6   with any other expert in this case?
 7         A.  No E-mails.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Have your interactions with other
 9   experts been limited to either in-person or
10   telephonic communications?
11         A.  That's correct.
12         Q.  All right.  Do you remember who all you've
13   spoken with?
14         A.  Sure.  I've spoken with Joe Romig.  Met
15   him at one of the inspections, maybe two of them.  I
16   can't remember.  And then we talked on the phone a
17   couple of times.  Joellen Gill, I talked to her and
18   met her in person a time or two.  Galatsis is the
19   other guy.  I don't recall having a direct
20   conversation with him.
21         Q.  That's Dr. Galatsis?
22         A.  Yeah.
23         Q.  Okay.  So did you have conversations about
24   Dr. Galatsis's work or testimony with somebody else?
25         A.  With Rob.
0054
 1         Q.  Okay.  But you didn't have any direct
 2   communications with Dr. Galatsis at any time --
 3         A.  Not that I can recollect.
 4         Q.  Okay.  Any other experts besides Dr. Romig
 5   and Ms. Gill that you recall speaking with about
 6   this case?
 7         A.  No.  The only other guy that I would have
 8   possibly wanted to talk to was Hendrickson, and I
 9   don't recall having a conversation with him, no.
10         Q.  Okay.  So you have not talked with
11   Mr. Hendrickson at any time?
12         A.  I don't believe so.  I can't remember it
13   if I have.
14         Q.  Okay.  Did you know Dr. Romig prior to
15   your work in this case?
16         A.  I did not.
17         Q.  Did you know Mr. Hendrickson prior to your
18   work in this case?
19         A.  I did not.
20         Q.  Okay.  How about Ms. Gill?
21         A.  Never met her before either.  These are
22   all new people to me.
23         Q.  You talked about attending some sort of
24   inspection with Dr. Romig, and you said maybe one or
25   maybe two.  Tell me first about the inspection you
0055
 1   do recall attending with Dr. Romig.
 2             When was that?
 3         A.  Let's see.  It was the spring.  I don't
 4   remember the exact date, but --
 5         Q.  You say the spring.
 6             Was it this spring, 2019?
 7         A.  Yes, 2019.  We went up to a company up in
 8   Irwindale that sells -- looked like they sell
 9   refurbished equipment for baking and commercial
10   foods preparation, and I spent most of the day with
11   him doing some testing on an exemplar oven there.
12         Q.  Okay.  I might come back and ask you a lot
13   more about that, but let me ask you:  Did you have
14   any discussions with Dr. Romig about that inspection
15   and testing and what you were planning to do prior
16   to going there that day?
17         A.  Not that I recollect, no.
18         Q.  All right.  Do you -- did you have any
19   expectation or understanding about what the purpose
20   of that inspection was before you went there that
21   day, from any source?
22         A.  Yeah, I had a general idea of what we
23   wanted to do.
24         Q.  What was your understanding of what the
25   purpose of that testing and inspection was?
0056
 1         A.  Well, the purpose of that test was
 2   actually to see one of these ovens in operation.
 3         Q.  Okay.
 4         A.  And there were a number of different tests
 5   that we ran that day to try to understand the basic
 6   operation of the system and to do some measurements
 7   on the -- on the combustion gas exhaust that were
 8   produced by the -- by running it.
 9         Q.  Okay.  So the general purpose was to see
10   one of the ovens in operation and then also to get
11   some measurements of the combustion gases while it
12   was in operation?
13         A.  Yes, sir.
14         Q.  Okay.
15         A.  That was my major purpose of wanting to
16   see it, yes, sir.
17         Q.  All right.  Did you have any role in
18   determining the types of testing that would be run
19   that day?
20         A.  No.  Joe and his -- the guy that was with
21   him.  I can't remember his name.  It will come to
22   me.  But anyway, they were sort of in charge of the
23   test.  They were designated as more or less the
24   experts in combustion, and I would defer to them for
25   their judgment.
0057
 1         Q.  Okay.  So you understood Dr. Romig and his
 2   associate were the experts in combustion?
 3         A.  Yes, to my understanding.
 4         Q.  Okay.  What did you understand your role
 5   to be in terms of bringing the expertise in this
 6   case?
 7         A.  General heat exchange or design, stress
 8   analysis.
 9         Q.  All right.
10         A.  Guthrie was the other guy's name I was
11   having trouble remembering.
12         Q.  Mr. Guthrie is Dr. Romig's associate?
13         A.  He works with him, yeah.
14         Q.  Okay.  So heat exchanger design and stress
15   analysis you understood as your role in the case.
16             How does that differ, if you know, from
17   Mr. Hendrickson's planned role in this case?
18         A.  Well, it's my understanding that he's a
19   metallurgist, and his primary focus was to look at
20   the metals involved to determine the cause of the
21   metal failure from a metallurgical standpoint.
22         Q.  Are you relying on Mr. Hendrickson's
23   analysis in any way in the work you've done?
24         A.  Peripherally I am, because he made some
25   judgments according to -- to estimate metal
0058
 1   temperatures, ranges, and I was using his -- his
 2   report to try to estimate what would be the metal
 3   temperatures that this would see during operation.
 4         Q.  Okay.  So you were analyzing the stresses
 5   on the metals based in part on the temperature
 6   estimates that Mr. Hendrickson provided?
 7         A.  In part.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Did you have any understanding what
 9   Ms. Gill's expertise was on this case?
10         A.  It's my understanding that she is a --
11   primarily involved in the design process, the
12   hierarchy of design and some human factors, perhaps,
13   that sort of thing.
14             She's not really in my area.  She's a
15   little outside my area as far as being an engineer
16   goes.  I don't think she is an engineer.
17         Q.  I was going to ask you about that when you
18   said the design hierarchy.
19             Do you know what sort of design or
20   engineering experience she has?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation, lacks
22   foundation.
23             THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  I think
24   you've already taken her deposition so you probably
25   know that already.
0059
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  You didn't view her as being within
 3   your area?
 4         A.  Not for stress analysis and fluid flow
 5   analysis, no.
 6         Q.  Okay.  And so now I think you've added a
 7   term for me here.
 8             Initially, you talked about stress
 9   analysis and the critique of the heat exchanger
10   design probably based on that stress analysis.
11         A.  Correct.
12         Q.  You've now indicated something about
13   fluid.
14             What sort of fluid dynamic analysis have
15   you done?
16         A.  I've done some preliminary work to
17   determine the flow rates through various parts of
18   the heat exchanger.
19         Q.  Okay.  And is that the calculations done
20   in the last couple of weeks on the differences in
21   pressure of the combustion gases when you're burning
22   or not burning, and then the -- your analysis of the
23   vent hood efficiency?
24         A.  It's a little more involved than that.
25         Q.  Okay.  What else is involved?
0060
 1         A.  Well, when you're doing a fluid flow
 2   analysis, and I'm considering air to be a fluid.
 3         Q.  Sure.
 4         A.  In the -- in the traditional economic
 5   sense, most people don't think of air being a fluid,
 6   but if you'll bear with me, we'll call it a fluid,
 7   but we can call it air, if you want to.
 8             But when you're looking at fluid flow
 9   problems, the pressure and velocities are intimately
10   related, so you really can't do a pressure analysis
11   without doing a fluid flow analysis, that sort of
12   thing.
13         Q.  Okay.  And I agree with you there.
14             My question, then, I guess is:  Have you
15   looked at fluid flow problems with respect to
16   anything other than the flue gas mixtures in the
17   heat exchanger as reflected on the calculations that
18   have been provided that I think were done on
19   September 1st or the alleged efficiency or
20   inefficiency of the vent hood ventilation aspects of
21   the oven.
22             Has there been any other work addressing
23   fluid problems besides those two pieces of work
24   product?
25         A.  Not that I remember right now.  I don't
0061
 1   think I've done anything else, no.
 2         Q.  All right.  Were you asked to address
 3   those two issues of fluid flow problems or fluid
 4   flow issues following your discussion with Mr. Jarchi
 5   about Dr. Galatsis?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 7             THE WITNESS:  You know, I don't -- I don't
 8   remember.  I'm 99 percent sure that Rob didn't bring
 9   it up.  It was in reading depositions, the transcripts
10   that were -- I think it was Joe Romig's.  I read his
11   deposition, and I thought to myself, "Well, I
12   probably ought to do some calculations just to see
13   what the various pressures would be in the heat
14   exchanger" --
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.
17         A.  -- the kind of flow we're looking at here.
18         Q.  All right.  And we're going to go through
19   those and obviously in more detail, but am I
20   correct -- and you may have answered this:  The work
21   you were doing looking at fluid flow, that's all
22   work that's been done primarily in the last few
23   weeks?
24         A.  Correct.
25         Q.  Okay.  Prior to that time, was all of the
0062
 1   work product you had done in this case focused
 2   entirely on looking at the stresses imposed on the
 3   heat exchanger and your critique of the design of
 4   the heat exchanger based on that analysis?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 6   incomplete hypothetical.
 7             THE WITNESS:  Well, I would have to say
 8   the work I did was a little more general in that it
 9   wasn't limited to that.  And the reason is because
10   the analysis that you're talking about, they involve
11   more of an overall operational thing.
12             The first thing I had to do is try to
13   understand the overall operation of the -- of the
14   heat exchanger, and then -- then I could actually
15   try to get enough information to do these fluid flow
16   and stress analysis.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Okay.  Or at least the stress analysis
19   initially and then the fluid flow after you read
20   Dr. Romig's deposition?
21         A.  Correct.
22         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Now, we've been talking
23   about your understanding of your role and other
24   people's roles prior to going out in the spring of
25   this year and doing some testing and inspection of
0063
 1   an oven in Irwindale.
 2             Have you -- did you have any follow-up
 3   discussions with either Dr. Romig or Ms. Gill after
 4   that inspection and testing?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, calls
 6   for speculation.
 7   BY MR. CROSS:
 8         Q.  Have you talked to Dr. Romig since you saw
 9   him in person at the inspection?
10         A.  I'm trying to think here.  Pardon me.  But
11   I did talk to Dr. Romig after we ran the test up in
12   Irwindale, yes.
13         Q.  All right.  And what did you talk about?
14         A.  Well, the Ponderosa people, Romig and
15   Guthrie, produced some charts.  They were
16   temperature pressure charts, or at least temperature
17   charts.  I'm not -- and they also showed carbon
18   monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and all the
19   combustion -- well, most of the combustion products
20   that were of interest.
21             So I was on the phone with Joe, and asked
22   him to explain to me, you know, what these
23   represented or what the plots represented, and if he
24   found -- if he had any understanding of why they
25   looked like that; in other words, just to give me a
0064
 1   general overall picture of what he learned from
 2   doing these tests.
 3         Q.  Okay.  What did Dr. Romig tell you?
 4         A.  Well, we went through the charts and
 5   looked at the -- at the combustion gas makeup as a
 6   function of time after startup, and he explained to
 7   me what the different colored lines meant, and he
 8   basically explained to me how the analyzer worked,
 9   that sort of thing, gave me an understanding of what
10   was going on as he measured the flue gas.
11         Q.  All right.  And you said that the
12   measurements he did of the flue gas resulted in
13   charts.
14             Was it your understanding that the charts
15   Dr. Romig produced reflected the gases both as a
16   function of temperature and pressure?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates testimony.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  I'm just trying to understand what you
20   just told me.
21         A.  Yeah, I believe it was a time history
22   measurement of the various components in the gas and
23   the -- oh, not the pressure, just --
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  Well, that's what I was trying to find
0065
 1   out.
 2             Was pressure one of the --
 3         A.  I apologize.  No, I didn't -- I wasn't
 4   thinking clearly.
 5             It was the temperature and the components
 6   but no pressure.  He did not measure pressures.
 7         Q.  Okay.  Well, that cuts down on some of my
 8   questions.  Not all of them.  Cuts down on the
 9   length of our breaks, for sure.
10             You mentioned that you, in addition to the
11   stress analysis you performed and the critique of
12   the heat exchanger design, obviously part of doing
13   that was understanding the overall operation of the
14   heat exchanger.
15             What do you mean by understanding the
16   overall operation of the heat exchanger?  What did
17   you do to obtain that information and what did you
18   learn?
19         A.  Well, I attempted to understand how the
20   burner worked, the controls on the burner, how the
21   ignition of the gas worked.
22             I looked at the -- tried to get an
23   estimate of what would happen inside of the heat
24   exchanger as the combustion gases worked their way
25   through the heat exchanger.  I wanted to know how
0066
 1   the secondary system, the heating gas that went into
 2   the bake chamber, I wanted to understand, you know,
 3   the fan, how it circulated the air across the heat
 4   exchanger into the bake chamber.
 5         Q.  The convection fan when the vapor is low?
 6         A.  Convection fan.
 7         Q.  Okay.
 8         A.  And then I wanted to get a feel for how
 9   the exhaust stack worked, the -- the so-called
10   barometric damper, and then just basically the
11   overall operation of the oven.
12         Q.  All right.  And was it your -- was it work
13   you did prior to your initial stress analysis and
14   critique of the heat exchanger in terms of learning
15   all of that, or is that work you did more recently
16   in connection with the combustion pressure calculations
17   that you referenced?
18             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.
19             THE WITNESS:  The -- the -- my work on the
20   heat exchanger and the calculations I made and
21   opinions evolved over time as we learned more.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  Okay.
24         A.  So in my initial visit out to Rest Your
25   Case, the only thing I saw was a burned-out heat
0067
 1   exchanger with gaps between the tubes, and so I came
 2   back to my office and I sat down and had a feel for,
 3   you know, what had happened, and I started trying to
 4   make calculations to see how high the stresses would
 5   be --
 6         Q.  Right.
 7         A.  -- at that intersection between the
 8   stainless steel plate and the carbon steel tubes and
 9   made some rough calculations.
10             And then as I learned more about the
11   operation of the heat exchanger, the cycling of it,
12   due to the bake cycles and then how the convection
13   fan worked, the exhaust, tried to incorporate those
14   into my thinking so I could get more and more
15   in-depth analysis.
16         Q.  And that's what I'm trying to find out.
17             In terms of understanding the burner
18   operation and the ignition controls and the exhaust
19   stack operation, is that information that has been
20   involved in the work you've done during 2019, or was
21   that part of your initial analysis of the heat
22   exchanger stress?
23         A.  Well, my heat exchanger stress analysis
24   hasn't really changed that much.
25         Q.  Okay.  And was that based on your initial
0068
 1   inspection of the heat exchanger plus your
 2   assumptions from Dr. Galatsis's work -- I'm sorry,
 3   Dr. Hendrickson's work?
 4         A.  Correct.  And then I just basically made
 5   some assumptions of my own as to maximum excursion
 6   temperature, that sort of thing, initially.
 7         Q.  Okay.  And then is this additional
 8   understanding or view of materials to have that
 9   understanding something you undertook, say, in the
10   last six, eight months, in order to support a
11   critique of the design as opposed to your analysis
12   of the physics that happened with regard to the
13   actual heat exchanger?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony,
15   vague.
16             THE WITNESS:  Well, it's sort of a dual
17   purpose here.  The initial analysis that I did was
18   strictly a stress analysis --
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Right.
21         A.  -- because I wanted to see what kind of
22   differential expansion that you would expect to get
23   there, the stresses that you would expect to see,
24   and try to understand that mode of failure.
25             But as I learned more about the operation
0069
 1   of the heat exchanger and began to read more of the
 2   documents that were involved, the depositions and
 3   expert reports, I realized that there were some
 4   other questions that needed to be addressed, and I
 5   put pencil to paper and tried to understand those
 6   additional ideas that I wanted to develop.
 7         Q.  All right.  Sir, I'm going to hand you a
 8   document and I'm not going to mark it, but it was
 9   produced to us as part of your file in this case
10   last week.  It's titled Jones List of Documents.
11             Is this a document that you created, or is
12   this something that was created for you?
13         A.  This was created for me.  This information
14   was sent to me.
15         Q.  Okay.  Do you remember when you received
16   this list of documents that you're looking at?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts.
18             THE WITNESS:  I don't.  I really don't.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  All right.  There's essentially 290 broad
21   categories of different materials that appear to
22   reflect just about everything in this case.
23         A.  Correct.
24         Q.  Do you know whether you have seen with
25   your own eyes each of these materials that appear on
0070
 1   this list?
 2         A.  I would say just on the first page, I've
 3   probably seen 80 to 90 percent of them and looked at
 4   them.  Some I don't recognize.  Kelly Combos,
 5   Cambos, whatever it is, I don't remember her.
 6         Q.  Do you remember reviewing discovery
 7   responses at all from any party?
 8         A.  Yeah, I did.  I looked at discovery
 9   responses.
10         Q.  Okay.  How about legacy orders.
11             Do you know what legacy orders are?
12         A.  No, I don't.
13         Q.  Do you know what ERP orders are?
14         A.  What?
15         Q.  Do you know what ERP orders are?
16         A.  No.
17         Q.  Okay.  Have you looked at any contract
18   claims or warranty claims?
19         A.  No, I have not.
20         Q.  Do you know what Amtech is?
21         A.  No, I do not.
22         Q.  Okay.  How about MetrixClaimNonBr,
23   whatever that means.
24         A.  Where do you see that one?
25         Q.  It starts on Item 223 through 247.
0071
 1   There's a bunch of things called MetrixClaimNonBr.
 2             Do you have any idea what those are?
 3         A.  If I've seen those, they -- the name
 4   doesn't strike me as being familiar, so...
 5         Q.  All right.  I assume you have looked at
 6   the burner manual for the subject burner?
 7         A.  Extensively.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Have you looked at any repair
 9   records from either A&J or M&M?
10         A.  I have.
11         Q.  Do you know when you received copies of
12   any of these materials?
13         A.  I can't tell you that offhand.  Early on
14   in this case, I received a -- I was given a hard
15   drive which I used to copy these things onto my
16   computer.  Some of them I've looked at extensively
17   and some of this I never either didn't get around to
18   it or I didn't feel like I needed it for what I was
19   doing.
20         Q.  Have you looked at any of the testimony
21   for the individual plaintiffs in this case?
22         A.  I have.
23         Q.  Okay.  Does that play any role in the
24   opinions you intend to offer in this case, what the
25   plaintiffs are saying?
0072
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 2   overbroad.
 3             THE WITNESS:  The only -- the only
 4   exception I can think of -- most of them, I don't,
 5   but there's some -- some of the testimony talks
 6   about the carbon monoxide monitors going off, that
 7   sort of thing.  That was relevant to my opinions.
 8   Not so much the medical symptoms and that sort of
 9   thing.
10             And there was some testimony by I believe
11   one or two people about signing different documents
12   or when they got certain documents.  That might be
13   relevant, but that's all I can think of because most
14   of it is probably not in my area.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  Did you do any highlighting or
17   annotations of any of the materials that you've been
18   provided, other than the citations that we see
19   within your design notes?
20         A.  No.  Typically, what I do whenever I have
21   a case that has this many documents, once I reach
22   sort of a critical mass in my head of what the
23   hell's going on here, I start -- try to start a list
24   of my opinions that seem to be coming out of my
25   readings.
0073
 1             And so I will go on my screen and split it
 2   into -- I have my list of opinions or working
 3   opinions, and as I'm reading depositions, if I see
 4   something I think contributes to that, I'll -- I'll
 5   copy that and put it under -- in that opinion -- or
 6   in my notes here.
 7             And then once I get to the point where I'm
 8   ready to try to put together a final, I go in and
 9   edit that and I get rid of all of the actual
10   transcript document words and just reference that.
11   That's how I put this together.
12         Q.  Okay.
13         A.  It's an ongoing document.  I'm putting
14   information in, and it gets to be monstrous, and
15   then at the end of the day, I try to squeeze it all
16   back.  Instead of having the actual quotes in the
17   documents, I just reference them.
18         Q.  So you don't have any -- within your
19   office or your system at your office, you don't have
20   any hard copies or electronic copies of the source
21   documents that are highlighted or have notes beyond
22   the final copy of your design notes that cite
23   certain --
24         A.  This stack here.  I brought them.
25         Q.  Okay.  Let me take a look at those.
0074
 1         A.  Sure.  There were some that I did
 2   highlight, so I brought those with me.  But those
 3   documents would have been in your documents that we
 4   transmitted to you.
 5             (Document handed to counsel.)
 6             THE WITNESS:  Those are my working
 7   documents.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Okay.  So here's your work product back,
10   and we're going to go through those, so keep those
11   handy.  But it looks like you have the installation
12   instructions for the DRO2 ovens, which are Bates
13   stamped ITWFEG505 through 520.
14             That's one of the documents that you
15   annotated?
16         A.  Correct.
17         Q.  All right.  And if I can have that back.
18         A.  Sure.
19             (Document handed to counsel.)
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Sorry.  It appears that you have
22   highlighted and created some notes on Page 15 of
23   that document, which is Bates numbered ITWFEG519,
24   regarding the initial startup for the burner of the
25   oven.
0075
 1         A.  Correct.
 2         Q.  And you have highlighted some information
 3   and then you have some handwritten calculations in
 4   the bottom left-hand corner.
 5             Can you tell me what those calculations
 6   were intended to reflect?
 7         A.  Sure.  I was -- I looked at Item Number 9,
 8   and it talks about the burner, the gas settings.
 9   And according to this, if you set the gas regulator
10   to 2.8 inches of water column, you should be getting
11   about 318,000 BTUs of energy out of the heat
12   exchanger.
13         Q.  Okay.
14         A.  If you increase the gas pressure to 3.5
15   inches of water, then you get 375,000.  And I was
16   just curious to know is that a linear increase or is
17   that maybe a square root increase.
18         Q.  All right.  And did you determine whether
19   it was linear or something else?
20         A.  It's between the two.  It's somewhere in
21   the middle.
22         Q.  All right.  Do you understand the
23   relationship of the gas pressure to the thermal
24   units being created?
25         A.  Yeah.
0076
 1         Q.  Okay.  But it's somewhere between linear
 2   and --
 3         A.  Yeah, if I double the gas flow, I don't
 4   necessarily double the amount of BTUs that are
 5   coming out the other end.
 6         Q.  All right.  So it's nonlinear?
 7         A.  It's slightly more -- somewhere between
 8   the square root function and a lineal function,
 9   so...
10         Q.  Okay.  And is that -- the extent of the
11   understanding with regard to the relationship
12   between the gas pressure and the BTUs produced is
13   that it's somewhere between a square root function
14   and a linear function?
15         A.  And the only thing I can --- I mean it may
16   not be the theoretical approach, but if you're using
17   their numbers, that's what you get.
18         Q.  Okay.  And --
19             MR. JARCHI:  Object to the last question
20   as vague and ambiguous.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  All right.  And what you're talking about
23   is the gas pressure coming in and the BTUs being
24   created by the burner, then flowing into the heat
25   exchanger?
0077
 1         A.  Correct.
 2         Q.  Okay.  Let me go through some of the rest
 3   of these materials you brought with you from the
 4   file, and then maybe we'll take a quick break and
 5   get copies of anything I want to mark so you can
 6   have these back.
 7         A.  Sure.
 8         Q.  So you've also got in here an April 23,
 9   2002 communication from Mike Gumbert that's marked
10   as ITWFEG194 through 196.
11             There's no highlighting or notes on this,
12   but you do reference it within your design notes; is
13   that right?
14         A.  I do.
15         Q.  Okay.  And you reference it a number of
16   times so you just wanted to have a copy handy?
17         A.  Well, generally speaking, when I go to a
18   deposition, people ask me about certain things in my
19   notes, so I try to have it handy.
20         Q.  Okay.  Now, you also have a copy of an
21   August 15, 2002 communication Bates numbered
22   ITWFEG648 through 650.
23             Have you added anything to this document
24   other than the brackets that appear on ITWFEG649?
25         A.  No.
0078
 1         Q.  Okay.  So --
 2         A.  Make a copy of that page.
 3         Q.  Yeah.  And -- okay.  Then you've got a
 4   PowerPoint presentation, which is another one of the
 5   documents cited within your design notes?
 6         A.  It is.
 7         Q.  Okay.  And you have tabbed a page of that,
 8   which is identified as ITWFEG931, that talks about
 9   the potential factors affecting the creation of
10   carbon monoxide?
11         A.  Correct.
12         Q.  Okay.  And you also circled what looks
13   like the creation date for this PowerPoint of
14   sometime in 2007?
15         A.  Correct.
16         Q.  Any other -- no, it looks like maybe you
17   have -- in addition to the highlighting I talked
18   about, about the factors that can create carbon
19   monoxide, you've also identified the potential
20   effects of carbon monoxide and the variability of
21   those effects, depending on the individual person;
22   is that correct?
23         A.  Correct.
24         Q.  All right.  Now, the next document that
25   you have with you is an Atomatic Service Manual that
0079
 1   was produced as ITWFEG587 through 634, and it looks
 2   like you have a note on the first page that says
 3   "See bake cycle on Page 37."
 4             Is that your handwriting that appears on
 5   that, sir?
 6         A.  It is.
 7         Q.  Okay.  And then you also have a couple of
 8   tabs that appear to run from Pages 35 to 37 of that
 9   service manual?
10         A.  Correct.
11         Q.  And you have circled on here under the
12   Electrical Operation:
13                  "Component function 7CB
14             controls power to the burner
15             circuit."
16             Why was that important to you, or why did
17   you circle that?
18         A.  Because later in the document, they talk
19   about what happens, say, when you open the door.
20   That's different phases of operation.
21         Q.  Okay.
22         A.  And I followed through there to see
23   whenever they turned off and on different parts of
24   the system.
25         Q.  Okay.  And what did you learn from that
0080
 1   review, if anything?
 2         A.  That after you open the door, the -- it --
 3   after a certain amount of time, the burner -- well,
 4   the burner goes off, and then the exhaust fan on the
 5   stack continues to run for -- I think it's 20
 6   minutes afterwards.
 7         Q.  Okay.
 8         A.  But very shortly after this happens, they
 9   cut the power to the burner, so I'm just trying to
10   understand what's going on in the system.
11         Q.  Okay.  So your understanding for that
12   review, though, is that if you open the door of
13   certain things, power is terminated to those
14   operations, but one of the things you also saw is
15   that the stack fan or the draft inducer, whatever
16   you want to call it, continues running for about 20
17   minutes after combustion stops?
18         A.  Correct.
19         Q.  Okay.  Do you recall whether you reviewed
20   this service manual -- when you reviewed this
21   service manual for the first time?
22         A.  Probably early on in the -- in the case,
23   because I was trying to understand how this whole
24   thing worked.
25             Pretty complicated system, as you know,
0081
 1   and different things trigger different motors and
 2   fans and what have you.  So I was just trying to --
 3   like I said, trying to understand the operation of
 4   the oven.
 5         Q.  Did you go back and make those notations
 6   with regard to that specific circuit breaker and the
 7   effects of opening the door and whatnot before or
 8   after you reviewed Dr. Romig's deposition?
 9         A.  It was after.
10         Q.  Okay.  Do you remember if it was before or
11   after reading Dr. Galatsis's deposition?
12         A.  I don't remember.
13         Q.  Okay.  I'm going to hand you a document
14   marked as ITWFEG7749 and ask you if you can tell me
15   what this is and how, if at all, you rely upon it
16   for your opinions in this case.
17         A.  What this is is a bar chart showing the
18   number of heat exchangers that were replaced as a
19   result of -- or at least they were found to be
20   breached as a result of the 2002 --
21             MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.
22             Jackie, I think you unmuted the phone
23   accidentally.
24             MS. FREDERICK:  Sorry.
25             MR. CROSS:  And your dog's not happy about
0082
 1   something.
 2             MS. FREDERICK:  Well, a workman just
 3   arrived.  I'm sorry about that.
 4             THE WITNESS:  So anyway, this is basically
 5   a chart that indicates the relative number of heat
 6   exchangers that were found to be breached, have
 7   holes in the tubes --
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Okay.
10         A.  -- as a function of the year they were
11   made.
12         Q.  And did you do any analysis of the
13   underlying inspection findings, or did you simply
14   pull out and review this chart?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
16             THE WITNESS:  Well, I did do a review of
17   the inspection findings.  I have notebooks, several
18   notebooks that contained all of the different
19   inspection reports, and as you go through -- I
20   didn't want to go through their, what, 2,000 of them
21   or something like that.  I didn't want to go
22   through -- it would have been a good charging
23   opportunity, but it just didn't seem like a very
24   good use of my time.
25   ///
0083
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Did you make any determination of the
 3   number of heat exchangers that were inspected that
 4   were replacement heat exchangers versus heat
 5   exchangers that reflected original equipment at the
 6   time of inspection?
 7         A.  I did not.
 8         Q.  Okay.  And it appears we have some
 9   photographs of the subject heat exchanger, and these
10   are marked Dieter 32 through Dieter 34.
11             MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the evidence.
12             THE WITNESS:  No, those are not the
13   subject heat exchanger.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Okay.  What --
16         A.  Those are examples of other heat
17   exchangers that failed in a similar matter.
18         Q.  Okay.  And are these three photographs
19   three different heat exchangers?
20         A.  It is my understanding that that is the
21   case.
22         Q.  Okay.  And what is the source for the
23   Dieter photographs?
24         A.  Oh, I don't remember exactly.  It was just
25   one of the documents that was in my list of -- and I
0084
 1   think it would be in my notes here.
 2         Q.  All right.
 3         A.  But I don't remember off the top of my
 4   head.
 5         Q.  Do you have any information about the date
 6   of manufacture or service use for any of the heat
 7   exchangers reflected in Dieter 32 through Dieter 34?
 8         A.  It's probably available in the original
 9   documents.  I don't remember it off the top of my
10   head.
11         Q.  All right.  Other than I guess the
12   suggestion that there are heat exchangers other than
13   the subject oven that reflect I guess a comparable
14   type of failure mode, is there any other purpose for
15   your reference to the Dieter photographs?
16         A.  No.  The reason that I pulled those is
17   because I felt like that -- that this was a generic
18   problem as opposed to a specific problem.
19         Q.  And when you say "a generic problem," you
20   mean a problem that's not limited to the individual
21   product at issue but one that might be seen over
22   more than just that one product?
23         A.  No, not product.  It's generic in the
24   sense that it was a flaw in the design of the heat
25   exchanger which showed up in a number of -- of the
0085
 1   same -- of the heat exchangers that were in use.  It
 2   wasn't a single point failure that sometimes happens
 3   when you have a very unique situation but more of a
 4   generic problem to the design.
 5         Q.  Okay.  Certainly there are a number of
 6   data points that you have even from the graph
 7   limited alone that you looked at that suggest heat
 8   exchangers of the same design not identified as
 9   having failed; isn't that correct?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
11   incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  In fact, there's more that have not failed
14   and that have been identified as failed?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts.
16             THE WITNESS:  Well, I can't agree with
17   that -- that statement.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  Is it your opinion, based on the
20   information you've reviewed, that the DRO inspection
21   program identified more failed heat exchangers than
22   they did heat exchangers that were not cracked at
23   the time of inspection?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
25             THE WITNESS:  No, my opinion is that the
0086
 1   way that these heat exchangers were identified as
 2   being failed was extremely crude and did not
 3   necessarily identify heat exchangers that could have
 4   had hairline cracks or were beginning to start
 5   fatiguing and may be partially failed.
 6         Q.  All right.
 7         A.  So, you know, the way I remember it in the
 8   inspection program, you took the fan, the blower off
 9   the heat exchanger and took your trouble light and
10   inserted it as far as it would go into the heat
11   exchanger, and then you went around to the bake
12   chamber and you looked at that heat exchanger to see
13   if you could see light coming out.
14         Q.  Okay.
15         A.  Okay.  To get light to come out, you've
16   got to have a pretty good size hole.  There could
17   be --
18         Q.  How big a hole is it required for light to
19   pass through?
20             MR. JARCHI:  I don't think he's finished
21   his answer.
22             So could you please finish your answer?
23             THE WITNESS:  The hole there could have
24   been hairline cracked in all of them, and if they
25   were small cracks, they might not have shown up.
0087
 1   There could be partial cracks in all of them and you
 2   wouldn't see light coming through there.  But in
 3   every case, if you continued to use those heat
 4   exchangers, they could have resulted in a complete
 5   breach.
 6             So if you wanted to do a real inspection,
 7   you should have done something like a dye penetrant
 8   check, which means that you should put dye penetrant
 9   liquid on there and then use some type of a black
10   light to determine if you have a crack.
11             So in my humble opinion, the method used
12   to determine a failed heat exchanger was extremely
13   crude and wouldn't necessarily turn up all the
14   failures.
15         Q.  All right.
16         A.  So therefore, your answer to my question --
17   to answer your question, do I think that there could
18   be more heat exchangers or all could fail, it's
19   quite possible.
20         Q.  All right.  Let me follow up on a couple
21   questions, then.
22         A.  Sure.
23         Q.  How big has the hole got to be for light
24   to pass through it?
25         A.  It depends on the crack shape.  If you
0088
 1   have a V-shaped crack, light won't pass through it
 2   because it doesn't reflect very well.  In many
 3   cases, you will have a crack that is open whenever
 4   it's hot and closes up when it cools off, and you
 5   wouldn't see that crack except by dye penetrant
 6   methodology.
 7         Q.  Have you done any testing to demonstrate
 8   that ability to have a crack in the heat exchanger
 9   that would not be identifiable with the light test
10   that was used?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
12             THE WITNESS:  Not in this heat exchanger,
13   but in many cases of other cracked analysis, yes.
14   I've done that.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  Do you have any data to back up the
17   opinion that you've just offered that there -- oh,
18   I'm sorry.  You didn't even state it affirmatively.
19             Do you have any data to back up the
20   suggestion that there may be cracks present in heat
21   exchangers in 2002 that were not identified by the
22   inspection?
23         A.  I don't have any data, no.
24         Q.  Okay.  That's an idea you have; that given
25   the failure mode, there may have been issues with
0089
 1   some of these other heat exchangers that weren't
 2   identified with the method that was used to inspect
 3   them?
 4             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstates the
 5   testimony, vague and ambiguous.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  Is that an accurate statement of what you
 8   just told me, sir?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.
10             THE WITNESS:  Would you read that back to
11   me?  I have to check about the accuracy of the
12   statement to say yes or no.
13             (The record was read as follows:
14             Q.   That's an idea you have;
15             that given the failure mode,
16             there may have been issues with
17             some of these other heat
18             exchangers that weren't
19             identified with the method that
20             was used to inspect them?)
21             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.
22             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it's my opinion that
23   it's highly likely that there were cracks in other
24   heat exchangers that weren't identified.  These
25   hairline cracks may have closed when they cooled
0090
 1   down, but they're still open whenever it's heated
 2   up.
 3   BY MR. CROSS:
 4         Q.  Okay.  Do you have any objective data to
 5   support your opinion that there were present other
 6   cracks that were not identified?
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, asked
 8   and answered as to his prior experience, incomplete
 9   hypothetical.
10             THE WITNESS:  I have not measured -- I
11   have not done these tests because I've never had
12   access to the other heat exchangers.
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  Well, except for the one you looked at in
15   Irwindale with Dr. Romig; right?
16         A.  I didn't have to use dye penetrant to see
17   that crack.
18         Q.  Not the subject oven, but was there a
19   crack in the heat exchanger of the oven that you
20   looked at with Dr. Romig?
21         A.  I'm sorry.  I thought you were talking
22   about the Irwindale initial inspection.
23             MR. JARCHI:  They're both in Irwindale.
24             THE WITNESS:  They were one block away
25   from each other, for some strange reason.  So I
0091
 1   apologize.  I should differentiate.  Let's call it
 2   the Rest Your Case inspection of this Albertsons
 3   heat exchanger, and the other one was in a bakery, a
 4   resale oven.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  And it's your recollection that the
 7   exemplar or other oven you looked at with Dr. Romig
 8   earlier this year was at a facility within the
 9   vicinity of the Rest Your Case facility?
10         A.  Yes, they're a block away, yeah.  Sorry if
11   I confused that.
12         Q.  No, that's okay.
13             Now, earlier I thought you indicated you
14   had not -- or didn't recall whether you had done any
15   analysis of welds or failed welds in prior consulting.
16             When you were talking about crack
17   analysis, are you talking about cracks within
18   individual materials or cracks that you believe --
19   or cracks that were present in welds that you've
20   analyzed in unrelated cases?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Compound and vague.
22             THE WITNESS:  Well, what I first would say
23   is the way I remember the question you asked me
24   originally was have I ever done analysis of cracks
25   in heat exchangers of this type.
0092
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Well, first we started with that, and then
 3   we moved to bakery ovens generally and then we moved
 4   to combustion appliances.  So I asked you all three.
 5         A.  Yeah, but in terms of looking for cracks
 6   that were caused by thermal expansion or other
 7   causes and doing dye penetrant checks and that sort
 8   of thing, I've done a lot of that work over my
 9   career.
10         Q.  Okay.  But my question is:  The crack
11   analysis in the dye penetrant, is that something you
12   looked at with regard to hairline cracks, or
13   whatever term you want to use, in a single material
14   or within the weld joint of two -- of two pieces,
15   two components?
16         A.  Well, it's always two components.  You
17   hardly ever weld anything unless you're welding two
18   components together.
19         Q.  Well, I understand that.
20             My question is:  The crack analysis that
21   you've done in your history unrelated to this case,
22   was that looking at weld joints or was that looking
23   at components and failures of individual components?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
25             THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure what the
0093
 1   question means, but I will answer to say --
 2   BY MR. CROSS:
 3         Q.  Well, I want to make sure you understand
 4   my question.
 5         A.  Yeah, that's a good idea.
 6         Q.  You said you referenced having looked at
 7   crack -- or having done crack analysis and using
 8   this dye penetrant looking at hairline cracks and
 9   things that maybe would not be obvious with the use
10   of the light test.
11             Am I with you so far?
12         A.  Correct.
13         Q.  My question is:  With regard to that past
14   analysis you've done using the dye penetrant, was
15   that on a weld joint of two different pieces, or was
16   that looking at the integrity of a single component?
17         A.  No, it was a weld joint between two
18   different pieces.  I can give you an example if you
19   would like.
20         Q.  That would be helpful.
21         A.  Over the last few years, I've been
22   involved in doing the work on the Metrolink crash
23   that occurred here two years back.
24         Q.  Okay.
25         A.  And the plaintiff -- I'm working for
0094
 1   Hyundai, and we spent untold hours laying under
 2   locomotives doing dye penetrant checks of the
 3   components to find cracks that you can't see
 4   visually.  It was a visual inspection, but we had to
 5   go under and do dye penetrant as well as ultrasonic
 6   testing of all the cracks on all the pilots that
 7   were welded to the cars.  That's just one example.
 8         Q.  Okay.
 9         A.  Days of doing crack after crack.
10         Q.  And that analysis on that Link
11   investigation was looking specifically at cracks
12   that were appearing in the weld joints of two
13   different components -- or basically in weld joints?
14         A.  Correct.
15         Q.  Okay.
16         A.  And that's just one example.  I've done it
17   for all kinds of structural steel, pressure vessels,
18   piping.  Dye penetrant is a very commonly-used
19   method for looking for cracks, and weld shrinkage
20   can often result in these hairline cracks.
21         Q.  All right.  Now, you indicated that you
22   didn't need to use that penetrant for the subject
23   heat exchanger because the breaches were obvious to
24   the naked eye; correct?
25         A.  I indicated that the ones that were
0095
 1   completely failed were obvious because you didn't
 2   need dye penetrant to find those.  And the three
 3   examples that I gave you were examples where they
 4   had completely destroyed the interface at the weld.
 5         Q.  All right.  My question is:  Did you use
 6   dye penetrant to look at any of the other weld
 7   joints on the subject heat exchanger since it's
 8   something you're familiar with and you said it's
 9   relatively easy to do?
10         A.  I did not, no.
11         Q.  Okay.  For example, did you look at the
12   interactions between any of the stainless steel
13   tubes to carbon steel boxes to which they were
14   joined --
15             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  -- on the subject heat exchanger --
18             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  -- using dye penetrant.
21         A.  No, I did not use dye penetrant to do
22   that.  No, I didn't.
23         Q.  Okay.  So you didn't use dye penetrant in
24   your investigation of the subject heat exchanger for
25   any purpose?
0096
 1         A.  Well, best of my recollection, all of the
 2   weld joints between the carbon steel tubes and the
 3   stainless steel box were breached.
 4         Q.  Correct.
 5         A.  And so I didn't use dye penetrant.  It
 6   would have just fallen through the crack.
 7         Q.  My question, though, was with regard to
 8   the integrity of the weld joints that had not been
 9   breached.
10             Did you look at -- did you use dye
11   penetrant or any other technical analysis to assess
12   the integrity of those weld joints?
13         A.  I didn't, no.
14         Q.  Okay.  All right.  It looks like, then, we
15   have the individual invoices that underline your
16   ledger that we got produced last night?
17         A.  Correct.
18         Q.  Okay.  And then you have a -- it looks
19   like an ITWFEG organization chart circa 2002.
20             Is this something you created yourself?
21         A.  It is.
22         Q.  All right.  And for what purpose did you
23   create this organizational chart?
24         A.  Well, when I started reading the numerous
25   depositions involved in this case, I have to admit I
0097
 1   was a bit confused about who worked for who and
 2   when.  And so I put that together to try to -- so I
 3   could try to remember who was who and who they
 4   reported to and how they all related to each other.
 5         Q.  Okay.  Does this play any part in your
 6   opinions, other than understanding who did what?
 7         A.  No.
 8             MR. CROSS:  All right.  Well, I've been
 9   advised that we need to make a tape change, so why
10   don't we go off record for just a few minutes so we
11   can get that accomplished, and I may have a request
12   of Mr. Jarchi here.
13             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.
14   Time's 11:25 a.m.
15             (Whereupon, a recess was held
16             from 11:25 a.m. to 11:38 a.m.)
17             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the
18   beginning of Video Media Number 2 in the videotaped
19   deposition of J. Williams Jones.  Going back on the
20   record.  The time is 11:38 a.m.
21             MR. CROSS:  All right, sir.  We had a
22   quick break there to change the tape and also get
23   some copies of some stuff you brought with you
24   today.
25             I'm going to mark as Exhibit 2 the
0098
 1   installation instructions that we were talking about
 2   that you had the calculations to determine if there
 3   was a linear relationship between gas pressure and
 4   BTU.
 5             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 2 was
 6             marked for identification by the
 7             deposition reporter and is attached
 8             hereto.)
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Can you just confirm that's what we've
11   marked as Exhibit 2 for me?
12         A.  Yes, sir, it is.
13         Q.  You can have it back.
14         A.  I've got a copy.
15         Q.  We should have a pile of just the exhibits
16   so that will make it easier on us later.
17             Do you have the notice of deposition?
18   That should be Exhibit 1.  Right there (indicating).
19         A.  Is that one marked as an -- there we go,
20   1.
21         Q.  Yes.
22         A.  Good enough.
23         Q.  So I was going back through the list of
24   materials that we reviewed earlier, and the
25   reference on Number 248 to the Dieter documents, and
0099
 1   it says Dieter 1 through 29.
 2             We went over the three photographs which
 3   were apparently Dieter 32, 33, and 34.
 4             Do you know when you received the three
 5   documents marked as Dieter 32, 33 and 34?
 6         A.  I sure don't.  I do not have any
 7   recollection of when these documents were given to
 8   me.
 9         Q.  All right.
10         A.  Which ones are those?  What are your
11   numbers there?  You referred to them as on this
12   list?
13         Q.  Number 248.
14         A.  248.
15         Q.  So Number 248 on your list of materials
16   references Dieter 1 through 29.
17             Do you see that?
18         A.  Yes, I do.
19         Q.  And the three photographs we were talking
20   about are labeled Dieter 32, 33 and 34 --
21         A.  Right.
22         Q.  -- which are not referenced on your list
23   of materials.  So I'm just wondering if you know
24   when you received these three photographs.
25         A.  I just don't.  Sometimes when I'm looking
0100
 1   at this stuff, I just -- I just run it by, and if it
 2   doesn't seem to be something I need to know, I don't
 3   spend a lot of time with it.  But every now and
 4   again, I'll get a picture I like and I'll print it
 5   out.  I'm sure that's what happened in that case.
 6         Q.  Do you know how many total photographs you
 7   received that were marked with a Dieter Bates
 8   number?  Because we only have 1 through 29 listed on
 9   your list of materials.
10         A.  No, I don't know.
11         Q.  Did you -- do you know whether there were
12   any other photographs that were Bates labeled Dieter
13   that reflected heat exchanger breaches?
14         A.  I don't recall.  Again, I was probably
15   flipping through these documents and I saw those and
16   I printed them out.
17         Q.  All right.  Were they just photographs, or
18   was there other information available?
19         A.  I don't remember.
20         Q.  So, for example, you indicated to me that
21   these were all heat exchangers that were different
22   than the subject heat exchanger that had had a
23   similar failure mechanism.
24             Are Dieter 32 and 34 the same or different
25   heat exchangers?
0101
 1         A.  I couldn't tell, so I printed them both
 2   up.  But they look very similar.  It could be the
 3   same thing.
 4         Q.  Okay.  Do you know whether these heat
 5   exchangers all came from a DRO oven?
 6         A.  I don't know, sitting here today.  I'd
 7   have to do the research.
 8         Q.  Okay.  That's not something you've done so
 9   far?
10         A.  Whenever, you know, I was looking at
11   these, I thought to myself this is not just a single
12   failure.  I was looking to see if it was something
13   that happened more than once, and I knew that there
14   were cracks in something like 30 of the heat
15   exchangers that were -- I'm sorry, not 30 -- there
16   were how many?  300 of them failed in your test,
17   303, if I remember, and I just wanted to get an
18   idea.  I doubt that they were all that bad, but...
19         Q.  And you understand that -- or you assumed,
20   I guess, that at least we have pictures of two if
21   not three other heat exchangers that you assumed
22   came from a DRO and that were identified as breached
23   and produced by somebody called Dieter?
24         A.  Correct.  That was my understanding.
25         Q.  Do you remember how you came to that
0102
 1   understanding, other than the fact that -- I don't
 2   know -- they looked to be potentially similar heat
 3   exchangers?  Did you have any other information
 4   about those photographs or the source or what they
 5   represented?
 6         A.  As I sit here today, I can't recall, but
 7   they certainly do look like the same heat exchanger
 8   to me.
 9         Q.  Okay.  One of the last documents that I
10   haven't asked you about is a communication dated
11   December 2, 2004 from Nigel Mills and was marked as
12   ITWFEG1060 through 1063.
13             Can you tell me for what purpose you
14   pulled that document?
15         A.  For one thing, it has a nice description
16   of the normal operation of the burner and the whole
17   heat exchanger, and that was useful to me.
18         Q.  And did that summary comport with your
19   review of the instruction manual for the burner in
20   terms of how it operates?
21         A.  Pretty much.  There may be some difference
22   in 34 seconds or 38 seconds or whatever the number
23   would be, but it looked like about the same thing to
24   me.  And I think that Mr. Mills here, he also
25   provided some explanations, which, as an engineer, I
0103
 1   found helpful, you know.
 2             If you look at the numbers on the
 3   instruction, it says it runs for such and such, but
 4   Mr. Mills, being a physicist, he says the purge time
 5   is sufficiently long to fully flush the brush and
 6   products in the uncompromised heat exchanger.
 7             I use that kind of information.  It's very
 8   useful as an engineer to understand the design.
 9   Because it's one thing to just look at the cold,
10   hard facts of what it's doing, but it's another
11   thing to try to understand there's got to be a rhyme
12   and reason for doing something some way, and the
13   more you understand about it, the better off you are
14   in terms of trying to understand and analyze it.  So
15   that's why I pulled this one out.  It gave me some
16   good information.
17         Q.  So it basically summarized the various
18   factual information that appeared in the burner
19   manual and also provided additional context for some
20   of those operations?
21         A.  Exactly.
22         Q.  That's what it seemed like, but I wanted
23   to make sure I understood.
24         A.  It just helps.  When somebody explains it
25   to you and gives you a little bit more detail, it's
0104
 1   always helpful.
 2             MR. CROSS:  All right.  I'm going to mark
 3   as Exhibit 3 two documents I've stapled together,
 4   one of which was the retention letter from July 18,
 5   2017 that was produced to us, and the other is the
 6   ledger of charges from this case that you and I
 7   talked about earlier.
 8             THE WITNESS:  Okay.
 9             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 3 was
10             marked for identification by the
11             deposition reporter and is attached
12             hereto.)
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  Can you confirm for me that the two
15   documents we've marked as Exhibit 3 are the
16   retention letter for your retention in this case as
17   well as the general ledger reflecting the invoices
18   that you have submitted in this case for work
19   performed?
20         A.  They are.
21             MR. CROSS:  All right.  I'm going to mark
22   as Exhibit 4 the individual invoices that you have
23   brought with you today and that we got sent last
24   night that relate to the information we saw in the
25   general ledger identified as Exhibit 3.
0105
 1             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 4 was
 2             marked for identification by the
 3             deposition reporter and is attached
 4             hereto.)
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Can you confirm for me that the invoice --
 7   invoices we have marked collectively as Exhibit 4
 8   comprise all of the invoices you have submitted to
 9   Mr. Jarchi to date for the work that you have done
10   in this case?
11         A.  They are.
12         Q.  All right.
13         A.  Do you want me to put this in the pile?
14         Q.  Yeah.  Hold on to the Exhibit 4 invoices,
15   if you would.
16             All right.  So if I'm looking at --
17   actually, I lied.  I misrepresented.  You may still
18   want that ledger.
19             If I look at your general ledger, it looks
20   like through September 3rd, 2019 you have billed a
21   total of $112,200 for work in this case; is that
22   right?
23         A.  That's correct.
24         Q.  All right.  And it also appears that the
25   vast majority, more than $80,000, was billed during
0106
 1   just the past four months?
 2         A.  I think that's right, yeah.
 3         Q.  All right.  So I want to talk with you a
 4   little bit about the work you did both earlier in
 5   this case and then the work you've done more
 6   recently in the last four months, and we will do
 7   that going through Exhibit 4, the individual
 8   invoices; okay?
 9         A.  Okay.
10         Q.  All right.  So it looks like the retainer
11   letter that you sent out on July 18, 2017 was
12   answered, and within a month, you were actually
13   given a $2,000 retainer on August 17th of 2017; is
14   that right?
15         A.  Apparently.  I don't do the bookkeeping,
16   but that sure looks right.
17         Q.  Okay.  And then the first invoice that you
18   billed against that retainer was from November --
19   I'm sorry -- was for work done during October of
20   2017.  You billed that on November 1st.
21         A.  Correct.
22         Q.  All right.  As I go through your October
23   individual invoice, you indicate that you
24   inspected -- you did an inspection at Rest Your
25   Case.
0107
 1             Was that the inspection of the subject
 2   heat exchanger?
 3         A.  It was.
 4         Q.  All right.  Did you inspect any other
 5   aspects of the subject oven, other than the heat
 6   exchanger, at that initial inspection?
 7         A.  Yes.
 8         Q.  And what else did you inspect?
 9         A.  There were a number of pieces of the heat
10   exchanger in various stages of disassembly.  There
11   was the basic box itself, and then there was the
12   steam unit, if I remember, some portions of the
13   steam unit.
14         Q.  Where there was the balls, the structure
15   that looked like sort of individual racks of balls?
16         A.  I believe so.
17         Q.  Okay.
18         A.  I didn't -- I wasn't as concerned with
19   those.  Photographs -- if you really want to see
20   exactly what I have, I sent you my photographs from
21   that date, and they would reflect everything I saw
22   there at the inspection.
23         Q.  Okay.  So everything of interest to you
24   during the initial inspection are reflected within
25   the photographs you have produced from that
0108
 1   inspection?
 2         A.  Correct.
 3         Q.  Did you take any notes of that initial
 4   inspection?
 5         A.  I didn't.
 6         Q.  All right.  You indicate in addition to
 7   the inspection that took place on October 5th, 2017,
 8   you had spent about four hours reading background
 9   information.
10             Do you remember what initial information
11   you were provided?
12         A.  That was one hour; right?
13         Q.  Well, you had one hour on the 1st and an
14   hour and a half on the 3rd and an hour and a half on
15   the 4th.
16         A.  Sure.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  By that time, I
17   had received a number of documents, and I was sort
18   of reading through those documents to see what the
19   case was about.
20             I try to prepare for an inspection because
21   if I had known what happened, you know, the cause,
22   it helps me determine what to look for when I go see
23   this.  And since the documents indicated that it was
24   a heat exchanger problem, then I would concentrate
25   more of my time looking at the heat exchanger
0109
 1   problem rather than other parts that might be
 2   available.  So that's why I do that research
 3   initially.
 4         Q.  Okay.  And I get all that.
 5             But my question, I guess, is:  What is the
 6   nature of the background information?  Were you were
 7   provided legal pleadings?  Were you provided
 8   technical documents?  What information did you spend
 9   four hours reviewing prior to inspecting the heat
10   exchanger?
11         A.  My answer is there was a whole bunch of
12   interrogatories and they were very voluminous, and I
13   read down through there and tried to understand from
14   the interrogatories and the responses what was going
15   on with the case.  And I can't remember, but there
16   were a number of those documents.
17         Q.  Did you receive any design documents or
18   drawings or anything like that prior to signing the
19   protective order that you produced as part of your
20   file?
21         A.  No.
22         Q.  Okay.  So anything you had reviewed prior
23   to your initial inspection in October of 2017 would
24   have been material that was not designated as
25   confidential?
0110
 1         A.  That's my understanding.
 2             MR. JARCHI:  It's vague and ambiguous,
 3   but -- yeah.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  All right.  After your inspection, about
 6   three weeks later, it looks like you spent two hours
 7   on analysis.
 8             Is that the stress analysis you did, or
 9   what were you analyzing in late October of 2017?
10         A.  That was when I first sat down with the
11   information that I had and tried to determine
12   roughly what the stresses would be at that juncture
13   with the similar metals.
14             And it was just a brief set of -- almost
15   like back-of-the-envelope calculations, to see --
16   you know, one of the things you do as an engineer is
17   you try to postulate different failure modes and
18   then you do rough calculations to see if those
19   failure modes make sense to you.
20             There's no use to do a detailed analysis
21   that's going to take you a week to do if you can
22   prove up front that's not the problem.
23             So you try to eliminate the things that
24   aren't the problem and discover the things that
25   probably are the problem.
0111
 1             And I was doing that initially just to
 2   kind of get a feel for the level of stress and the
 3   discontinuity and that sort of thing.
 4         Q.  All right.  So on the 25th, it looks like
 5   maybe then what you're telling me is you did a
 6   review of the information you gathered and a very
 7   broad overview type analysis to see if there was
 8   something worth investigating further, and then you
 9   have five hours that it looks like you spent five
10   days later when you say specifically calculating
11   thermal stresses.
12         A.  Correct.
13         Q.  So was that a more detailed analysis that
14   you performed trying to identify the specific
15   stresses present on the heat exchanger?
16         A.  Yeah, and it includes things -- once you
17   identify what you're going to do, then you need to
18   get material properties, and so you have to start
19   looking for the right source of material properties,
20   and these material properties have to be a function
21   of temperature.  So, you know, that's when you start
22   gathering the information that you're going to need
23   to do the more detailed work.
24         Q.  And the five hours that you did on
25   October 30th, 2017, was that all closed handwork, or
0112
 1   did that include any of the finite element analysis?
 2         A.  It was all hand calculations.
 3         Q.  Okay.  So that's gathering the data,
 4   running the calculations, checking them, and
 5   basically just doing a more detailed assessment of
 6   the stresses involved on the heat exchanger?
 7         A.  Correct.
 8         Q.  And it looks like the next day you spent
 9   four hours on something called PPT.
10             Was that a PowerPoint?
11         A.  Yeah.  I wanted to get an understanding of
12   how the flow was going through the heat exchanger.
13             So, many times whenever I'm doing these,
14   it helps me if I will create a model in PowerPoint
15   or Word or whatever document, whatever -- I don't
16   have a drawing program per se; I just tend to use
17   those, and then I create the outline, put in the
18   dimensions and that sort of thing and then try to
19   get a visualization of what's going on inside the
20   heat exchanger, and that's what that was.  And I
21   subsequently used that to help our animators create
22   the animation.
23         Q.  Okay.  I have not seen that PowerPoint.
24             Do you have it with you?
25         A.  It's incorporated in my stress analysis.
0113
 1         Q.  Okay.  Are you talking about Figure 2 on
 2   Page 3 of your Analysis of Heater Tube Failure?
 3         A.  That's part of it, yeah.  I think there's
 4   other figures in there that I created using that
 5   technique.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Now, I've got on Figure 3 a couple
 7   photographs.  One's showing general, and one's more
 8   of a blowup showing the actual breaches of the heat
 9   exchanger.
10             Was that part of your PowerPoint?
11         A.  Yeah, I would bring in the pictures in the
12   PowerPoint and then do notations, that sort of
13   thing.  So it makes a nice photograph that I can
14   refer to -- or makes a nice figure, not a
15   photograph.
16         Q.  How many slides were involved in the
17   PowerPoint you created on October 31st, 2017?
18         A.  Just the ones you see.
19         Q.  Just the two that are included within your
20   heat tube -- analysis of heat tube failure?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
22             THE WITNESS:  Or if there are just two.  I
23   don't know.  Whatever they are is what it was.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  Okay.  In terms of the PowerPoint you
0114
 1   created in October 30, 2017, is the entirety of the
 2   slides you created included within your analysis of
 3   heater tube failure that you've produced to us, or
 4   were there other sides that have not been produced?
 5         A.  As far as I know, you got them all.  Now,
 6   remember, it didn't take me four hours to do that
 7   slide.  It took me four hours of trial and error to
 8   get what I wanted.
 9         Q.  Sure.
10         A.  So it's not exactly -- you know, it's not
11   like I can sit down and have a picture in my head
12   that I'm putting on there.  It's one of those things
13   that you develop over -- you do some analysis, you,
14   you know, work on the picture.
15             Without the pictures, it's hard to explain
16   to somebody what you're doing.
17         Q.  No, I understand.
18             And so one of the two PowerPoint slides
19   that appear in your analysis of heater tube failure
20   shows diagrams of gases flowing through the
21   serpentine tubes.
22         A.  Correct.
23         Q.  Is that information you provided to what
24   you referred to as the animators?
25         A.  I did.
0115
 1         Q.  Who are the animators?
 2         A.  I don't know who are the animators.
 3         Q.  Did you provide slides directly to
 4   somebody or to Mr. Jarchi?
 5         A.  I gave them to Rob.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Did you ever talk with these
 7   unidentified animators at any time?
 8         A.  Yeah.  There was one time I was sitting in
 9   Rob's office.  He called him up, and I told him what
10   I was looking for.  He apparently had received that
11   picture, and I explained to him what I was trying to
12   show with the picture.
13         Q.  Okay.  Did you, in your PowerPoint in
14   October of 2017, attempt to illustrate any portions
15   of the oven, other than the heat exchanger itself?
16         A.  No, I don't think so.  I can't remember it
17   if I did.
18         Q.  So you didn't show the convection -- the
19   convection fan flows or the bake chamber of the
20   oven?
21         A.  Actually, it does show the convection fan
22   flows.
23         Q.  Well, I know the animation does.  I'm
24   asking about the --
25         A.  The PowerPoint shows it that you just had.
0116
 1         Q.  Okay.  Let me go ahead and mark this,
 2   then, because you're going to have to point that out
 3   for me.
 4         A.  Okay.
 5             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 5 was
 6             marked for identification by the
 7             deposition reporter and is attached
 8             hereto.)
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Oh, I see.  I see what you're talking
11   about now.
12         A.  I mean it's relatively crude.  I'm not
13   saying it's...
14         Q.  So we've marked as Exhibit 5 what you've
15   titled Analysis of Heater Tube Failure.
16         A.  Right.
17         Q.  And there's a big blue arrow that talks
18   about arrow -- or that talks about air flowing
19   totally outside of the heat exchanger; is that
20   correct?
21         A.  Oven Air - Crossflow through Tubes.
22         Q.  All right.  And we're talking about
23   Figure 2 of Exhibit 5?
24         A.  Correct.
25         Q.  Okay.  And is that the sole depiction you
0117
 1   created back in October of 2017 reflecting the
 2   convection fan flow?
 3         A.  It is.  What I tried to show there, and I
 4   think it helped the animator, I used colors to
 5   depict the airflow through there, and as the air
 6   goes through there you're losing heat to the
 7   convection fan.
 8         Q.  Uh-huh.
 9         A.  So you see that it started out as red and
10   you got -- I have to apologize.  I'm colorblind, but
11   it looks to me like it's getting lighter in color to
12   indicate that they're taking heat out of the heat
13   exchanger.
14             And the blue I used because it was cooler
15   coming through there to cause the -- to pick up the
16   heat from the heat exchanger.
17         Q.  Okay.  Because this is going to be
18   potentially confusing on the video record, can you
19   hold that up so we can see a picture of Figure 2
20   that you've just been discussing for us?
21         A.  (Witness complied.)
22         Q.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.
23         A.  Sure.
24         Q.  And really my question, then, is:  You've
25   got the cross flow of air moving across the heat
0118
 1   exchanger tubes and having the effect in terms of
 2   drawing some of the heat away that you talked about.
 3             Did you do any other PowerPoint slides to
 4   show how that warmed-up convection air leaves the
 5   heat exchanger and enters the bake chamber of the
 6   oven?
 7         A.  I did not.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Did you create any slides that
 9   showed or reflected alleged flows within the bake
10   chamber as opposed to what we see here with the heat
11   exchanger?
12         A.  No.
13         Q.  Okay.  Did you create any slides that
14   showed flow dynamics or ventilation as you open the
15   door of the bake chamber and where that air goes as
16   you open the door of the bake chamber?
17         A.  No.  The closest thing I have is this
18   hand-drawn sketches that I did when I did the
19   analysis of the hood area.
20         Q.  Okay.  And that's the analysis you did on
21   August 30th or 31st?
22         A.  Couple weeks ago.
23         Q.  Yeah, okay.  But that's not anything to
24   your knowledge that was shared with the animators?
25         A.  No.
0119
 1         Q.  Okay.  Other than the two figures that
 2   appear in Exhibit 5 that you believe were part of
 3   your PowerPoint, are you aware of any other
 4   information you created that was provided to these
 5   unidentified animators?
 6         A.  No.
 7         Q.  I just don't know what else to call them.
 8         A.  We can call them the mystery animators.  I
 9   don't know.
10         Q.  I like that even better.
11             MR. CROSS:  Mr. Jarchi, just because the
12   witness seems somewhat unsure, do you know whether
13   the entirety of the PowerPoint he created has been
14   produced as part of his file?
15             MR. JARCHI:  I assume what he's testified
16   to, I believe he believes it has been.  That's all I
17   know.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  Okay.  So to your knowledge, you created
20   two PowerPoint slides on October 31, 2017, and those
21   were the only two slides that reflect your work
22   product that were sent to the mystery animators?
23             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
24   ambiguous.
25             THE WITNESS:  Correct.
0120
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  All right.  So the next -- the next
 3   invoice we have is dated December 1st, and it
 4   reflects work that you spent.  It looks like, five
 5   and a half hours during November of 2017 with the
 6   description of Report.
 7             What report or reports did you create
 8   during November of 2017 over those five hours?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation at this
10   point.
11             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  Best of my
12   recollection, I was working on this analysis of the
13   heater tube failure.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Okay.  That's the Exhibit 5 document that
16   we've marked?
17         A.  Correct.
18         Q.  Okay.  Do you believe you had started your
19   notes regarding the design of the heat exchanger as
20   early as 2017?
21         A.  Let's make sure I know which notes you're
22   referring to.
23             MR. CROSS:  Yeah.  Let me go ahead and
24   mark those just so you can see what I'm referring
25   to.

 1             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 5B was
 2             marked for identification by the
 3             deposition reporter and is attached
 4             hereto.)
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Sir, I'm handing you what we have marked
 7   as Exhibit 5B, and it shows two pages of graph data.
 8             I want to just ask you:  Does the graph
 9   data appearing in Exhibit 5B relate to the analysis
10   of heat tube failure that we've marked as Exhibit 5?
11         A.  Yes, it does.
12             MR. JARCHI:  I apologize.  Is there an
13   Exhibit 5A?
14             MR. CROSS:  Well, it's Exhibit 5 and then
15   5B.
16             MR. JARCHI:  Got it.
17             MR. CROSS:  And then -- and I'm also going
18   to hand you a single page that reflects some -- a
19   couple of charts of data as well as another graph
20   and ask you if that information we've marked as
21   Exhibit 5C also relates to the heat tube failure
22   analysis document that we've marked as Exhibit 5.

 1             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 5C was
 2             marked for identification by the
 3             deposition reporter and is attached
 4             hereto.)
 5             THE WITNESS:  Yes, it does.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  Okay.  And in fact there are some excerpts
 8   from the various data marked in 5B and 5C within
 9   Exhibit 5 itself, are there not?
10         A.  I don't recall, but you're probably right.
11         Q.  We're going to come back and talk about
12   those at some length, but I wanted to make sure we
13   didn't lose those in the shuffle.
14         A.  Okay.
15             MR. CROSS:  All right.  So what I was
16   looking for and what we'll mark as Exhibit 6 is a
17   17-page document that says Notes of Doctor J.
18   William Jones.
19             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 6 was
20             marked for identification by the
21             deposition reporter and is attached
22             hereto.)
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  I'm going to ask you if you recognize that
25   document and if you created it.
0123
 1         A.  It looks very familiar.
 2         Q.  All right.  And would you -- would you
 3   agree that that reflects your analysis of the design
 4   of the heat exchanger, separate and apart from the
 5   stress and opined failure mode of the subject heat
 6   failure --
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  -- heat exchanger is what I mean.
10             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates testimony, vague.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  What's reflected in the notes we've marked
13   as Exhibit 6?
14         A.  I would -- my characterization of this
15   would be these are my opinions regarding the design
16   of the heat exchanger.
17         Q.  All right.  And those opinions regarding
18   the design of the heat exchanger, how it was
19   designed, et cetera, are separate and apart from the
20   earlier analysis you did of the thermal stresses
21   imposed and the manner in which the heat exchanger
22   failed; is that correct?
23         A.  Well, my opinions are based in great part
24   on the analysis that I did.
25         Q.  Right.  But this is a follow-on or
0124
 1   subsequent work that you did after that initial
 2   analysis of the stresses imposed and the manner of
 3   failure of the heat exchanger?
 4         A.  That's correct.
 5         Q.  All right.  Do you recall when you first
 6   started working on the document we've marked as
 7   Exhibit 6?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Calls for speculation.
 9             THE WITNESS:  It was probably around the
10   first of the year, something like that.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  Okay.  So let's keep walking through these
13   and see if we can figure that out.
14             So we've looked at the November -- I'm
15   sorry, the December 1st, 2017, and you've identified
16   for us as -- within Exhibit 5 and 5B and 5C the
17   reports that you worked on at that time at the end
18   of November -- oh, I'm sorry -- at the end of 2017.
19             The next invoice I see is dated July 11th,
20   2018, and it includes a half hour phone call.
21             Do you have any recollection what that
22   phone call was about?
23         A.  Oh, I sure don't.
24         Q.  Okay.  Did you perform any other work
25   between creating the documents we see in Exhibits 5,
0125
 1   5B and 5C and that phone call that's referenced?
 2         A.  Best of my recollection, I didn't work on
 3   the project.
 4         Q.  Okay.  So in that six-, seven-month
 5   period, you didn't do any additional work on it?
 6         A.  If I had less effort, yes, to put my hours
 7   down, which I have to tell you happens from time to
 8   time.  My wife is always giving me a hard time about
 9   that.  But unless I forgot to put the hours down,
10   she will bill them if I put them in the computer.
11   So...
12         Q.  All right.  So more likely than not, you
13   didn't do any other work after completing your
14   report, other than taking this call in late June of
15   2018?
16         A.  Probably not.
17         Q.  Okay.  And then the next charge we have is
18   on an invoice dated October 1st, 2018.  So now we're
19   a year after you wrote your report and there's a
20   one-hour charge that's identified only as Bakery HX
21   Rob.
22             Can you tell me what you did for an hour
23   on September 6 of 2018 that related to Bakery HX
24   Rob?
25         A.  I don't know.  Probably had a call.
0126
 1   That's all I can think of.
 2         Q.  You think you talked to Mr. Jarchi about
 3   the bakery heat exchanger?
 4         A.  Probably.  I don't recall the details of
 5   the conversation, but I'm sure that's what it was
 6   related to.
 7         Q.  All right.  Now, as we move on forward,
 8   there is a February 1st, 2019 invoice, and it
 9   reflects work you did throughout January, about ten
10   hours reviewing depositions and exhibits.
11         A.  Right.
12         Q.  Do you recall which depositions and
13   exhibits you started analyzing in January of this
14   year?
15         A.  I don't remember the details of it.  There
16   were so many of them.  And when I read these
17   depositions, they were all -- they were all
18   electronically -- given to me electronically, and so
19   I bring them up on my computer and I just sit there
20   and read it.
21             If it's -- I try to skip through the part
22   about the admonitions, have you ever been deposed
23   before, and get straight down to the meat of it, and
24   then whenever I -- I try to find things that relate
25   to some opinions that I'm looking for.
0127
 1             And like I said, I will just cut and paste
 2   pieces and put it in my work sheet here -- that ends
 3   up being this document -- and go to the next
 4   deposition and do that.
 5             And as I go along, then I try to
 6   categorize these things as are these design related
 7   to the design, related to the inspection, related to
 8   the -- whatever process, and I just try to have
 9   broad categories.
10             And I've found it helpful in my business
11   to just -- if it's over like a half a page, I'll
12   just copy that and paste it on my document here
13   because, quite honestly, with -- I probably read 40
14   depositions or something like that, I'm guessing,
15   estimating, and I --
16         Q.  That's pretty good in 14 hours.
17         A.  Huh?
18         Q.  I said that's pretty good in 14 hours.
19         A.  Well, I didn't read them all in that
20   month.  But, yeah.  Yeah, I'm a pretty fast reader,
21   and I have to tell you, reading depositions is not
22   my favorite task of all.
23         Q.  I don't blame you.
24         A.  I'd rather read a good novel, but
25   depositions are a necessary evil.
0128
 1         Q.  Have you read "The Last Viking"?  I hear
 2   it's good.
 3         A.  Can't wait till they make a movie out of
 4   it.
 5         Q.  I bet not.
 6             All right, sir.  The next invoice dated
 7   May 1st, 2019 includes a reference to a report on
 8   design, or at least a couple references to it.
 9         A.  Which one?
10         Q.  I'm looking at the May 1st, 2019 invoice
11   which includes work done in April.
12         A.  Okay.
13         Q.  And you've got a couple different
14   references to writing a report on design.
15         A.  Yeah, that's when I'm working on this
16   (indicating).
17         Q.  Okay.  And so when you say "this," you're
18   talking about the document we've marked as
19   Exhibit 6?
20         A.  Exhibit 6, yeah.
21         Q.  Okay.  And was that document then started
22   during the spring of 2019?
23         A.  Yes.
24         Q.  And was that a request for additional work
25   I guess from Mr. Jarchi's office beyond what you had
0129
 1   originally been tasked with back in 2017?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, assumes
 3   facts.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  That's why I'm asking the question.
 6         A.  Yeah.  I don't do work unless the attorney
 7   that's retained me asks me to do something.  I don't
 8   just sit around and charge up hours.
 9         Q.  So is this additional work that you were
10   asked to do sometime during 2019?
11         A.  I was told that we're getting close to the
12   time we're going to start having depositions and I
13   should read some of these people's being deposed and
14   read through some of the additional material that he
15   sent me.
16         Q.  Okay.  Do you recall what the documents
17   and drawings were that you reviewed in April of
18   2019?  Did they relate to the heat exchanger?  Were
19   they something else?
20         A.  Well, almost everything I reviewed related
21   to the heat exchangers.
22         Q.  Okay.  So that was the focus of your
23   analysis of the oven and the heat exchanger and its
24   operation?
25         A.  Correct.
0130
 1         Q.  All right.  There is reference in your
 2   June 1st invoice.  This is work done in May of 2019.
 3   It looks like you're reading a lot more depositions.
 4         A.  I did.  No doubt about it.
 5         Q.  But I wanted to ask you about the final
 6   entry on May 31st.  It just says Pressure Switch.
 7         A.  Yeah.
 8         Q.  Do you recall what you did for about an
 9   hour involving the pressure switch on May 31st?
10         A.  Yeah, I did.  When I read some of these
11   depos, Lee and Casto and Mills, especially Casto and
12   Mills, they seemed to almost believe that the
13   pressure switch was some kind of a magic wand that
14   if you put a pressure switch on, then you couldn't
15   get carbon monoxide.
16             So I went on the Internet and I did
17   research of various people who make pressure
18   switches, and there's all kinds of good information
19   out there, things on YouTube that you can watch
20   people.  So I tried to learn as much as I could
21   about pressure switches.
22         Q.  All right.  And do you recall any of the
23   manufacturers of the pressure switches that you saw
24   on the Internet during that hour?
25         A.  I do not, I have to tell you.  But I
0131
 1   did -- I think I looked at the ones -- I tried to
 2   look at the ones -- Honeywell was one of the ones I
 3   looked at, and I can't remember the other
 4   manufacturers.
 5             But best of my recollection, there were a
 6   couple that were used by ITW in their design, and I
 7   remember looking, searching for those, and then, you
 8   know how the Internet is.  It leads you right
 9   down -- it's the greatest time waster ever invented.
10   You can spend an hour looking and you end up three
11   hours later still looking at something.
12             There's a lot of information about
13   pressure switches, people describing how they
14   worked, how they install them, and I tried to watch
15   as much of that as I could.
16         Q.  What's your understanding of the operation
17   and purpose of pressure switches installed on the
18   subject oven?
19             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
20   incomplete hypothetical.
21             THE WITNESS:  My understanding of the
22   pressure switch is that the pressure switch measures
23   the pressure inside of the combustion chamber, or
24   when you turn the blower on for the burner, the fan
25   is supposed to start up.
0132
 1             You have a small fan motor.  It's an
 2   eighth of a horsepower, or something like that, not
 3   a very big motor, and it runs a squirrel cage fan,
 4   and it blows air into the combustion chamber.
 5             It's a big cylinder.  It's like 12 inches
 6   in diameter, if I remember, in that neighborhood,
 7   and when you blow air into this combustion chamber,
 8   you will build up a certain pressure.  The reason
 9   is, because there's a back pressure of pushing air
10   through the heat exchanger, it takes quite a bit of
11   pressure differential to blow air through this
12   thing.
13             So as you're blowing air into the
14   combustion chamber, you will increase the pressure
15   in the combustion chamber with respect to the
16   ambient condition, and your pressure switches, if I
17   recall, were set so that if you're between 1 and
18   1.4, or something like that, inches of water,
19   then -- then the computer that's in the heater,
20   modular combustion blower, that computer recognizes
21   that the fan is on.  That's how it knows that air is
22   coming into the combustion chamber.
23             And the pressure switch then is really
24   just a device so that whenever the pressure
25   differential reaches a certain amount, then it -- it
0133
 1   is taught to believe that the fan is running, and so
 2   now it knows that air should be being blown into the
 3   combustion chamber.
 4             And that's all it does.  It just
 5   recognizes that there are -- that there is a blower
 6   blowing into the combustion chamber.
 7         Q.  All right.  Is the -- do you know whether
 8   the purpose of that is to ensure that you don't
 9   ignite the burner with an overly-rich mixture; that
10   you make sure make sure that there's plenty of air
11   blowing into the burner, as you say, before you
12   ignite the burner?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
14   ambiguous and calls for speculation, depending on
15   who the -- just leave it at that.
16             THE WITNESS:  Well, my understanding of it
17   is basically twofold.
18             Number one, it's blowing air into the
19   combustion chamber, and you don't want to start
20   putting gas in there before you have air flowing
21   through it.
22             And the second function of the pressure
23   switch and the blower is to evacuate all products of
24   combustion or whatever's left in the heat exchanger
25   and start out with clean, fresh air, theoretically,
0134
 1   in through the heat exchanger and all the way up
 2   through the exhaust duct.  And that's why you run it
 3   for 30 -- 30-something seconds before you try to
 4   ignite the burner.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Okay.  That's what they call the purge
 7   cycle?
 8         A.  You could call it a purge cycle.
 9         Q.  All right.  Now, you referenced something
10   about back pressure.
11             Did you take any measurements of any heat
12   exchanger to try and quantify this alleged back
13   pressure that exists in the heat exchanger?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
15             THE WITNESS:  I did not take any
16   measurements, no.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Have you done any calculations to try and
19   quantify the back pressure you believe is present
20   within the heat exchanger?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
22             THE WITNESS:  I did calculations, yes.
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  I understand you did calculations.
25             Did you calculate the back pressure
0135
 1   present in the heat exchanger?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 3             THE WITNESS:  I did not actually calculate
 4   numerical values for back pressure.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Okay.
 7         A.  However, I do know the back pressure is
 8   initially 1.0 to 1.4 inches of water, because that's
 9   what your pressure switch requires in order to
10   actually make us close the circuit and start the
11   rest of the system to operate.
12         Q.  And it's your understanding that this
13   small motor, or not very big motor, whatever it is,
14   an eighth of horsepower, was enough to clear that
15   back pressure and permit the combustion to go
16   forward?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
18   ambiguous.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  That is what you testified, isn't it, sir?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
22   ambiguous, compound, incomplete hypothetical.
23             THE WITNESS:  What I testified to is that
24   the blower motor is -- one of its functions is to
25   run for 30 seconds and push air through the heat
0136
 1   exchanger and get fresh air in the heat exchanger as
 2   opposed to whatever combustion products could be
 3   left.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  All right.  Once you have ignition, do you
 6   know if the overfire pressure is positive or
 7   negative from the combustion chamber?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
 9   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
10             THE WITNESS:  You used a term called
11   "overfire pressure"?
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  Yeah.  Do you know what the overfire is?
14         A.  I'm not sure I know what you're referring
15   to.
16         Q.  Okay.  All right.  So the next invoice is
17   from July, and that looks like it includes some
18   additional depositions that you read, some
19   information and discussions with Mr. Jarchi, and
20   then the site inspection visit.
21             And I assume that's the one in Irwindale
22   with Dr. Romig?
23         A.  That's it.
24         Q.  All right.  That was a full-day inspection
25   on June 28th, it looks like?
0137
 1         A.  Yeah.  It took me a full day to get up
 2   there, inspect and get back, yes.
 3         Q.  Okay.  So a couple days before that, there
 4   was a two-and-a-half-hour charge for read depos,
 5   prep for site inspection and call from Mr. Jarchi.
 6             Was there a discussion with Mr. Jarchi
 7   that -- where you were talking about the inspection
 8   and what was going to be accomplished?
 9         A.  Oh.  Yeah, I -- most of that day was --
10   best of my recollection, was reading the
11   depositions.  And I also prepared -- I pulled
12   together my instruments, my cameras, whatever I was
13   going to take with me up there, and tried to think
14   through what I wanted to measure.  So some of that
15   is getting ready for going up for an inspection.
16         Q.  All right.  What instruments did you take,
17   other than your camera?
18         A.  Well, let's see.  What did I take, other
19   than my camera.  I took a tape measure so I could
20   photograph things and get dimensions.  I took a
21   magnet because I wanted to make sure that I could
22   test to see what was stainless steel and what was
23   carbon steel.
24             Let's see.  What else did I take with me.
25   I'll tell you one thing.  I always take with me
0138
 1   about ten times as much stuff as I really need.  But
 2   those were the things I used, best of my
 3   recollection.
 4         Q.  All right.  Did you have any combustion
 5   analyzers that you took with you?
 6         A.  I don't have a combustion analyzer and I
 7   didn't rent one.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Did you verify that the heat
 9   exchanger components on the exemplar that you looked
10   at on June 28th were of the same material as the
11   subject heat exchanger in terms of what was carbon,
12   what was carbon steel and what was stainless steel?
13         A.  If I recollect, no, but I can't really --
14   I don't remember if tubes were stainless steel or
15   carbon steel, the ones that would have failed.  I'd
16   have to look at my -- my pictures and see.  So...
17         Q.  So what were you --
18             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, calls
19   for speculation.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Why did you bring magnets?  What were you
22   hoping to test?
23         A.  Oh.  The reason I brought a magnet is
24   because that's one of the things that we always do
25   in this business, bring a magnet.  You want to know
0139
 1   if -- if it's thorough magnetic, it's a -- it's not
 2   stainless steel; it's a carbon steel.
 3         Q.  Sure.
 4         A.  So I just use a magnet to go around
 5   testing pieces.  You can't tell by looking,
 6   especially after they've been used, because they're
 7   discolored.  Sometimes they appear to be even rusty.
 8   So I use the magnet to determine which parts were
 9   stainless and which parts were carbon steel.
10         Q.  Okay.  Was that just a general curiosity,
11   or were you trying to determine and confirm that the
12   heat exchanger on the exemplar oven was manufactured
13   with the same materials as the heat exchanger on the
14   subject oven?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, assumes
16   facts, misstates the evidence.
17             THE WITNESS:  I'm trying to think.  It
18   seems to me like we never knew we had access to the
19   heat exchanger of the exemplar we tested.
20             There was another heat exchanger sitting
21   in the area, and I tested -- I looked at that one,
22   but in order to actually see the heat exchanger in
23   this exemplar, you have to take it apart, and I
24   don't recall us doing that.
25   ///
0140
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  So did you -- what other materials
 3   were you checking to see if it was carbon steel
 4   versus stainless steel on the exemplar oven as far
 5   as the heat exchanger?
 6         A.  Well, I didn't care what the other
 7   materials were.  The heat exchanger was all I was
 8   concerned about.
 9         Q.  Okay.  But you didn't have access to that?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, calls
11   for speculation.
12             THE WITNESS:  Again, I remember testing
13   it, but I believe it was another heat exchanger that
14   was not in that particular exemplar.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  Did you do any testing or analysis
17   of the heat exchanger that you did do the magnet
18   test on, other than just using the magnet?
19         A.  No.
20         Q.  And at this point, you don't recall
21   whether that heat exchanger that was not related to
22   the exemplar testing, whether it had stainless steel
23   lower tubes or carbon steel tubes?
24         A.  I can't recall it just as I sit here
25   today.
0141
 1         Q.  Okay.  All right.  Now, it looks like a
 2   little over a week after that inspection, you had a
 3   teleconference that was -- no.  On July 2nd you had
 4   a seven-hour conference call and on July 9th you had
 5   a six-and-a-half hour conference call.
 6             First, the July 2nd call.  So this would
 7   have been four days after your exemplar testing.
 8             Do you remember who that conference call
 9   involved?
10         A.  We're looking at the July invoice.  That's
11   right?
12         Q.  It's the August invoice with July charges.
13         A.  Right.
14         Q.  Yeah.
15         A.  Yeah.  We -- we had a call with Rob and
16   some of the experts.  I can't remember who all was
17   on the call.
18         Q.  Was it the experts that had been at the
19   inspection to discuss the results of the inspection?
20         A.  Yeah, some of them were.
21         Q.  So was Dr. Romig involved in that
22   conference call?
23         A.  Best of my recollection, he was.  Guthrie.
24         Q.  Ms. Gill?
25         A.  I think she was on the call.
0142
 1         Q.  All right.  Was Mr. Hendrickson on the
 2   call?
 3         A.  I don't believe so.
 4         Q.  Did Mr. Hendrickson attend the exemplar
 5   testing?
 6         A.  No.
 7         Q.  What was the subject of that lengthy call?
 8         A.  Well, Rob wanted to go over a lot of the
 9   documents that he was -- that we would be asked to
10   review.
11         Q.  Okay.
12         A.  And it just takes a while.  As you know,
13   there's just a plethora of material in this case,
14   and so we went through some of those documents and
15   how they related to our testing.
16         Q.  So were you directed by Mr. Jarchi to go
17   look at specific documents that had already been
18   provided to you, or were these new documents that
19   were going to be provided to you?
20         A.  No, these were documents that I had.
21         Q.  Okay.  So you were just sort of directed
22   to things that might affect your opinions?
23         A.  "You need to look at such and such.  You
24   need to look at such and such.  You need to look at
25   this, that, and the other."
0143
 1         Q.  Okay.  Do you remember if Dr. Galatsis was
 2   on that long call on July 2nd?
 3         A.  Boy, I don't remember.
 4         Q.  All right.
 5         A.  He could have been.  I've never met him,
 6   and so I -- I've had no interaction with him, so...
 7         Q.  All right.  Now, a week and a half
 8   later -- I'm sorry, just a week later, there's
 9   another 6.5 hour charge for a teleconference and
10   prep.
11             Do you remember what that teleconference
12   was about and who was on it?
13         A.  About the same -- it was about the same
14   thing, going over the documents in the case.  And
15   each of us had areas that we were concerned
16   primarily with, so -- but we were trying to get an
17   understanding of the overall big picture.
18         Q.  Okay.  So it was a continuation where you
19   were talking with the experts, Mr. Jarchi's advising
20   of different materials each of you should then take
21   a look at consistent with the work you've done on
22   the case?
23         A.  Right.  My stress analysis stuff obviously
24   relates to Joe Romig's understanding of the
25   combustion part of the thing and so on and so forth.
0144
 1   So we just kicked around mostly technical issues.
 2         Q.  All right.
 3         A.  We were, in effect, reverse engineering
 4   this heat exchanger to try to understand how it
 5   worked and why it didn't work and when it failed and
 6   why.
 7         Q.  All right.  And then you have the
 8   following week a call and work on a Swagelok
 9   followed by the next day two hours of research on a
10   Swagelok.
11             What -- what was that call and research
12   focused on?
13         A.  Yeah, let me see.  What dates?
14         Q.  Yeah, it's July 15 and July 16 of 2019.
15         A.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  One of the things that I
16   got to thinking about is the -- how long had the
17   Swagelok concept been around, and so I decided I
18   would do some research into that area, and I went
19   back and read the patent -- first time I had seen
20   that Swagelok was the patent, but I can't remember
21   the guy's name that patented it, but I'll think of
22   it in a minute -- and he shows that Swagelok very
23   clearly in his patent application, which was like
24   early '90s or late '80s.
25         Q.  Okay.
0145
 1         A.  And so one of the things I learned
 2   about -- and I read that patent pretty thoroughly
 3   and I noticed that every claim that he had in the
 4   patent was related to the Swagelok concept, and so
 5   then after I read that patent and understood what he
 6   was trying to do there, I went back to say, "Well,
 7   how long has that technique been around."
 8         Q.  Okay.
 9         A.  And so I went and actually looked at the
10   Swagelok.  It was confusing at first, because
11   there's another technique called a SwedgeLock
12   instead of a Swagelok, and they're completely
13   different concepts, but they sound like they ought
14   to be the same thing.
15         Q.  Right.
16         A.  And I wanted to see where the origin of
17   this was.  It turns out that they had been using
18   something similar to this for connecting thin wall
19   tubes together, hoses and radiators.
20             Go back to the Model A Ford, you'll see
21   that they have a little device that raises a little
22   bump in the tube so that when you put the rubber
23   hose on there and clamp it down, it doesn't come
24   off.  So that goes back a hundred years.
25             The Swagelok design is basically taking
0146
 1   that the next step and putting that tube through
 2   another plate and then rolling it out so that it
 3   stays connected.
 4         Q.  Right.
 5         A.  I just wanted to try to understand -- they
 6   make such a big deal about the Swagelok and how it's
 7   weld was designed and all that stuff.  I wanted to
 8   understand its origin.  Probably a bad habit for an
 9   engineer.  I don't know.
10         Q.  Not necessarily.
11             Other than the patent, did you try and go
12   back and look and see whether Swageloks or the
13   Swagelok design was utilized in any other commercial
14   products that were available in the late '80s, early
15   '90s?
16         A.  Yeah, I looked -- I noticed when
17   Mr. Mills, Dr. Mills, whenever he was trying to
18   design a new oven, he utilized the serpentine --
19   bent serpentine tubes and a Swagelok, and he was
20   actually able to buy that from a friend that made
21   those, and they seemed like they had been in the
22   business for a while making that.
23         Q.  The supplier of those kind of tubes and
24   locks had been in the business, in your mind, for
25   some time?
0147
 1         A.  Sure.
 2         Q.  Do you know on what applications those had
 3   been used?
 4         A.  They were heat exchangers.
 5         Q.  Okay.  So they were used in heat
 6   exchangers?
 7         A.  Yes, they were.  I can get it in my notes,
 8   but it actually shows in Mills.  He had a report
 9   that he did for progress on the new heat exchanger
10   design.  He actually shows that serpentine tube with
11   the Swagelok design which he purchased from a
12   company that makes those.
13         Q.  Do you know whether any commercial bakery
14   oven manufacturer was offering a product that used a
15   Swagelok as opposed to welded heat exchangers prior
16   to the new offering from Hobart in the late '90s?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
18             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't know of any,
19   no.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Are you aware of any boiler manufacturers
22   that were using Swagelok technology for their heat
23   exchangers prior to the late '90s?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
25             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't believe the
0148
 1   Swagelok design is applicable to boilers.
 2   BY MR. CROSS:
 3         Q.  Okay.  There are heat exchangers used on
 4   some boilers?
 5         A.  Well, a boiler by its definition has
 6   internal pressure, and if you were to use a Swagelok
 7   design, you cannot guarantee leakproof under high
 8   pressure.  So I don't think you could use that
 9   design for a boiler.
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  Okay.  So it's only appropriate, in your
12   mind, for potential use on a commercial bakery oven
13   because you don't have high pressures involved in
14   the heat exchanger?
15         A.  It's not --
16             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
17             THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  It's not just a
18   bakery oven.  Any application that would -- and it
19   would generally be an air-to-air or a gas-to-gas
20   heat exchanger --
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Right.
23         A.  -- because if you're using water or oil or
24   something like that, you would be pressurizing it.
25   And it is not a leakproof positive design.
0149
 1         Q.  So the Swagelok is going to be appropriate
 2   for heat exchangers where you're -- you're not going
 3   to have high pressure environments such as the
 4   commercial bakery oven?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates --
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  That would be an appropriate use of the
 8   Swagelok?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.
10             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  Anytime you have
11   relatively low pressures and you don't have to have
12   100 percent leakproof, then I think it would be an
13   application.  But it could be in heaters, other
14   kinds of heaters, heat exchanger equipment.
15   Recuperators, for example, that sort of thing.
16             If you don't mind, I'd like to take a bio
17   break here.
18             MR. CROSS:  Yeah, can I get -- we've got
19   one invoice left.  If I can just ask you this and
20   we'll be done with that section and we'll take a
21   break maybe for lunch.
22             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, no problem.
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  Your last invoice from September
25   reflecting time spent in August, you've got from
0150
 1   August 6 through August 9th, 17 hours for something
 2   called My Opinions.
 3         A.  Yep, that's what I'm -- and this is what
 4   I'm working on.
 5         Q.  Okay.  So Exhibit 6 is what you're calling
 6   My Opinions, and that reflects the work you did over
 7   that time frame?
 8         A.  Correct.
 9         Q.  All right.  Then it looks like you talked
10   to Dr. Romig at Ponderosa for an hour and a half on
11   August 23rd?
12         A.  That's what it says here.
13         Q.  Do you recall what that conversation was
14   about?
15         A.  Yes.  I was -- I was discussing with him
16   the combustion process, and I had done some
17   calculations, which I think you have a copy of.
18         Q.  Uh-huh.
19         A.  And I was describing my calculations to
20   him, and I wanted to get his input, if they were --
21   he thought that was a valid approach.
22         Q.  Okay.  The calculations I have about
23   combustion pressures are dated I think after this
24   August 23rd call.
25             Did you talk with Dr. Romig before doing
0151
 1   the calculations, or you had done calculations and
 2   you were reviewing with him?
 3         A.  I had done some premier calculations,
 4   either like back-of-the-envelope calculations to get
 5   some basic ideas of where I wanted to go with it.
 6             Then I called him up and I said, "Here's
 7   what I'm doing, Joe."
 8         Q.  Yeah.
 9         A.  "And I'm assuming this, I'm assuming that,
10   and I'm trying to back out from that pressure" --
11   expected pressures inside the heat exchanger when
12   the combustion is working when you're burning it."
13   And that's what we talked about.
14         Q.  Do you still have those back-of-the-
15   envelope initial calculations or just the ones from
16   later after that call?
17         A.  Just the ones -- everything that I -- I
18   mean they were so awful, I just threw them in the
19   trash.  But I tried to copy them over into a legible
20   format, but they're the same calculations.
21         Q.  All right.  And then four days after that,
22   you have a call, and it says an hour and a half.
23   Read Galatsis & call.
24             Do you recall -- so I assume that's
25   reading Dr. Galatsis's deposition?
0152
 1         A.  Correct.
 2         Q.  And do you remember who you had a call
 3   with?  Was it Dr. Galatsis, Mr. Jarchi or both?
 4         A.  I think it was Rob Jarchi.  I don't
 5   remember calling Galatsis.
 6         Q.  Were you called or did you call
 7   Mr. Jarchi?
 8         A.  I think I called Rob.
 9         Q.  All right.  And did you raise some sort of
10   concern from the deposition you had read of
11   Dr. Galatsis?
12         A.  No.  I just wanted to make sure I
13   understood -- one of the areas that he's working on,
14   or the area that he's primarily working in is the
15   measurement of carbon monoxide and other combustion
16   gases and their effects on the health.  So I wanted
17   to try to understand that.  So I read his deposition
18   to try to understand the difference between the
19   various measurements and how they worked and what
20   they meant.
21         Q.  Okay.
22         A.  And obviously, I cannot become an expert
23   in an hour and a half --
24         Q.  Sure.
25         A.  But I didn't want to come in here
0153
 1   completely not understanding what they tried to do
 2   there.
 3         Q.  Okay.  And then the last entry I want to
 4   ask you about is, it says August 29 you did
 5   calculate pressure.
 6             And that's the handwritten calculations
 7   that were presented as part of your file?
 8         A.  Yeah, those were my file versions, and I
 9   tried to copy them over so that you could read them.
10             MR. CROSS:  Okay.  Well, with that, I
11   don't want to keep you here while we need to take a
12   quick break, but why don't we work in a lunch break
13   at the same time.  So it is 12:45 now.  We'll shoot

 9                   EXAMINATION (Resumed)
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  All right, sir.  We've had a quick break
12   for lunch.  I want to just finish up some final
13   questions getting through your file, and then we'll
14   move on into another area and talk a little bit
15   about the scope of your opinions, okay?
16         A.  Okay.
17             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 7 was
18             marked for identification by the
19             deposition reporter and is attached
20             hereto.)
21   BY MR. CROSS
22         Q.  First I want to ask hand you what I've
23   marked as Exhibit 7 and ask if you can identify this
24   document for me.
25         A.  Yeah, this document is -- are calculations
0155
 1   I made with regard to the heat -- the airflow
 2   through the heat exchanger.
 3         Q.  Okay.  And these are some of the
 4   calculations you made in the last couple of weeks
 5   after reviewing the depositions of Dr. Romig and
 6   Dr. Galatsis?
 7         A.  Dr. Romig in particular.
 8             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 8 was
 9             marked for identification by the
10             deposition reporter and is attached
11             hereto.)
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  And then I also want to hand you what
14   we've marked as Exhibit 8 and ask you if you can
15   identify that for me.
16         A.  Yes, sir.  That's a one-page calculation
17   that I made for looking at the hood.
18         Q.  Okay.  Have there been any other
19   calculations you've made in terms of analyzing the
20   hood or its ventilation effectiveness?
21         A.  No, sir.
22         Q.  Okay.  Other than what we've marked as
23   Exhibit 5, 5B, 5C, 6, 7 and 8, is there any test
24   data or notes that you have generated as personal
25   work product in this case?
0156
 1         A.  No, sir, I don't think so.
 2         Q.  Then you also produced to us photographs
 3   both from your inspection of the subject heat
 4   exchanger as well as photographs taken at the
 5   exemplar inspection and testing you did with
 6   Dr. Romig back in late June of this year; correct?
 7         A.  Correct.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Were there any other photographs
 9   that you generated in connection with this case,
10   other than from those two inspections?
11         A.  No.
12         Q.  You talked about earlier today reviewing
13   Dr. Romig's charts and some graphs, and that's one
14   of the reasons you had a follow-up call with him and
15   his assistant.
16             Were you provided copies of the actual
17   charts and graphs, or were you -- were they just
18   described to you?
19         A.  I cannot remember for sure.  I did see the
20   charts somehow.
21         Q.  Okay.  Do you recall how that might
22   have -- just because it wasn't included as part of
23   your production file, I'm just trying to find out
24   how you saw them.
25         A.  Yeah, I don't recall.  I just -- I'm
0157
 1   sorry.  I --
 2         Q.  That's fine.
 3         A.  -- I don't remember.  We had a conference
 4   call with Joe and Mr. Guthrie, and we talked about
 5   what -- what they learned, because after we had the
 6   inspection, I was curious to know how the -- how the
 7   testing came out.  But I don't remember seeing -- I
 8   don't remember having the charts, no.
 9         Q.  Okay.  Were you present during all of the
10   testing that was done that day in late June?
11         A.  I was.
12         Q.  Okay.  I know you said a couple different
13   things here.  In the last few minutes here, I think
14   you said that you believe you saw the charts and
15   then I thought right there at the end you told me
16   you don't know if you've seen the charts or not.
17             Do you know which it is?
18         A.  I'm pretty sure I've seen the charts.  I
19   just don't know where I saw them.
20         Q.  Have you had any in-person meetings with
21   Dr. Romig?
22         A.  Just at the testing.  That's the only time
23   I've -- and I did call in later regarding this, my
24   calculations that you got marked Exhibit 7.
25         Q.  Well, and I know -- I know we reviewed
0158
 1   that there weren't any transmittal communications
 2   from any of the other experts.
 3             Do you believe that any of the conference
 4   calls you have listed were like video conference or
 5   WebEx or something like that where you could share
 6   work product with one another?
 7         A.  I think the conference when I was down
 8   here with Rob, I'm pretty sure he had some kind of a
 9   video conferencing.
10         Q.  So were you present live with Mr. Jarchi
11   here in these offices and then other people were
12   attending remotely, or --
13         A.  I don't remember.  I do remember seeing
14   the video -- I mean the animation stills.  That's
15   about all I remember.
16         Q.  Okay.
17         A.  I don't remember exactly how we
18   communicated, but it could have been one of those
19   things where you can see somebody else's computer
20   from yours.  Maybe that's how I saw the charts.
21         Q.  Now, what are you referring to as
22   animation stills?
23         A.  Well, the picture that I showed you in my
24   report.
25         Q.  Uh-huh.
0159
 1         A.  That's what I'm --
 2         Q.  Figure 2?
 3         A.  Yeah.
 4         Q.  Okay.  And that was a PowerPoint you
 5   created and sent to the mystery animators; right?
 6         A.  Right.
 7         Q.  Okay.  Were there still shots from any of
 8   the three animations that you've reviewed at some
 9   point in time?
10         A.  Only from the animations themselves
11   whenever I got those.
12         Q.  So you have seen the three animations?
13         A.  I have.
14         Q.  Okay.  Have you seen more than three?
15         A.  No, I only saw the three.
16         Q.  All right.  Do you remember when you were
17   first provided copies of the animations?
18         A.  Oh, let's see.  I don't.  It was within
19   the last few weeks because I don't think they were
20   finished more than like a month ago at the most.
21         Q.  And other than providing that initial two
22   PowerPoints to Mr. Jarchi to pass along to the
23   mystery animators, have you ever spoken with them
24   about the animations?
25         A.  With the animators?
0160
 1         Q.  With the animators.
 2         A.  Yeah, when I was here when they were on
 3   the phone.
 4         Q.  Okay.  When were you here when -- because
 5   you said you just saw the animations --
 6         A.  No, that was whenever they were first
 7   starting on them.
 8         Q.  Okay.  When was that?
 9         A.  I don't know.  It's in my -- we went
10   through that on the time, on my time sheets.
11         Q.  Was that one of those entries that
12   happened in the last four to six months?
13         A.  Yeah.
14         Q.  Okay.  So that was one of the calls that
15   actually took place with you here in Mr. Jarchi's
16   office talking with --
17         A.  I was down here talking with Rob, sure.
18         Q.  Okay.  How long did you talk with the
19   animators?
20         A.  Probably 15 or 20 minutes.
21         Q.  Okay.  What was the subject of the
22   conversation?
23         A.  Well, I tried to explain to them what I
24   wanted to show, and I wanted to -- they did have
25   that picture where it showed the air going through
0161
 1   the heat exchanger and starting out hot and getting
 2   cooler as it comes out and then the exhaust, and
 3   then the blue arrow that you referred to that would
 4   be the cross flow, that would be from the oven
 5   itself, and then I explained to them that I wanted
 6   to show a couple of things.
 7             We wanted to show the flow through the
 8   heat exchanger and then the convection fan and then
 9   how the air would go into the baking area of the
10   oven.
11             We talked about showing the leakage out of
12   the door and basically just having some arrows --
13   some smoke coming out around the door.
14             I also wanted them to put in the part
15   where if you have combustion products coming out
16   near the bottom of the door, there would be a great
17   chance that you would pull those in to the inlet
18   air, to the combustion fan.
19             And those were the things that I wanted to
20   be able to illustrate, and I wanted to show a before
21   and after of the breach of the heat exchanger.
22         Q.  Okay.
23         A.  So it took quite a while on a phone call
24   to explain all of that stuff.
25         Q.  So I understand what you're telling them
0162
 1   you want to see in the animation.
 2             Did you provide them any objective data of
 3   any type whatsoever?
 4         A.  Objective data.
 5         Q.  Yeah, like flow rate measurements or
 6   calculations or any sort of scientific inputs to
 7   use?
 8         A.  No.  My goal with the animation was to
 9   illustrate my opinions but not try to do it
10   quantitatively.  It was more of a qualitative
11   illustration of my opinions of what went on.
12         Q.  So in terms of your work with the
13   animators, were -- is there any empirical data
14   whatsoever that you provided, or is it all
15   qualitative and specifically limited to that
16   photograph of how the gases flow through the heat
17   exchanger?
18             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
19             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it's qualitative in
20   the respect that I was just trying to describe the
21   basic idea.
22             It's quantitative in respect to the fact
23   that we have -- I was trying to illustrate the
24   temperature drop as you go through various stages of
25   the heat exchanger.  I --
0163
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  Is it reflective of --
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Just for the record, he
 4   didn't finish his answer.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Go ahead and finish your answer.
 7         A.  Okay.  It's qualitative but not
 8   quantitative; qualitative in terms of the fact that
 9   you do get a temperature decrease as you pass
10   through the various portions of the heat exchanger,
11   and the -- and the -- I tried to illustrate whenever
12   the tubes are breached at the lower end of the heat
13   exchanger how then you would get carbon monoxide
14   flowing into the -- into the bake chamber.  But I
15   did not try to put a number on it.  I wasn't able to
16   calculate the amount of gas.
17         Q.  Well, I think you anticipated my question
18   that I started to interrupt your answer with.
19             So these weren't measured or calculated
20   data; these are, "I want you to show me what I would
21   like to explain."
22         A.  That's right.  My goal, as I said, was to
23   be able to demonstrate what I think happened once
24   these holes came in the tubes and we started seeing
25   combustion products being leaked out into the baking
0164
 1   chamber.
 2         Q.  Okay.  Now, have you -- have you taken any
 3   measurements or done any calculations whatsoever
 4   about the mass flow rate or the other flow
 5   characteristics of the convection flow path drawing
 6   air from the heat exchanger and into the bake
 7   chamber so that, separate and apart from the
 8   animations, you have any quantitative understanding
 9   of that process?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
11             THE WITNESS:  You're referring to the
12   convection process of the baking chamber being
13   circulated across the heat exchanger to pick up heat
14   and then back into the baking chamber through the
15   ventilator -- the side walls.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  Right.  Do you have any objective data
18   that was measured or any calculations you've done
19   similar to what you showed with the vent hood
20   reflecting that flow path and how much and exactly
21   what components of flue gas mixture would be
22   circulating and entering the bake chamber?
23             MR. JARCHI:  Vague --
24             THE WITNESS:  I didn't make any
25   calculations.
0165
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  And you didn't take any measurements;
 3   correct?
 4             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 5             THE WITNESS:  Correct.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  All right.  Have you obtained any
 8   objective measurements or performed any calculations
 9   designed to trying to quantify what you claim to be
10   gas escaping the closed oven door?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
12   incomplete hypothetical.
13             THE WITNESS:  No.  What I tried to
14   represent in the animation was -- reflects the
15   testimony of the people who had seen steam coming
16   out of the door.  Ms. Lee.  I believe Mr. Gumbert
17   talked about that in one of his depositions.
18             Let me see if I can get my flow chart
19   here.  Oh, here we go.  Make sure I know who all the
20   players are today.
21             And then of course Nigel Mills talked
22   about having experienced seeing steam coming out of
23   the door at various times.  So the animation just
24   reflects what I understood was happening by these
25   depositions.
0166
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  You understood what was happening
 3   when steam's injected for that approximately 15- to
 4   20-second cycle?
 5         A.  That's part of it.
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague.
 7   BY MR. CROSS:
 8         Q.  Okay.  From your reading of Mr. Mill -- or
 9   Dr. Mills, do you have an understanding of the
10   pressure consequences of the steam process and the
11   duration of that process with regard to this oven?
12         A.  I do have a certain amount of understanding
13   of Mills.  He indicated that when you -- when you
14   spray water onto these heated balls that they have
15   in the oven that it generates a fairly large amount
16   of volume of steam, and then that steam will tend to
17   cause overpressure in the baking chamber.
18             Not all that steam can go up the vent.
19   They have a vent for that to keep from
20   overpressuring the bake chamber, and then they lose
21   some steam out the door, and which is probably the
22   reason that they added better seals and some latches
23   at the -- as a change order to the ovens.
24         Q.  Okay.  And did you have an understanding
25   that the addition of steam is something that happens
0167
 1   for less than 30 seconds on any given bake cycle?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, vague and
 3   ambiguous.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  You didn't read the man's testimony, did
 6   you not?
 7         A.  I did, yes.  And I understand it's a very
 8   short period of time.  You're just trying to
 9   introduce moisture into the baking chamber.
10         Q.  Do you have any belief that there is a
11   greater than roughly one atmosphere of pressure
12   inside the bake chamber at any point other than this
13   short period of time when that large amount of steam
14   is introduced?
15         A.  I think there would be, yes.
16         Q.  Okay.  Have you done any calculations or
17   measurements to support that belief?
18         A.  Yeah, I --
19             MR. JARCHI:  Object --
20             THE WITNESS:  -- made a set of
21   calculations.  There's one that's dated 8-31.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  Okay.  And you're reflecting -- or you're
24   referencing the document we've marked as Exhibit 7?
25         A.  Correct.
0168
 1         Q.  Okay.  Can you point me to the page where
 2   you're talking about the increase of pressure within
 3   the bake chamber?
 4         A.  Sure.  Well, I just kind of have to go
 5   through the document here.
 6         Q.  Sure.
 7         A.  So the -- in -- and one of the things
 8   that's made me start thinking about this is in Joe's
 9   deposition, Romig's deposition.  One of the
10   questions that was asked to him was, you know, what
11   makes you think that the -- the combustion products
12   are going to be forced into the baking area chamber,
13   and what's going to -- and why wouldn't they just go
14   up the stack, basically.
15             And so I began to think about that, and I
16   realized that -- that there is a basic physics
17   mechanism to cause that, and I wanted to explore
18   that by a set of calculations which I've prepared
19   here.
20         Q.  Okay.  And so the calculations you
21   prepared is addressing the idea that combustion flue
22   gas would escape the heat exchanger and enter the
23   bake chamber; is that correct?
24         A.  Correct.  And there would be an
25   overpressure around the area where the tubes have
0169
 1   been breached --
 2         Q.  Okay.
 3         A.  -- that would tend to drive these
 4   combustion gases into the bake chamber.
 5         Q.  Okay.  So the combustion gases are going
 6   to leave the breach of the heat exchanger and some
 7   of them will enter the bake chamber.
 8         A.  Yes.
 9         Q.  What analysis, volumetric analysis or
10   pressure analysis, have you done of the back chamber
11   itself to determine what its pressure is at any
12   given condition?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered, vague and
14   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
15             THE WITNESS:  Well, the bake chamber
16   itself, when you have a breached heat exchanger like
17   this, and the combustion -- the heater is running,
18   okay, you will start to pump gas into the baking
19   chamber.  As you do that, you will start replacing
20   the air inside the baking chamber, and you will
21   develop a small overpressure, because the pressure
22   of the gas coming into the baking chamber is higher
23   than the ambient conditions, which essentially are
24   the case in the baking chamber, typically, normally.
25   ///
0170
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  Have you measured or calculated
 3   this small overpressure that you've just explained?
 4         A.  I haven't, because -- but I just haven't.
 5         Q.  Okay.  Have you determined whether this
 6   small overpressure that you believe happens as
 7   you're pumping combustion gases into the bake
 8   chamber, at what point, if any, they're able to
 9   overwhelm the door seals and escape similar to what
10   we see with the steam?
11         A.  Well, first of all, I don't believe --
12             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, assumes
13   facts, incomplete hypothetical.
14             Go ahead.
15             THE WITNESS:  I don't believe it has to
16   overwhelm the door seals.  I don't think the door
17   seals are tight enough to restrict some airflow out
18   of the bake chamber.
19             There's -- it's a big door.  Been my
20   experience that when you try to seal a door that
21   large, especially with temperature gradients, you'll
22   have some leakage.  You won't have a complete seal.
23   And so you can actually start to see combustion
24   products leak out of the door at these leaking areas
25   where they're not sealed properly without having a
0171
 1   great deal of increased internal pressure.  A few
 2   inches of water will do it.

 4         Q.  So since this is such an easy process to
 5   replicate, have you seen anybody that's taken
 6   objective data and measured carbon monoxide existing
 7   outside the door of the oven while it's in
 8   operation?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
10   ambiguous --
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  Any of them --
13             MR. JARCHI:  -- argumentative.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  -- either the subjective oven or the
16   exemplar oven, has anybody tested and measured and
17   found carbon monoxide outside the oven door with the
18   oven door shut?
19             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
20   vague and ambiguous, compound, incomplete hypothetical.
21             THE WITNESS:  I haven't seen it.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  Okay.  So this is something you suspect
24   might happen, but it's not something that you have
25   objective data or calculated data to support that
0172
 1   opinion; correct?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the prior
 3   testimony regarding a whole host of things,
 4   including the testimony of witnesses and documents.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  I'm asking the work you did, sir.
 7             Do you have any objective data or
 8   calculations to back up your opinion that carbon
 9   monoxide is going to escape the door?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.
11             THE WITNESS:  Well, in my opinion, as
12   doing these kinds of calculations for many years, if
13   you don't have a complete seal and you have even a
14   small amount of overpressure, which I believe you
15   will get by -- in a heat exchanger while the
16   combustor is running, you will see leakage out of
17   the seals.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  Okay.  So you're basing it on experience
20   now that you've done with, quote, "these types of
21   analyses."
22             What specific types of analyses are you
23   relying upon now?
24         A.  Well, first of all, it's just common
25   sense.  If I were to fill the bake chamber up with
0173
 1   three inches of water, it would leak like a sieve.
 2         Q.  Okay.
 3         A.  And if water will leak out of it so that
 4   you can see it, you would certainly leak air out of
 5   it and gas, because it will go out through a much
 6   smaller hole.
 7             So unless you -- unless your firm believes
 8   that this is a watertight or an airtight seal, you
 9   will get combustion gases coming out around the
10   seal.
11         Q.  Okay.  And what quantity of combustion
12   gases generally, or carbon monoxide specifically,
13   are going to escape that oven, in your opinion,
14   while it's in operation?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  With a breached exchange heater pumping
18   things in as you've attempted to calculate in your
19   notes.
20             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical and
21   vague and ambiguous.
22             THE WITNESS:  I haven't attempted to
23   quantify that.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  All right.  You mentioned a couple times
0174
 1   anything that's not waterproof --
 2         A.  Watertight.
 3         Q.  -- watertight, you would expect, with a
 4   slight overpressure, is going to leak something out.
 5             Did I catch earlier that the Swagelok that
 6   you've talked about and identified is not leakproof
 7   or is not watertight?
 8         A.  I said it wouldn't --
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
10             THE WITNESS:  Sorry.  I said it would leak
11   under pressure.
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  Okay.  So you would expect -- to the
14   extent there is pressure such as you've calculated
15   exists within the heat exchanger pipes, would you
16   expect there to be loss through the Swagelok similar
17   to a hairline crack and a welded joint --
18             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
19   incomplete hypothetical.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  -- since it's not watertight?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.
23             THE WITNESS:  I would say the leak through
24   a hairline crack is minimal.
25   ///
0175
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.  And so you would expect some sort
 3   of minimal leak out the Swagelok because it's not
 4   watertight, if a Swagelok were used in the heat
 5   exchanger design?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.
 7             THE WITNESS:  It depends upon -- all
 8   depends on the magnitude of the number.  If you're
 9   looking at a leak -- it comes back down to leak
10   rates.
11             If you have a good Swagelok design and you
12   have expanded the inner piece of tubing against the
13   outer piece of tubing and you have some residual
14   compression there, it will be pretty tight and
15   you'll get a very, very small amount of leakage
16   under pressure, similarly with a hairline crack.
17             But hairline cracks grow into big cracks,
18   and they end up growing completely where their tubes
19   are three-quarters of an inch missing.  So that's
20   a -- it's a different problem altogether.  It's not
21   the same.  You can't say A equals B.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  All right.  Now, you're talking about
24   leaks under pressure.
25             What about the characteristics of the
0176
 1   Swagelok as a function of temperature.
 2             Are the joining of those two materials
 3   going to change as a function of temperature?
 4         A.  It shouldn't --
 5             MR. JARCHI:  I'm sorry.  Objection; vague
 6   and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
 7             THE WITNESS:  They shouldn't change as it
 8   heats up, because if both pieces are made from the
 9   same metal, it should have the same coefficient of
10   thermal expansion, and they have the same radius at
11   the interface, so, therefore, they should grow in
12   the same ratio.  So whatever clearance you had to
13   begin with, you should have at the -- at
14   temperature.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  Have you done any work to determine
17   the feasibility on this application of using
18   Swageloks that would not permit, I guess, leakage
19   under pressure and temperature?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
21   incomplete hypothetical.
22             THE WITNESS:  I have not done any work on
23   it.  That was your question.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  Yeah.  Okay.
0177
 1             Now, you produced as part of your file a
 2   protective order that you signed earlier -- earlier
 3   this year to receive certain documents that were
 4   produced by ITW?
 5         A.  Correct.
 6         Q.  And it appears that a lot of ITW design
 7   materials were sent to you just this past June?
 8         A.  Best of my recollection, yeah.
 9         Q.  Okay.  Did you review the various
10   protective materials that were sent to you after you
11   signed the protective order?
12         A.  As far as I know, I did.  I reviewed
13   everything that was sent to me.
14         Q.  Okay.  Is there anything that you have
15   asked for in terms of documents that you have not
16   been provided by Mr. Jarchi?
17         A.  Not that I can recall.
18         Q.  Did any of the documents that were
19   provided to you this past June alter or affect the
20   opinions you've independently reached to that point
21   in any way?
22         A.  Well, without specific references, I don't
23   think I can answer that question in generality.
24             If you can, you know, give me an example
25   of something, I -- I don't know of anything, but --
0178
 1         Q.  Right.
 2         A.  -- there might be something here that I
 3   don't remember.
 4         Q.  Let me clean it up a little bit here.
 5         A.  Sure.
 6         Q.  To the extent anything you received after
 7   signing the protective order affected your opinions
 8   in any way, have you had a full and fair opportunity
 9   to incorporate those documents into your analysis?
10         A.  As far as I know, yeah.
11         Q.  Okay.  And as far as you know, as we sit
12   here today, you've had a full and fair opportunity
13   to consider all the various materials that were
14   produced to you by Mr. Jarchi's office in forming
15   your opinions?
16         A.  To the extent that I -- I know I -- I
17   would admit to you, sir, that there are so many
18   documents in this, I can't guarantee to you there's
19   not an obscure document somewhere hidden in this
20   that I haven't read and didn't take into consideration.
21             But to the best of my knowledge and
22   ability, I have looked at them all and tried to
23   consider their effect on my opinions.
24         Q.  Okay.  That's fair and understandable.
25             Sir, we talked about back in October of
0179
 1   2017 your inspection of the subject oven, and you've
 2   indicated to me that you've produced all your
 3   photographs and have not taken any notes at that
 4   inspection; correct?
 5         A.  Correct.
 6         Q.  Have you inspected the subject oven or any
 7   of its components at any other time other than
 8   October of 2017?
 9         A.  I think that's the only time I've seen it.
10         Q.  Okay.  Now, we talked about the exemplar
11   testing that you attended with Dr. Romig this past
12   June, and you indicated that primarily, Dr. Romig
13   and his associate --
14         A.  Mr. Guthrie.
15         Q.  -- Mr. Guthrie, I guess supervised or were
16   in charge of that testing; is that accurate?
17         A.  That's correct.
18         Q.  Okay.  Did you personally perform any
19   additional measurements of testing yourself?
20         A.  I didn't perform any other test.  I
21   suggested some additional tests while we were
22   there --
23         Q.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
24         A.  -- which we would agree on.
25         Q.  What additional testing did you suggest?
0180
 1         A.  Well, let's see.  We first started out, if
 2   I recall, testing it as it was presented to us
 3   without any modifications, and then we ran a couple
 4   of tests that way just to get the combustion
 5   products measured at the stack, out the output, and
 6   then we -- after a little -- a couple of tests,
 7   we -- I asked the question -- I think we all
 8   concurred that we should pull off the rubber line
 9   that goes to the pressure switches to see if that
10   would shut down the system.
11             We did that.  So we were basically running
12   the blower, and when you pull off the rubber lines
13   that go to the pressure switches, it senses -- it
14   thinks there's no fan rolling, so it does -- it
15   shuts down.  So we just started changing some
16   variables to make sure that it would operate as we
17   expected it to.
18             And then at some point we decided to
19   check and change the damper value, and we did that.
20   We changed the gas pressure coming in, if I recall
21   correctly.
22             So we ran through a whole series of
23   different tests, some of which I may have suggested,
24   but it was a collaborative effort.  And so -- but we
25   all had our opportunities to change as many things
0181
 1   and run as many tests as we had time and storage in
 2   the computer.
 3   BY MR. CROSS:
 4         Q.  Okay.  The first thing you said you did on
 5   that day was run it, run the oven without
 6   modifications.
 7             Can you describe for me the configuration
 8   of the oven?  Was this like in a bakery setting?
 9   Where were you when you were doing these tests
10   without modifications?
11         A.  Actually --
12             MR. JARCHI:  Misconstrues the testimony.
13             THE WITNESS:  Actually, I said we ran it
14   as presented to us.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  I thought you said without modifications.
17             But how was it presented to you?
18         A.  Well, you know, the -- I believe the air
19   damper was set on 6 and the gas was set at 3.7, and
20   this is from memory.  Hoses were hooked up.  I'm
21   trying to think if there was anything else that was
22   variable.
23             I think that was it.  It looked pretty
24   much like the manual initial setup for installation.
25         Q.  Okay.  Now, you said the gas is at 3.7.
0182
 1         A.  3.5.
 2         Q.  3.5.  Is the spec 2.8 on that?
 3         A.  It depends on the -- yeah, it depends on
 4   the amount of BTUs you're trying to get out of it.
 5   But, yeah, I think the installation manual says 2.8
 6   to get 318,000 BTUs out.
 7         Q.  Okay.  Do you know whether this oven was
 8   supposed to be running at 375,000 BTU?
 9         A.  I did not know that.
10             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
11   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  You also said the damper was set at 6.
14             Do you know what the spec for the air
15   damper is?
16             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
17   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, assumes facts.
18             THE WITNESS:  I'd have to look at the
19   installation instruction, but --
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Okay.  And is that the air damper for the
22   actual burner itself?
23         A.  For the burner, yes, sir.
24             Yeah, the initial startup, according to
25   the installation instructions, would be to set it at
0183
 1   5, and the DROG2H was 5.5.  So I could be wrong.  It
 2   could have been 5 or 5.5.  I just for some reason
 3   remembered 6.
 4         Q.  All right.  Now, you said this was some
 5   sort of shop that refurbishes bakery equipment.
 6             Was it set up as if it were in a
 7   commercial bakery, or was this -- where was the oven
 8   itself?
 9         A.  We were in a large steel building.  The
10   building was probably 40 feet high and we were in a
11   very large area, probably say 30 yards by 40 yards
12   floor area, and there was no -- the stack pipe was
13   not connected.  As a matter of fact, I don't think
14   any of the vents were connected to anything.
15             So we were basically running this oven,
16   sitting in a big warehouse without being connected
17   to an outside exhaust.
18         Q.  Okay.  So you're in this big steel
19   building with 40-foot-high ceilings, and if I
20   understand what you're saying right, the flue itself
21   was not connected to any external ventilation?
22         A.  That's correct.
23         Q.  And you're not aware of there being any
24   ventilation for any of the output vents on the top
25   of that oven?
0184
 1         A.  I don't believe there were any, sir.
 2         Q.  Okay.  During the testing you were
 3   conducting, did any of you have carbon monoxide
 4   monitors or respirators you were using while you
 5   were performing that testing?
 6         A.  No.  No, sir.
 7         Q.  Were any ambient measurements made of
 8   carbon monoxide in the area while you gentlemen and
 9   Ms. Gill were performing that testing?
10         A.  You'll have to ask Dr. Romig for that,
11   because I don't know.  I wasn't running the machine.
12         Q.  So I understand that there's not a flue
13   stack vent on the oven.
14             Did you have the draft inducer or the
15   stack fan that we talked about earlier set up
16   somehow, or was it also not in play on the exemplar
17   oven?
18         A.  It wasn't connected, best of my knowledge.
19         Q.  So you talked about changing the air
20   damper value on the burner and also changing the gas
21   pressure input.
22             Were there any other variables that you
23   changed during the course of the exemplar testing?
24         A.  Not that I know of.
25         Q.  Other than observing the absence of any
0185
 1   ventilation in connection with this oven, did you
 2   make any effort to assess or analyze whether or not
 3   the as-presented condition of the oven was as
 4   designed or not?
 5         A.  I didn't make any -- I didn't do any
 6   experimentation to determine anything like that, no.
 7         Q.  Okay.  Now, you said there was no
 8   ventilation pipes.
 9             Was there -- was there a hood or a
10   ventilation hood available on this oven at all?
11         A.  No, there was no ventilation hood.
12         Q.  Okay.  Now, the damper change you talked
13   about, that's just a -- that's a control that's
14   present and available on the burner itself; right?
15         A.  Correct.
16         Q.  Okay.  And you set that air damper where
17   you want on the burner?
18         A.  Yeah.  There's a picture of that on
19   Page 15 of the installation instructions.  That
20   would be ITW505.
21         Q.  Okay.  So how did you go about changing
22   the gas pressure input as a variable?
23         A.  The technician that was given to us to run
24   that oven, he had a wrench and he opened up, changed
25   the gas pressure.  He had a device that he hooked up
0186
 1   to it to measure the gas pressure coming out of the
 2   regulator.  So he reset that for us.
 3         Q.  Okay.  So he would just change the gas
 4   pressure and then had something that was measuring
 5   the pressure leaving the regulator or entering the
 6   regulator, which -- I guess it would be leaving the
 7   regulator if you're changing it.
 8         A.  Correct.
 9         Q.  Did anybody record or keep track of the
10   gas pressure measurements that were used as
11   different variables?
12         A.  Joe, I think, and Mr. Guthrie.
13         Q.  Okay.
14         A.  They took copious notes about the
15   operation and the testing.
16         Q.  Have you ever gone back for any reason and
17   looked at that exemplar oven after meeting Dr. Romig
18   out there in late June of 2019?
19         A.  No, I have not.
20         Q.  Did any of the testing data obtained in
21   June of 2019 factor into any of the calculations or
22   work product that you've presented?
23             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  Did you incorporate any of the exemplar
0187
 1   testing into your work product, sir?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 3             THE WITNESS:  Into my work product?  I
 4   don't think I've incorporated that, because I didn't
 5   write a report or I didn't -- I didn't record that
 6   in my reports, no.
 7   BY MR. CROSS:
 8         Q.  All right.  And is there anything from
 9   within -- I'm sorry.
10             Was there any of the exemplar testing data
11   obtained that appears within the calculations that
12   you have marked -- or that we have marked as
13   Exhibit 7 or Exhibit 8?
14         A.  Let's see.  No, I don't think so.
15         Q.  Okay.  Are you relying upon any of the
16   test data obtained during the exemplar testing in
17   support of any of your opinions?
18             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
19             THE WITNESS:  Yes.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Okay.  What opinions -- for what opinions
22   are you relying on exemplar test data and what
23   specific test data?
24         A.  Okay.  The results of our testing
25   indicated that there -- that when you change the air
0188
 1   damper settings on the combustion, on the combustion
 2   combustor unit, that it changes the carbon monoxide
 3   reading significantly.
 4             For example, you have to kind of fine tune
 5   the inlet air damper so that you get a reasonably
 6   clean burn.  If you close off that damper, you tend
 7   to develop -- generate a lot more carbon monoxide.
 8             So that one of the things that I learned
 9   from the test was that these variables, setting
10   these variables when you set up the oven for the
11   first time, it can be very tricky to get a clean
12   burning oven, and if you change any of the other
13   variables, like the back pressure, for example, then
14   the change -- then you will have a significant
15   effect on the combustion products that are
16   generated.  That's what I learned.
17         Q.  Okay.  So you say that changing the air
18   damper settings can affect the carbon monoxide
19   production substantially and it's difficult to sort
20   of fine tune the inlet air damper.
21             Were there baseline measurements taken of
22   carbon monoxide production with the oven as it was
23   presented?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
25             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I think I said that
0189
 1   initially.  Our initial tests were only of as
 2   presented.
 3   BY MR. CROSS:
 4         Q.  Right.  And were there measurements taken,
 5   CO measurements taken in the flue gas or the bake
 6   chamber or anywhere else in that condition before
 7   you started changing things?
 8         A.  Yes.
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
10             THE WITNESS:  The baseline conditions were
11   recorded.  They were part of Joe and Mr. Guthrie's
12   data that they developed, and I believe that was
13   presented in his deposition.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  All right.  So are you relying upon any
16   quantitative assessment of the data that was taken
17   during the exemplar testing, or is it the
18   qualitative point that you've identified for me that
19   changing the air damper setting can affect the CO
20   production substantially?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
22   argumentative.
23             THE WITNESS:  No.  What I'm relying on is
24   that by changing the air damper settings and turning
25   down from, say, 6 to around 2, something like that,
0190
 1   you can see the carbon monoxide going up from maybe
 2   in the hundreds to maybe 5,000.  So I mean it's a
 3   profound change in the combustion product just by
 4   changing the air damper.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Okay.  And are those COAF measurements?
 7         A.  They are.
 8         Q.  And where are those measurements taken?
 9         A.  Actually, they're both COAF and CO.  And
10   the measurements were taken about -- if I recall,
11   about six inches into the exhaust stack on that
12   oven.
13         Q.  Okay.  So those were taken from the -- not
14   the flue, but I guess into the top of the outlet at
15   the top of the oven?
16         A.  Yeah.  I believe the pipe stuck out maybe
17   a foot or something like that.
18         Q.  Okay.
19         A.  And Guthrie put the probe about as far
20   down into the outlet as he could.
21         Q.  And you could go from a couple of hundred
22   PPM COAF up to thousands of PPM just by adjusting
23   the air damper on that oven?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
25   ///
0191
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Is that what you just told me?
 3         A.  Yes, and they were recorded up to 5-,
 4   6,000.
 5         Q.  All right.  Do you intend to present any
 6   of the exemplar testing data or, again, is it just
 7   your awareness of the data feeds into this
 8   qualitative assessment that the air damper setting
 9   can have a profound effect on carbon monoxide
10   production?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and ambiguous
12   and calls for speculation in part.
13             THE WITNESS:  I would expect to refer to
14   Joe Romig on those opinions.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  So you've drawn me the qualitative
17   opinion you've expressed for us, and then Dr. Romig
18   will talk about the actual data that was derived
19   from the testing that he and his associate ran?
20         A.  Correct.
21             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  Okay.  Do you view the -- I guess the
24   opined sensitivity of the air damper setting to
25   carbon monoxide production as a design flaw with the
0192
 1   Wang burner?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 3   argumentative.
 4             Can I have the question read back, please.
 5             THE WITNESS:  I know the question.
 6             MR. JARCHI:  I want to object to it,
 7   though, so I want to hear the question again.
 8             (The record was read as follows:
 9             Q.   Do you view the -- I guess
10             the opined sensitivity of the
11             air damper setting to carbon
12             monoxide production as a design
13             flaw with the Wang burner?)
14             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
15   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical as to
16   foreseeability versus design flaw, argumentative.
17             THE WITNESS:  I don't see it as a design
18   flaw, no, for the combustion burner.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Okay.  So it's okay for it to have that
21   significant sensitivity from the air damper setting
22   to carbon monoxide production with that burner,
23   irrespective of what application it might be placed
24   into?
25             MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.
0193
 1             THE WITNESS:  Well, you're asking me to --
 2   asking me to say if it's okay.
 3   BY MR. CROSS:
 4         Q.  Yeah.
 5         A.  I don't know whether it's okay or not
 6   because I have to admit that I am not an expert in
 7   burners and I don't know how normally sensitive they
 8   are.
 9         Q.  All right.  Just to confirm, I know you
10   said you couldn't do a detailed analysis of the heat
11   exchanger.
12             Do you know whether the heat exchanger of
13   the exemplar oven that was tested in June of 2019,
14   whether it was intact or not?
15         A.  What was the last part of the question?
16         Q.  Was the heat exchanger of the exemplar
17   oven intact at the time you did your testing?
18         A.  It's my understanding that it was.
19             MR. CROSS:  Okay.  I'm ready to move to
20   another section and we've been going about an hour.
21   Why don't we take just a two-minute break or three
22   minutes, whatever you --
23             THE WITNESS:  Good idea.
24             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.
25   The time is 2:16 p.m.
0194
 1             (Whereupon, a recess was held
 2             from 2:16 p.m. to 2:32 p.m.)
 3             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the
 4   beginning of Video Media Number 3, the videotaped
 5   deposition of Dr. James William Jones.
 6             Going back on the record.  The time is
 7   2:32 p.m.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  All right, sir.  I know you're going to be
10   disappointed to learn that we are done talking about
11   your file contents and are ready to move on and talk
12   a little about those areas where you do have
13   opinions and those where you don't so we can
14   fine tune and drill in on what your opinions are,
15   okay?
16         A.  Okay.
17         Q.  We reviewed your CV earlier today, but am
18   I correct that you're not a medical doctor?
19         A.  I'm not.
20         Q.  And you don't claim any expertise in any
21   medical field?
22         A.  No, sir.
23         Q.  All right.  So you won't be opining on the
24   medical diagnoses or prognoses of any of the
25   plaintiffs in this case; correct?
0195
 1         A.  No.
 2         Q.  That is correct?
 3         A.  That is correct.  I will not.
 4         Q.  Okay.  You won't be offering any opinions
 5   on the alleged medical care that's required by any
 6   plaintiff; is that also right?
 7         A.  That's not my area of expertise.
 8         Q.  All right.  And you won't be addressing
 9   the alleged injuries any plaintiff suffered and the
10   damages they have allegedly incurred in this case;
11   true?
12             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
13             THE WITNESS:  I don't -- I can't think of
14   anytime I would.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  You are not an epidemiologist or a
17   toxicologist?
18         A.  No, I'm not.
19         Q.  Okay.  So am I right that you won't have
20   any opinions or testimony talking about the effects
21   of carbon monoxide intoxication on the human body?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
23             THE WITNESS:  I will not.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  Okay.  Do you plan to address any OSHA,
0196
 1   NIOSH, EPA or other health standards pertaining to
 2   carbon monoxide exposure?
 3         A.  Only peripherally in respect to how carbon
 4   monoxide was measured and whether or not that might
 5   exceed the requirements.
 6         Q.  Okay.  So you do plan on talking about the
 7   measurement of carbon monoxide in some fashion?
 8         A.  With respect to testimony that I read
 9   about a couple of our experts, there may be some
10   questions that come up about -- or that I would have
11   an opinion about, but the details of the effects on
12   the human body is not, and how you measure it, and
13   the difference between the different types of
14   measurements.  I don't expect to be -- I would defer
15   to others on that area -- in that area.
16         Q.  Okay.  So what I've got, just so I know
17   what the bounds of what you intend to talk about at
18   trial are, what measurements do you foresee
19   potentially discussing?
20         A.  The only measurements that I would
21   probably get into is if someone asks me, "Well, a
22   short time exposure to 200 parts per million carbon
23   monoxide, is that bad or good," and I would say,
24   "When it exceeds the certain limits, standards, that
25   sort of thing.  That's my understanding."  But it
0197
 1   would be peripherally that I would have an opinion
 2   about it.
 3         Q.  Okay.  What standards are you familiar
 4   with in terms of carbon monoxide exposure and in
 5   health effects?
 6         A.  Mainly, short.  You know, with long-term
 7   exposure, something around 9 parts per million for
 8   continuous exposure.
 9         Q.  You talking about the EPA standard?
10         A.  EPA standard.  But as I stated earlier.
11   And then there may be some questions about -- and I
12   read in some of the information that was generated
13   by ITW, that they require that if you exceed, say,
14   50 parts per million in your measurements, you
15   should start to adjust things so that they don't
16   exceed that or that they're below that.
17             But those would be -- again, that's a
18   peripheral part of my testimony.
19         Q.  I understand, I guess, how you're using
20   that word, but I guess I'd like to know:  Do you
21   plan on discussing any of the measurements, the
22   actual data obtained in this case from any -- either
23   the exemplar oven or the subject oven in terms of
24   the testimony you intend to present?
25             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
0198
 1             THE WITNESS:  No.  I would defer to our
 2   other experts.  But if somebody says, "Well, is it
 3   possible that by opening the door you could be
 4   exposed to that level," then I may have some
 5   opinions about what happened when you opened the
 6   door, airflow, that sort of thing.  That's why I say
 7   it's not beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would be
 8   interested in talking about that.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Okay.  And so some of the work you've done
11   is the ventilation hood effectiveness, for instance.
12         A.  Correct.
13         Q.  And so you could potentially rely on
14   somebody's opinion about how much carbon monoxide
15   was in the oven and what would happen if you opened
16   the door, based on your analysis of the vent hood?
17         A.  Say, for example, would a person standing
18   in front of the door, would they -- in my opinion,
19   how long would they not be exposed to it, the extent
20   of the exposure, that sort of thing.
21         Q.  Okay.
22         A.  Those -- that's why I can't say that I
23   would have no reference to those standards, but that
24   would be a peripheral role.
25         Q.  So I think I'm understanding you, then,
0199
 1   how you might use measurements provided by others,
 2   but as we stand here, you don't intend to offer
 3   affirmatively an opinion specifically that there was
 4   X parts per million present in the oven based on
 5   work that you did in this case?
 6         A.  I do not at this time have any reason to
 7   expect that I would do that.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Do you plan on addressing the
 9   propriety of using ambient carbon monoxide versus
10   carbon monoxide air-free measurements in assessing
11   health risks?
12         A.  No.  It is not my -- my opinions will not
13   try to justify one over the other.
14         Q.  Okay.  And you understand the OSHA, the
15   NIOSH and the EPA standards are all presented in
16   terms of ambient exposure rather than carbon
17   monoxide air-free?
18             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, misstate the
19   standards.
20             THE WITNESS:  I would say I'm not an
21   expert in that area so I wouldn't have an opinion
22   about it.
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  Okay.  You mentioned something about
25   carbon monoxide detectors earlier.
0200
 1             Do you intend on discussing the Underwriter
 2   Lab 2034 or any other detection thresholds for
 3   carbon monoxide detectors?
 4             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous, asked
 5   and answered.
 6             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  My only -- my only --
 7   what would you call it -- my only experience with
 8   that is I'm told that you'd have to have a minimum
 9   70 parts per million to set off one of those
10   detectors, and so I know that information, but I
11   don't know how I would use it in my testimony at
12   this point.
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  Okay.  Do you know if there's a durational
15   aspect as well as a quantitative aspect to the
16   detection threshold?
17         A.  I understand that there is.  I don't know
18   what it is.
19         Q.  Okay.  So that's not an area you plan to
20   offer opinions on as we sit here?
21         A.  No, I do not plan to testify in that area.
22         Q.  All right.  Am I right, then, that you're
23   also not going to offer any opinions or testimony
24   about carbon monoxide detector beeps, chirps or
25   other sounds that may or may not have been heard by
0201
 1   the various plaintiffs in this case?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 3             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  No, I'm not planning
 4   to offer testimony in that area.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  All right.  Now, this is -- this touches
 7   on one of the areas you said you might be
 8   peripherally involved in.
 9             Do you intend to try and offer any
10   opinions or testimony about the levels of carbon
11   monoxide, if any, actually inhaled by any of the
12   individual plaintiffs in this case?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
14             THE WITNESS:  The -- the only thing I've
15   done that would sort of get into that area would be
16   my analysis of the hood system.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Okay.  And so this would be the idea; that
19   if somebody provides you with or wants you to assume
20   there's X parts per million that are present in the
21   bake chamber, somebody opens the door and is
22   standing there, what will they be exposed to and for
23   how long, based on your analysis of the hood
24   efficiency?
25         A.  Something like that, yes.
0202
 1         Q.  Do you foresee --
 2             MR. JARCHI:  I'm sorry.  We lost her.
 3   I'll call her.
 4             (Whereupon, there was a brief
 5             pause in the proceedings.)
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  All right, sir.  Other than that sort of
 8   potential hypothetical where you're asked to discuss
 9   what somebody would likely be exposed to under those
10   assumptions, given the ventilator or hood efficiency
11   that you've calculated, is there any other manner in
12   which you anticipate providing opinions or testimony
13   about the amount or duration of carbon monoxide
14   inhaled by any individual plaintiff in this case?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
16   incomplete hypothetical.
17             THE WITNESS:  At this point, I can't think
18   of any.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Okay.  And that's fair.  I appreciate you
21   identifying and I understand how that might come
22   into play with the one you did identify.
23             Now, you indicated right before we broke
24   that you're not really a burner expert.
25             Do you intend to offer any opinions or
0203
 1   testimony about the alleged levels of carbon
 2   monoxide that the subject burner is capable of
 3   generating or the conditions under which it will do
 4   that?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered, and it
 6   misstates the prior testimony.
 7             THE WITNESS:  My testimony would probably
 8   be limited to my experience with this particular
 9   burner and the testing that we did on it.
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  Okay.  So I think what you indicated
12   earlier was you would defer to Dr. Romig on the
13   specific data, but you took away at least one
14   qualitative observation from that testing with
15   regard to the sensitivity of the air damper setting?
16         A.  Correct.  That's a good way of phrasing
17   it.
18         Q.  All right.  And beyond that, in terms of
19   the burner and its functionality, that's something
20   that you would be more inclined to defer to
21   Dr. Romig?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
23   incomplete hypothetical.
24             THE WITNESS:  If a situation arose that I
25   was asked to make calculations or otherwise evaluate
0204
 1   from a thermodynamic or fluid flow situation, I
 2   could probably make certain calculations.  But I
 3   haven't been asked to do that.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  Okay.  So you haven't been asked to do
 6   that, that's not something that's been produced to
 7   us in this case and that you're prepared to talk
 8   about as we sit here today?
 9         A.  Right.
10         Q.  Okay.  Would you agree that the creation
11   of carbon monoxide occurs only at the burner when
12   it's actively combusting?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,
14   vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
15             THE WITNESS:  The only -- I have read the
16   opinion of a metallurgist, Dr. -- I can't think of
17   his name anyway.  I'll think of it in a minute.
18             I believe he had an opinion that when you
19   start consuming metal and oxidizing it, you can
20   generate carbon monoxide.  I have not had a chance
21   to try that out myself, looking at the mechanics or
22   the physics of it, but that would be the only other
23   area that I could see that you could be generating
24   carbon monoxide --

 2         Q.  Okay.  So --
 3         A.  -- besides at the burner.
 4         Q.  Was it a deposition or a declaration of
 5   Mr. Hendrickson?
 6         A.  Yeah, Hendrickson.  I believe it was in
 7   his declaration, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.
 8         Q.  Okay.  So your understanding of at least a
 9   portion of Mr. Hendrickson's declaration is that the
10   process where the carbon steel tubes are actually
11   getting eaten away may create some amount of carbon
12   monoxide above and beyond the carbon monoxide
13   created by the combustion process?
14         A.  Again, yeah, that's something that jumps
15   into my memory.  It's been a while since I read
16   Dr. Hendrickson, and he had a fairly long and
17   involved declaration.  But that would be the only
18   other place I could see.
19             You kind of have to be burning something
20   to generate carbon monoxide.  About the only other
21   thing you're burning in here is the tubes.  So I
22   think that was my reasoning there.
23         Q.  Have you done any analysis or do you have
24   any understanding beyond what's expressed in
25   Mr. Hendrickson's declaration about this additional
0206
 1   generation of carbon monoxide from the burning of
 2   the carbon steel tubes?
 3         A.  No.
 4         Q.  Okay.  So it's just what he stated in his
 5   declaration?
 6         A.  And I guess I have to tell you, I'm not a
 7   hundred percent sure, but I do remember that, and I
 8   thought I would mention it.  You asked me if I knew
 9   of anything else and so I'm telling you that's best
10   of my recollection.
11         Q.  No, I appreciate that.  I just want to
12   make sure that it's just the declaration.
13             You haven't done any outside analysis or
14   assessment of that opinion?
15         A.  No.
16         Q.  Okay.  Based on the materials we've
17   marked, I take it you did attempt to assess the flue
18   gas temperatures present in the heat exchanger as
19   well as the related densities, pressures and flow
20   rates in the heat exchanger?
21         A.  Yes, I did.
22         Q.  And you analyzed the likely failure mode
23   of the heat exchanger, at least in part based on
24   that thermodynamic analysis and the stress analysis
25   that you did?
0207
 1         A.  Correct.
 2         Q.  And you also provided a critique of the
 3   design process leading to the heat exchanger as a
 4   result of that prior work as well?
 5         A.  I have.
 6         Q.  Based on all that work, is it your opinion
 7   that Hobart's use of the aluminized carbon steel
 8   tubes joined to stainless steel within the heat
 9   exchanger led to premature failure of that joinder?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative as
11   to premature failure, assumes facts, incomplete
12   hypothetical.
13             THE WITNESS:  Well, my opinion I think is
14   stated in my opinions; that I believe that the
15   design of the heat exchanger using carbon steel and
16   stainless steel welded together was a design defect.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Okay.  And was it a design defect because
19   it failed at all, or because it failed within a time
20   period that you view as being premature or not long
21   enough?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative and assumes
23   facts.
24             THE WITNESS:  In my opinion, it was a
25   design defect from day one because the potential for
0208
 1   cracking and deterioration was built in to the
 2   design.
 3   BY MR. CROSS:
 4         Q.  Okay.  So it was the mere fact of putting
 5   them together that was -- that presented a design
 6   defect, in your mind, rather than the in field
 7   performance of any given or population of heat
 8   exchangers?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
10   incomplete hypothetical.  It's compound and a false
11   dichotomy.
12             THE WITNESS:  Well, it's my opinion
13   that --
14             MR. CROSS:  Just -- I'm okay with the
15   proper legal objections, but there's got to be a
16   limit.  And this is a retained expert testifying
17   witness.  He's capable of protecting himself.
18             Go ahead and answer if you can.
19             THE WITNESS:  Would you mind reading back
20   the question?  I'm sorry.
21             (The record was read as follows:
22             Q.   So it was the mere fact of
23             putting them together that was --
24             that presented a design defect,
25             in your mind, rather than the
0209
 1             in field performance of any
 2             given or population of heat
 3             exchangers?)
 4             MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.
 5             THE WITNESS:  My answer is that given the
 6   operating temperature of this device, then using
 7   different metals with different expansion
 8   coefficients was a design defect.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Okay.  Have you attempted to identify a
11   specific date or time period within the subject --
12   within which the subject heat exchanger failed prior
13   to the 2002 inspection?
14         A.  I have not -- I have not attempted to do
15   that, no.
16         Q.  Okay.  Have you attempted to identify a
17   specific date or time frame when you believe
18   combustion products that included substantial
19   amounts of carbon monoxide were exiting a breach in
20   the subject heat exchanger and entering the
21   convection flow of the oven?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; assumes facts,
23   vague and ambiguous.  It's compound on many levels
24   and it's an incomplete hypothetical.
25             THE WITNESS:  I haven't made the
0210
 1   calculations to try to determine if I could back out
 2   from what I know today.  It would require me to do
 3   some kind of calculations, perhaps cyclic, the
 4   number of cycles, that sort of thing, to back out a
 5   date when I thought the first cracks occurred, based
 6   on how we found it whenever we took it out of
 7   service.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Okay.  So you would have to do additional
10   work you have not done at least through today to
11   figure out whether you were even capable of
12   estimating a date when the heat exchanger breached;
13   correct, or failed?
14         A.  Well, I know that it was breached in 2002.
15         Q.  Right.  We know at the time of the
16   inspection when replacement was recommended, it had
17   already been breached at that point.
18         A.  So how many years before that?
19         Q.  Or months or weeks or whatever?
20         A.  The question is:  Could I estimate the
21   date when the first cracks happened or came in to
22   that -- those welds.
23         Q.  That's the question, and I understood your
24   answer to be you'd have to do additional work that
25   you haven't done as we sit here today.
0211
 1         A.  Well, I believe that, you know, I can say
 2   that initial cracking probably occurred fairly soon
 3   after it started into use.  I would estimate no more
 4   than, say, a year before you started getting
 5   hairline cracks in there.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Are you getting escape of flue
 7   products from the cracks in the heat exchanger welds
 8   immediately upon creation of those cracks, or do
 9   they have to evolve into I guess a geometric size
10   and shape of some form before gas starts coming out
11   of the pipes?
12         A.  What happens in -- first of all, this is
13   normally what is referred to as low cycle fatigue,
14   okay?  The failure of that mode is what we call low
15   cycle fatigue.
16             My calculations indicate that every cycle
17   of this heat exchanger produced stresses that were
18   greater than the ultimate stress.  That doesn't
19   necessarily mean you get a crack on the first cycle,
20   but it means that if you don't -- you don't go very
21   many cycles until you start to fatigue the material
22   and start to get an incipient crack.
23             Once that crack initiates, it may not go
24   all the way through the weld.  Typically, it does
25   not.  So you're going to have more cycles happening
0212
 1   until the crack goes all the way through the weld,
 2   and now you have a breach in the heat exchanger.
 3             Initially, that will be a small crack and
 4   you won't get much of an emission through there.
 5   But a small crack grows, especially it's going to
 6   start to grow faster because you have combustion
 7   products going into that crack and now you're
 8   attacking the crack on all surfaces.
 9             So initially, you're only attacking the
10   inside of the tube, but after you grow a crack in
11   it, now you're attacking the whole crack all the way
12   through.
13             So the question that -- what I would have
14   to determine is -- I believe I could calculate the
15   number of cycles to initiate or at least approximate
16   that.  I could calculate the number of cracks to
17   grow it all the way through.
18             The thing that makes it more difficult is
19   to determine how fast the gap grows, and then that
20   depends on how much oxidation you're getting in the
21   tube and whether there's a flame present at that
22   point.  So it gets a little hairy.
23         Q.  Sure.
24         A.  I was trying to make those calculations,
25   but -- they're doable, but I guess to go back after
0213
 1   this longwinded answer, I believe you will get crack
 2   initiation and crack propagation fairly soon, within
 3   like a year of operating it.
 4         Q.  And I appreciate that.  You had told me
 5   that based on the calculations you did do you would
 6   assume within a year you're going to get crack
 7   initiation and propagation.
 8             My question, though, was:  Have you done
 9   the work to determine when you would actually start
10   getting escape of flue gases from whatever crack is
11   present at the weld?
12         A.  Well, you'll get escape of flue gases as
13   soon as you get a hairline crack.  They'll just be
14   small.
15         Q.  Okay.  Now, you're aware from your review
16   of the materials that there was about 8 parts per
17   million COAF measured being generated by the subject
18   burner when the crack was found in July of 2002 and
19   a replacement was recommended; correct?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the evidence, vague
21   and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
22             THE WITNESS:  We could look at that sheet.
23   It's on the inspection sheet.  I think I even
24   brought a copy of that with me.  But I think 8
25   sounds like a right number.  Maybe I didn't bring it
0214
 1   with me.
 2             But I know it's that -- the infamous
 3   inspection sheet that was generated by Mr. McGee at
 4   that inspection.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  All right.  Handing you what was produced
 7   and is in the file as ITWFEG 45 through 48.
 8             Do you recognize that as the inspection
 9   checklist for the subject oven?
10         A.  Yes, I do.
11         Q.  All right.  And what was the measurement
12   of carbon monoxide that was obtained in July of 2002
13   when Hobart inspected the subject oven?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous as to
15   where it's being measured from, incomplete
16   hypothetical.
17             MR. CROSS:  We'll get there if you give
18   him a shot.
19             THE WITNESS:  I'm reading from the sheet
20   here, and it says Co 8.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Okay.
23         A.  8 parts per million.
24         Q.  Do you know where that measurement was
25   taken?
0215
 1         A.  I do not know where that measurement was
 2   taken.
 3         Q.  Do you know if there was any measurable
 4   carbon monoxide inside the bake chamber as of July
 5   of 2002?
 6         A.  I do not know.  Best of my recollection,
 7   these measurements were taken in the stack and not
 8   in the bake chamber, but I've been known to
 9   misremember stuff like that.
10         Q.  What's your understanding of the ambient
11   levels of carbon monoxide present in the bake
12   chamber in 2010 after the oven was taken out of
13   service?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
15             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't recall.
16   Again, we have experts that specialize in making
17   those measurements and were there.  I wouldn't
18   venture an opinion in that area.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Okay.  Is it your opinion that the
21   condition of the heat exchanger got any better or
22   any less cracked at the point after crack initiation
23   began and propagated, or was it as bad as it was
24   going to get in 2010 when they took it out of
25   service?
0216
 1         A.  Again, I don't know that, and the reason
 2   is, this problem of cracking and carbon monoxide
 3   production is very interrelated.  As you've seen
 4   from our test, changing the amount of air in the
 5   burner airflow will change the amount of carbon
 6   monoxide that's generated so that as this crack
 7   grows, you change the air fuels mixture, and so you
 8   may be developing very high carbon monoxide at some
 9   point as the tube continues to fail and the gaps get
10   bigger and bigger.
11             So that's what I mean by it's interrelated.
12   the carbon monoxide production depends on how
13   much -- on the air-fuel mixture.  The more -- the
14   more you change that, you can have very high
15   variations in carbon monoxide production.  So that's
16   why I can't answer that question.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Really, my question was:  Does the crack
19   get any better or does it just continually get worse
20   over time so that when it's taken out of service in
21   September of 2010 it's as bad as it's ever been?
22         A.  I would say the crack's not going to get
23   well.
24         Q.  Okay.  It gets progressively worse over
25   time; it doesn't get bad and then get better and
0217
 1   then get worse again?
 2         A.  I don't think there's a mechanism for it
 3   to heal itself.
 4         Q.  Okay.  Now, what's your understanding of
 5   the age of the oven at the time of the 2002
 6   inspection?
 7         A.  This oven was built about 1996, something
 8   like that, and maybe put in service in '97.  I can't
 9   remember.  So in 2002, it would have been five years
10   old.
11         Q.  Five to six years old?
12         A.  Yeah, that's my understanding, best of my
13   recollection.
14         Q.  Did you obtain any information about the
15   average life expectancies of heat exchangers for
16   competitive commercial bakery ovens that were
17   designed and manufactured during the same time frame
18   as this oven?
19         A.  I did not.
20         Q.  In prior cases, have you viewed
21   comparisons with competitive products as per to the
22   analysis of the reasonableness of the design?
23         A.  Not really.  No, I -- well, first of all,
24   the people here at ITW were -- they had like 70,
25   80 percent of the market, so they were the leaders
0218
 1   in the market.  They were the predominant producers
 2   of ovens.
 3             Secondly, they seemed to me like they just
 4   copied their oven from another oven that was out
 5   there, so if they copied their oven from another
 6   oven that was out there, it wouldn't be much of a
 7   comparison; it would be comparing apples and apples
 8   and not apples and oranges.
 9             So therefore, I'm not sure that even if I
10   knew the failure rate for a competitor's oven, I'm
11   not sure it would be meaningful, because maybe
12   everybody is using the same design.
13         Q.  As of 1996, is it your belief that Hobart
14   controlled 70 to 80 percent of the commercial bakery
15   oven market?
16         A.  I don't remember the exact date, but I do
17   remember Mr. Casto talking about it in his
18   deposition.
19         Q.  Okay.
20         A.  And I believe he said 70 percent, and then
21   there's other indications that they may have been
22   80 percent.  I don't know the date of that, but it
23   was certainly about 2002 that they were the major
24   player in the market.
25         Q.  Do you have any understanding whether
0219
 1   anyone was producing a commercial bakery oven that
 2   had a heat exchanger that was -- that would not fail
 3   over the course of service life at some point in
 4   time and that had been designed and manufactured
 5   during the late 1980s, early to mid 1990s, whether
 6   anybody had that kind of product out there?
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
 8   ambiguous as to whether it's proven field experience
 9   or other products, incomplete hypothetical.
10             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I do not know the
11   answer to that question.
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  All right.  Do you recall working on a
14   case for the Watts Regulator Company about six years
15   ago?
16         A.  Probably.
17         Q.  Okay.  Did you look at the design of
18   toilet tank water supply nuts?
19         A.  Yes, sir.
20         Q.  Okay.  In that case, in addition to
21   extensive testing, did you examine competitive
22   products and industry standards in assessing the
23   reasonableness of the design at issue in that case?
24         A.  I did.
25         Q.  Do you think -- do you believe that a
0220
 1   commercial bakery oven or heat exchanger is at least
 2   as complex as the nut for the toilet tank supply?
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
 4   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, argumentative.
 5             THE WITNESS:  I would say yes.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  Okay.  Is there any particular reason that
 8   you opted not to examine the life expectancy of
 9   competitive product heat exchangers in assessing the
10   reasonableness of the performance of the subject
11   heat exchanger in this case?
12             MR. JARCHI:  That's been asked and
13   answered.
14             THE WITNESS:  I didn't have access to the
15   data.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  Okay.  Did you ask to go out and research
18   competitive product performance?
19             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
20             THE WITNESS:  No, I did not.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Do you plan to opine or testify that any
23   aspect of the heat exchanger design is defective,
24   other than the use of aluminized carbon steel tubes
25   welded to stainless steel?
0221
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; asked and
 2   answered, reflected in Exhibit 6, vague and
 3   ambiguous.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  Are you going to talk about any other
 6   aspect of the design of the heat exchanger besides
 7   the use of aluminized carbon steel tubes joined to
 8   stainless steel?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection; vague and
10   ambiguous.
11             THE WITNESS:  Well, I will say that when I
12   reviewed the design of the heat exchanger, I found
13   it defective in many ways.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Okay.  What is each aspect of the heat
16   exchanger that you find is defective?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Calls for a narrative as
18   reflected in Exhibit 6, vague and ambiguous,
19   incomplete hypothetical.
20             THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Having designed many
21   heat exchangers over the years, I looked at this
22   design and I can see a number of things that are
23   defective about it as far as the design goes.
24             Number one, the -- and of course the most
25   important is the use of dissimilar metals, welding
0222
 1   them together when you're going to have a high heat
 2   excursion.
 3             Number two, using boxes on the ends of the
 4   tube.  When you run the gas flow into a wall, flat
 5   wall, you are -- you're losing a tremendous amount
 6   of energy.  You're dissipating the kinetic energy of
 7   the airflow through the heat exchanger.  It hits the
 8   wall and becomes a stagnation condition.  It has to
 9   reaccelerate through the next layer of tubes going
10   the other way.  It hits that wall.  You lose
11   pressure back and forth, back and forth.
12             So your pressure drop to that heat
13   exchanger is going to be much higher than it could
14   be if you used some kind of a return bend.  Almost
15   all heat exchangers have return bends rather than
16   flat walls.
17             The next point that was a terrible part of
18   the design is that these tubes are inline.  If
19   you're going to get decent heat transfer, you need
20   to have staggered raise of tubes.  Staggered raise
21   of tubes greatly enhance the air-to-air heat
22   transfer between the heat exchanger and the two
23   cross loads.
24             You have the air flowing across these
25   tubes coming from the -- from the oven convection,
0223
 1   and then when you have inline tubes like this.  The
 2   tubes on the farthest side away from the air
 3   direction are going to be very ineffective in
 4   transferring their heat to the convection air.
 5             And then finally, the most important
 6   thing, probably, is that this heat exchanger is a
 7   safety component.
 8             In other industries, such as the nuclear
 9   industry, we often have a primary side and a
10   secondary side.  Here the primary side is the gas
11   going through that's heated.  The secondary side is
12   the convection air flowing across there.
13             The key to this heat exchanger is that you
14   don't want to mix those two together.  You do not
15   want to have combustion products going into the bake
16   chamber so that the heat exchanger is a
17   safety-related piece of equipment, and as such,
18   should be treated as such.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Okay.  So let me first ask you.  You had a
21   throw-off comment there that you've designed many
22   heat exchangers.
23             Can you identify for me each heat
24   exchanger you've designed over your career?
25         A.  Sure.  I started off my career in the
0224
 1   nuclear business.  I've designed heat exchangers for
 2   the Navy nuclear program for submarines and aircraft
 3   carriers.
 4             Next, after I finished my Ph.D., I went to
 5   work for Westinghouse as a consultant on the Clinch
 6   River breeder reactor.  Then I designed heat
 7   exchangers for sodium -- sodium heat exchangers.
 8             After that, I went and spent a lot of time
 9   in the commercial nuclear business designing heat
10   exchangers.
11             Then I progressed to the refining business
12   and worked in the refining business designing
13   literally thousands of heat exchangers.  Let's make
14   it hundreds.  I don't want to sound too old.  But I
15   had contracts with ARCO, other companies, refineries
16   where I rated and re-rated all the heat exchangers
17   in their -- in their refineries.
18             What else.  Those are the major ones.
19         Q.  All right.  So the Navy program and
20   Westinghouse, you were working with heat exchangers
21   involved with nuclear reactors?
22         A.  They were.
23         Q.  All right.  And then in terms of
24   commercial heat exchangers, you were looking at heat
25   exchangers in refineries, primarily with ARCO?
0225
 1         A.  No, probably ten different refineries.
 2         Q.  Okay.  And how are heat exchangers used in
 3   refineries?
 4         A.  Heat exchangers are used in refineries to
 5   transfer heat from a hot fluid or to a cold fluid,
 6   and they call -- in some cases, they call them
 7   regenerators, because when you have -- when you
 8   produce diesel gasoline, it's often produced at high
 9   temperatures, 1800 degrees, and rather than lose
10   that heat, you will go through a heat exchanger and
11   cool the product, the diesel or the gas, down to a
12   much lower temperature.  And you're using that heat
13   to heat up something else that you would have in a
14   reaction.  So refineries are very good about not
15   throwing away heat.  Heat costs money.  And so
16   basically, that's what heat exchangers are used for.
17             In this case, it's very similar.  You're
18   heating the heat exchanger with natural gas and
19   you're using that natural gas heated air to transfer
20   the heat to the bakery air.  So it's just a matter
21   of using the heat -- heating value of the natural
22   gas for baking bread.
23         Q.  So I want to go through the various
24   defects you identified.
25         A.  Sure.
0226
 1         Q.  The first one was that the use of
 2   dissimilar metals in an environment of high heat
 3   excursion.
 4             In your mind, that's what led to the
 5   failure of the welds and the breach of the heat
 6   exchanger in this case; correct?
 7         A.  Yes.
 8         Q.  So that alleged defect is directly related
 9   to the failure mode of the heat exchanger, in your
10   opinion?
11         A.  Correct.
12         Q.  Now, the second one you talked about was
13   the use of boxes on the end of the tubes rather than
14   a return bin type design, and the problem there was
15   you have stagnation where the flow has to stop
16   completely and then reverse itself, and that leads
17   to a pressure drop at the end of -- or at the
18   termination of each tube, essentially?
19         A.  Correct.
20         Q.  All right.  So ultimately, what you're
21   dealing with, then, is the flue gas is moving
22   through the heat exchanger under lower velocity or
23   pressure because it has to stop at the end of each
24   box?
25         A.  And you're not -- you're not -- you have
0227
 1   pressure drop through the heat exchanger so that you
 2   don't have as good a flow out the stack.
 3         Q.  Okay.  And the problem with that is
 4   because the pressure is lower and it's not moving as
 5   quickly, you're dissipating heat and you're losing
 6   heat, so it makes the heat exchanger less efficient?
 7         A.  Correct.
 8         Q.  All right.  Is there anything about the
 9   box ends as opposed to a return bin that in your
10   mind facilitated the failure of the heat exchanger,
11   or is it just an efficiency defect?
12         A.  No.  The fact that you're welding a tube
13   into a flat plate which forms the box is the worst
14   configuration.
15             The flat plate is very rigid in that
16   plane, whereas, the tube wants to expand due to
17   thermal expansion, and so therefore, you get the
18   maximum amount of stiffness preventing radial
19   expansion as opposed to if you have a cylinder into
20   a 180-degree bend, it wouldn't give you that.  Even
21   if they were dissimilar metals, the two cylinders
22   are much more compatible than a flat plate and a
23   cylinder.
24         Q.  Okay.  So the first thing we talked about
25   was the use of dissimilar metals that are going to
0228
 1   expand differently in comparison to temperature.
 2             This is a different aspect that looks at
 3   the geometry of the pipe coming into the box, and
 4   the stresses imposed by that geometry you're saying
 5   with a different shape of the return bin instead of
 6   a box, you would reduce the stresses imposed by that
 7   connection?
 8         A.  Correct.
 9         Q.  Okay.  Then the third item you talked
10   about was the use of inline tubes as opposed to some
11   sort of staggered matrix or configuration.
12             Again, is that alleged defect, in your
13   opinion, something that contributed to the failure
14   mode of the subject heat exchanger or something that
15   again just reduces efficiency?
16         A.  It -- I don't think it contributes to the
17   failure mode.  I can't think of any way it would,
18   but it will definitely reduce the efficiency of the
19   heat exchanger.
20         Q.  Okay.
21         A.  And probably make it larger than it needs
22   to be.
23         Q.  And then the last item you talked about
24   was you view the heat exchanger as a safety
25   component that -- and I guess, then, your opinion is
0229
 1   going to be that you should make sure that that
 2   doesn't fail, or what is your opinion with respect
 3   to why it's a defect, given that it's a safety
 4   component?
 5         A.  Well, it's a safety-related component.
 6   That means that you can't afford to have to breach
 7   that containment.
 8             You see it all the time in the nuclear
 9   business.  You have water with radiation in it
10   compared to fresh water on the other side.
11             You see it in refineries where you're
12   cooling two different fluids, and you -- and they
13   don't mix well.  You don't want to mix the two
14   components.  Sometimes you can get an explosion if
15   you do.  So all of those things.  It's safety
16   related in that if you get a breach in one, it could
17   cause an explosion or something bad could happen.
18         Q.  Okay.  Do you view automotive brakes as a
19   safety component of a vehicle?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
21             THE WITNESS:  Are brakes a safety
22   component?  Is that what you're saying?
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  Yes.
25         A.  Yes.
0230
 1         Q.  Should brakes be designed so that they
 2   never wear out?
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, incomplete
 4   hypothetical.
 5             THE WITNESS:  No.  That's a different
 6   philosophy and a different design project
 7   altogether.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Okay.  And how is it different?
10         A.  Brakes are a wear component.  Just like an
11   eraser on a pencil, tires on your car, there are
12   many things, and they wear by abrasion, okay,
13   abrasion.  Abrasion causes you to lose material on
14   something.
15             The heat exchanger doesn't have any
16   abrasion.  There's nothing grinding material off
17   causing material to be lost.  They should last
18   forever.
19         Q.  Okay.  Is it your opinion, then, that a
20   heat exchanger that is a wear item or something that
21   can fail within the service life of the product,
22   that it is a defective product?
23         A.  Well, if it lasts for 99 years, it would
24   be a very minor defect.  But it has to do with the
25   life expectation and the consequences of failure,
0231
 1   because the risk and the consequence of failure is
 2   one of the things that you have to take into account
 3   when you're doing design, and you cannot have a
 4   safety-related component that fails 27 percent of
 5   the time, okay?  It's unacceptable.
 6         Q.  Well, if it's something that is subject to
 7   stresses and is a wear item, as you've identified,
 8   won't eventually all of them fail if you -- under
 9   continued use?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
11   incomplete hypothetical.
12             THE WITNESS:  All of what fail?
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  Yeah.  Well, you indicated that -- with
15   wear items that -- you said you have to look at life
16   expectation and you have to look at consequences.
17         A.  Uh-huh.
18         Q.  So my question is:  If I'm looking at life
19   expectations, you're expecting that product to fail
20   at some point in time under continued use.
21             MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  That misstates
22   his testimony.
23             THE WITNESS:  I think I said that those
24   are examples of abrasions, abrasion failures.  I
25   didn't -- each one of them is caused by abrasion.
0232
 1   Pencil erasers, brakes, tires, all of those are
 2   abrasions.
 3             But other components, like your radiator
 4   in your car which is a heat exchanger, I've never
 5   seen anybody expect their radiator to fail before
 6   the tires go.  A radiator is a component that you
 7   expect to last throughout the life of your car.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Now.  Radiators used to fail all the time,
10   didn't they?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
12   misstates the evidence.
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  You'd see them on the side of the road
15   with the hood up and the steam coming out.
16             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative.
17             THE WITNESS:  Well, that wasn't the
18   radiator failing, by the way.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Okay.
21         A.  If you're on the side of the road with
22   steam coming out, you're probably overheating the
23   radiator, and the old Model A, Model Ts, they did
24   not have a pressurized radiator, so they could only
25   operate up to 212 degrees.
0233
 1             If it went above 212 degrees, you boiled
 2   all the water out and the car will be -- you better
 3   stop or you'll seize up the engine.  It's a
 4   different failure altogether.
 5         Q.  Okay.  Would you view the nozzle of a jet
 6   engine to be a safety component?
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 8             THE WITNESS:  It depends on the failure
 9   mode.  If it fails in a safe manner, it might not
10   be.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  Would you want to be on an airplane that
13   had the nozzle of the jet engine fail?
14         A.  As long as I had three more engines, I'd
15   probably be all right.  But, no, the answer is of
16   course not.  But the nozzle of jet engines are
17   designed not to fail.
18         Q.  Do you know if they need to be replaced
19   regularly?
20         A.  If they do, it's because of abrasion.  I
21   don't know how often you replace them.
22         Q.  So what in your mind is the abrasive
23   mechanism for a jet engine nozzle?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
25   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
0234
 1             THE WITNESS:  Hot gases coming up.
 2   BY MR. CROSS:
 3         Q.  Is that a thermal process or an abrasive
 4   process?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,
 6   vague and ambiguous.
 7             THE WITNESS:  It's probably more erosion
 8   caused by the high-velocity gases coming through
 9   there.
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  The turbines that you've had experience
12   working with, did you ever have to change out the
13   exhaust nozzles on those?
14         A.  I never worked with that part of it.
15         Q.  Okay.  We're going to come back,
16   obviously, to your opinions about the design of the
17   heat exchanger, but before we get too far afield,
18   let me ask you:  Do you intend to offer any opinions
19   or testimony critical of any other design aspect of
20   the DRO oven, other than the heat exchanger?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; asked and
22   answered, vague and ambiguous as reflected in his
23   opinions on Exhibit 6, incomplete hypothetical.
24             THE WITNESS:  Let me just say that my
25   opinions that I have already given you reflect
0235
 1   everything that I have today, and unless something
 2   else comes up and asks of me, I don't plan to have
 3   any more opinions.  So it's all right here in
 4   Exhibit 6.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Okay.  So Exhibit 6, to my view, anyway,
 7   talks about failures of the heat exchanger and
 8   sometimes potential consequences of those failures,
 9   but it doesn't address any other component or
10   process of the DRO oven.
11             All I'm trying to find out is if you're
12   going to say anything else with the DR0 oven is
13   defective besides the heat exchanger.
14         A.  At this time, I have no other criticisms
15   to offer.
16         Q.  Okay.  And you've indicated earlier you're
17   not really a burner guy so you're not going to be
18   calling the burner defective, irrespective of its
19   sensitivity to the air damper setting?
20         A.  No, sir, I'm not.  The burner operation
21   was a known and foreseeable part of the design
22   process.
23             Want to take a short one?
24         Q.  If you need one, sure.
25         A.  It's up to you.  You seem to be pondering.
0236
 1         Q.  Well, I'm cutting out some areas that we
 2   covered earlier.  I don't want to re-ask you the
 3   same questions.
 4         A.  I apologize, then.  Thank you for that.
 5         Q.  All right.  So we've been talking about
 6   the heat exchanger and your analysis of how and why
 7   it failed, as well as the fact that once it fails,
 8   it's going to start releasing flue gases into the
 9   convection flow that will enter the bake chamber.
10   And we've talked about your qualitative opinion that
11   if you open the door of a bake chamber, the flue gas
12   mixture that's present in the bake chamber is going
13   to come out and you will be exposed to it because of
14   the ineffectiveness of the vent hood.
15         A.  That's one reason, yes.
16         Q.  Okay.  You have not quantified either what
17   you believe is the amount of flue gas volume totally
18   or carbon monoxide percentage within the bake
19   chamber personally or how much would remain in
20   that -- in that breathing space or the duration at
21   this point in time; is that correct?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  I think we've gone through all that.  I
25   just want to make sure I don't --
0237
 1         A.  Well, my calculations do talk about dwell
 2   time, but --
 3         Q.  Okay.  Where's the dwell time within your
 4   calculations?  And I'm assuming this is somewhere in
 5   Exhibit Number 7?
 6         A.  8.
 7         Q.  No, 8.  Where's the references to dwell
 8   time?
 9         A.  Well, what I do is -- do you want me to
10   explain this and go through it?  If you don't --
11         Q.  Well, we're going to go through it in
12   detail.  I just want to know where you're
13   referencing dwell time specifically so when we talk
14   about this I ask you about it specifically.
15         A.  Okay.  Dwell time.  It turns out that when
16   I calculated the average velocity of the air
17   underneath the hood being drawn up by the fan, I get
18   a velocity.
19             And so if I -- I get one that turns out to
20   about one mile per hour, very slow, and so if it has
21   to go -- I get 1.6 foot per second.  So if it has to
22   go from the floor to the top and we've got 7, 8
23   feet, it would take about four seconds to get from
24   the bottom of the oven to the top.  That's assuming
25   that it's all being pulled into the vent.  That
0238
 1   gives me a dwell time of so long that I can
 2   calculate.
 3         Q.  Okay.  And other than this idea that it's
 4   going to take four seconds for the mixture that's
 5   coming out, in your opinion, at the bottom of the
 6   oven and making its way up into the vent hood, have
 7   you made any calculations with regard to dwell time,
 8   other than this ballpark four seconds?
 9         A.  Let me just -- yeah, but that's not the
10   only consideration.
11         Q.  Understood.
12         A.  Because the volume of gas inside of the
13   oven is much more than just the area underneath it.
14   So we'll have continually replenishing of that gas
15   coming out, and not all of it will be captured by
16   the hood.
17             So, you know, this four seconds is sort of
18   like a lower bound.  The actual time will be higher
19   than that.
20             But those are kind of -- you asked me will
21   I talk about that.  That's how I'll talk about it.
22         Q.  What I want to know is what you plan to
23   talk about at trial, the opinions and bases.
24             So I want to know what calculations,
25   modeling, simulations, anything you've done that
0239
 1   reflect what will happen when you open that door in
 2   terms of the exposure somebody standing in front of
 3   it will receive.
 4             Have you done anything like that to date?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Objection, vague and
 6   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
 7   BY MR. CROSS:
 8         Q.  Only what we see?
 9         A.  Only what I've presented, yes, sir.
10         Q.  And so what we have there is your
11   assessment of how fast the gas mixtures will move
12   towards the hood, but we don't have the other
13   variables you talked about that would come into play
14   in trying to figure out how much and for how long a
15   hypothetical person might be exposed?
16             MR. JARCHI:  Vague, incomplete
17   hypothetical.
18             THE WITNESS:  But the calculations do
19   allow you to make some other observations which I'll
20   talk about when we go through them in detail.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Okay.
23             MR. JARCHI:  Can we take a break?
24             MR. CROSS:  Yeah.
25             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  The
0240
 1   time is 3:33 p.m.
 2             (Whereupon, a recess was held
 3             from 3:33 p.m. to 3:47 p.m.)
 4             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the
 5   record.  The time is 3:47 p.m.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  All right, sir.  Right before we broke, we
 8   were talking about the movement of gases towards the
 9   vent hood and the speed and dwell times and all that
10   kind of stuff.
11             Before we start getting into a little more
12   detail on the calculations you've done, let me ask
13   you:  Have you addressed the ventilation
14   characteristics of the oven, other than with respect
15   to the ventilation hood?
16             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
17   incomplete hypothetical.
18             THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure I know what you
19   mean.  Ventilation oven with respect to the various
20   vents coming out?
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Sure.  Well, for -- and ventilation may
23   not be -- I guess more broadly, the fluid dynamics
24   of the oven with regard to the flows, other than
25   with regard to -- other than with respect to the
0241
 1   ventilation hood and the exhausting of the gases.
 2         A.  Well, I did these calculations shown in
 3   Exhibit 7.
 4         Q.  Okay.  And that's the burner combustion
 5   calculations?
 6         A.  It is.
 7         Q.  Okay.  And within your combustion pressure
 8   calculations, do you recognize that the burner motor
 9   continues to run and to inject fresh air into the
10   heat exchanger after burner combustion ceases?
11         A.  I do.
12         Q.  All right.  And did you analyze the burn
13   cycles to determine the respective durations for
14   when the burner is firing and combustion's occurring
15   as to opposed to when the burner's off and fresh air
16   is being blown in?
17         A.  The only thing I -- I don't have detailed
18   time of duration of, but I did read the depositions
19   of some of the people who worked in the bakery,
20   Julie Lee, and they talked about opening the oven 70
21   times a day, some large number of times a day, with
22   variations of it, and checking to see if things were
23   done, taking some things out, putting other things
24   in.
25             So it seemed to me like it was a very
0242
 1   on/off situation where it would be intermittently
 2   starting up and shutting down.
 3         Q.  Does that make any sense to you from a
 4   common sense standpoint, opening the door that often
 5   when you're trying to bake something?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative.
 7             THE WITNESS:  I have to tell you I never
 8   worked in a bakery, so I don't have a feel for
 9   how -- I know it seems like whenever I'm trying to
10   bake cookies, I open it about 100 times and it keeps
11   it cold all the time.  So my cookies take a lot
12   longer to get done than they would if I left the
13   damned thing shut.  But that's just me.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Okay.  So I guess back to my question,
16   then:  Have you done any sort of calculations to
17   figure out how frequently during a given cook cycle
18   the burner is on and it's combusting versus the
19   duration that the burner is off and it's blowing
20   fresh air?
21         A.  I have not.  I have no way of estimating
22   the duration.  I just had to go -- like I say, go by
23   the depositions and their estimates of how often
24   they open and close the oven.
25         Q.  Okay.  And the burner's going to turn off
0243
 1   every time they open the oven door; right?
 2         A.  It will.
 3         Q.  So it's going to be blowing fresh air and
 4   every time you open the door as well as whenever the
 5   burner clicks off because it's reached its
 6   temperature?
 7         A.  Correct.  That's what I got out of reading
 8   their manuals.
 9         Q.  Okay.  So I've asked you about durations.
10   I know you did some work looking at relative
11   pressures of the gases when it's combusting versus
12   the fresh air when it's not under combustion.
13         A.  Correct.
14         Q.  Did you do any volumetric analysis to
15   determine the respective total volumes of combustion
16   gases created during combustion versus fresh air
17   injected when the burner's off over the course of a
18   typical cooking cycle?
19             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
20   incomplete hypothetical, compound.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  I'm just asking you if you did any
23   calculations under any assumptions.
24             MR. JARCHI:  Object --
25             THE WITNESS:  I did not try to calculate
0244
 1   the total volume of air.  What I was looking at is
 2   the relative velocities when the combustion was on
 3   and when it was off.  That was my goal here.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  All right.  Do you know what the duty
 6   cycle of the burner is if you have a basic cycle of
 7   20 minutes?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  In other words, how -- for what period of
11   time is the burner on by design within a 20-minute
12   bake cycle?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
14   incomplete hypothetical.
15             THE WITNESS:  I don't know, but it seems
16   to me like that would depend on what the temperature
17   the oven is set at.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  Okay.
20         A.  If you're running at 325, it's probably
21   much less time on than if you're trying to bake at
22   450 or something like that.  So I thought about it,
23   but I don't have any way of knowing unless I
24   measured it how efficient this burner is in keeping
25   the temperature.
0245
 1             And also, there's another variable in
 2   there, is how much you're willing to let the
 3   temperature change inside of the baking area.  I
 4   know that from my own experience with my own heater
 5   cycle in the house, the thermostat is set to have a
 6   range.
 7         Q.  Sure.
 8         A.  And so if I set it on 70 degrees, if it
 9   drops below 70 degrees to 65 or whatever, whatever
10   the number is, the burner kicks on and heats it up,
11   and it always overshoots a little bit.
12         Q.  Sure.
13         A.  So if it's -- if it's, you know, 20
14   degrees below zero outside, it's on a lot more than
15   it is when its 65.  So there's just too many
16   variables for me to try to figure it out without
17   having to do measurements.  That's the bottom line
18   here.
19         Q.  And you haven't done those measurements?
20         A.  I have not done that, no.
21         Q.  Now, we talked earlier about the draft
22   inducer or flue stack fan or whatever you want to
23   call it.
24             You're aware that on an oven as installed
25   at a commercial setting that you're going to have
0246
 1   the flue stack attached to the outlet pipe for the
 2   flue and there's going to be a draft inducer or
 3   stack fan within that flue stack?
 4         A.  I do understand that, yes.
 5         Q.  What's the purpose of a draft inducer?
 6   What's it supposed to do?
 7         A.  Well, the draft inducer is supposed to
 8   pull the combustion products out of the stack and
 9   make sure they get dumped into the atmosphere.
10         Q.  Do you know what the efficiency of the
11   draft inducer designed for the subject oven is?
12             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
13             THE WITNESS:  I don't know what the
14   efficiency is, no.
15   BY MR. CROSS:
16         Q.  Okay.  And have you tried to determine the
17   airflow rates or the volumetric mass of air being
18   pulled by the draft inducer through the heat
19   exchanger?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Compound, vague and
21   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
22             THE WITNESS:  No, but what I did do is I
23   looked at the -- at the specification, and that's on
24   Page 15 of your installation instructions for --
25   ///
0247
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.
 3         A.  -- the 505.  And under one of the things
 4   that they actually ask you to do here is in the
 5   initial startup to check the draft at the location
 6   of the pipe three inches below the barometric damper
 7   and adjust to minus .04 to minus .08 inches of water
 8   column.
 9             So what that tells me is that there's a
10   very small vacuum that's in the stack that's
11   generated by this draft inducer.
12         Q.  Okay.  So it's creating a negative
13   pressure through at least part of the stack and part
14   of the heat exchanger?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates facts, misstates
16   testimony.
17             THE WITNESS:  It's creating -- it's
18   attempting to create enough of a vacuum to pull the
19   stack gases out and dump them into the atmosphere.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Okay.  Did you do any measurement or
22   analysis of the effect on the flow rate of the gases
23   within the heat exchanger you would anticipate if
24   the draft inducer was doing what it was designed to
25   do?
0248
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  That's a compound
 2   question, measuring or analysis, and to the extent
 3   you're asking for analysis, it's been asked and
 4   answered.
 5             THE WITNESS:  Well, what I did do was to
 6   compare the amount of vacuum that's induced by
 7   the -- what do you call this thing again?  I never
 8   did know -- but by this --
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Stack fan draft inducer?
11         A.  Draft inducer, yeah.  And the thing that
12   struck me when I read that was that the amount of
13   vacuum it produces is .04 to .08 inches of water.
14             And so just to put that in perspective,
15   that little 8 horsepower motor that you have at the
16   blower, it develops somewhere between 1 and 1.4
17   inches of water, and so even if it's only 1 inch of
18   water and this is .08, you know, we're talking about
19   a factor of 10 or something on the difference.
20   You're pulling air up with this draft inducer;
21   you're pushing air up with the blower.
22             Another way I thought about it is that if
23   you want to know how much vacuum .04 inches of water
24   is, think about putting a straw into a McDonald's
25   and sucking on it until the water rises 04 inches,
0249
 1   which is the thickness of a credit card.  That
 2   didn't strike me as enough vacuum to do very much.
 3             So I looked at that and I said, "Well, the
 4   fan on the" -- "on the blower is producing a hell of
 5   a lot more pressure at the inlet to the heat
 6   exchanger than this draft inducer is causing back in
 7   up at the stack.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Are you familiar with the term neutral
10   pressure level?
11         A.  Neutral --
12         Q.  Neutral pressure level.
13             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
14   incomplete hypothetical, form.
15             THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm not sure I know
16   what neutral pressure level means.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  All right.  Within a flue environment or
19   chimney environment, are there a range of pressures
20   from positive to negative with a neutral spot
21   somewhere in between the two?
22         A.  Well, there can be.  They're not
23   necessarily.
24         Q.  Okay.  Did you identify whether or not
25   there is a neutral pressure level anywhere within
0250
 1   the heat exchanger for the subject oven?
 2             MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered,
 3   incomplete hypothetical.
 4             THE WITNESS:  And I -- I did not, no.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Did you attempt to analyze -- you've
 7   talked about back pressure a couple of times --
 8   whether the draft inducer would have any impact on
 9   the back pressure that you've opined on a couple
10   times today?
11         A.  I considered that, yeah.  I thought about
12   that long and hard, and one of the things that I
13   concluded was that it takes a lot more -- you have
14   to push a lot harder from the bottom of the heat
15   exchanger.  You have to create enough pressure to
16   cause the gas to go through the heat exchanger
17   because it's ineffective as a blow area.  And so you
18   get a big pressure drop through the heat exchanger.
19             So if this little small vacuum up at the
20   stack is trying to pull something from the bottom of
21   the heat exchanger, the inlet area where the burner
22   is, it's got a hell of a job.
23             If you're going to have .04 or .08 inches
24   of vacuum up there, it's not going to do much.
25         Q.  All right.  Now, you've talked about the
0251
 1   1.4 to 1.8 inches of water column pressure down at
 2   the burner.
 3         A.  No, I talked about it at the stack, in the
 4   stack.
 5         Q.  In the stack.
 6         A.  .04 to .08.
 7         Q.  No, no, I'm switching now.
 8             So you're talking about the draft inducer
 9   and the suction that it's creating.
10         A.  Right.
11         Q.  Previously, we were talking about 1.4 to
12   1.8 inches of water column down --
13         A.  In the -- in the combustion chamber before
14   you start the fire.
15         Q.  And that's my question.
16             And that was related to your understanding
17   of the pressure switches?
18         A.  Yeah, the pressure switches have to sense
19   that you're getting a positive pressure there, which
20   means that the fan is on.
21         Q.  And is it your understanding that the
22   sensors for the pressure switches are in the
23   combustion chamber itself as opposed to somewhere
24   else within the burner assembly?
25             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
0252
 1   incomplete hypothetical, form.
 2             THE WITNESS:  My understanding is that
 3   they are measuring the pressure on the outlet of the
 4   fan.  In other words, where the fan is on the
 5   combustor, there's an area there that they measure
 6   the pressure.  And I believe that the combustion
 7   chamber is so large, such a large flow area is not
 8   going to change much from that value.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Okay.  So your understanding of where the
11   sensor measures the pressure is right at the outlet
12   for the burner motor and that you believe that the
13   pressure within the combustion chamber is going to
14   be roughly the same?
15         A.  I believe so, yeah.
16         Q.  Okay.
17             MR. JARCHI:  And also, vague and
18   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical on the last two
19   questions.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  In your discussions with the mystery
22   animators, did you ask them to take them into
23   account any effect of the draft inducer or stack fan
24   when they were modeling the flow of gases through
25   the heat exchanger?
0253
 1         A.  No.  I just told them to show flowing
 2   gases flowing through the heat exchanger.  We did
 3   not try to simulate velocity or pressure.  It was
 4   just purposes of illustrating how the flow goes
 5   through the heat exchanger.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Again, more of a qualitative
 7   assessment of here's where the gas goes when it's
 8   working the way it should, here's where it goes when
 9   there's a breach, as opposed to some sort of
10   quantitative simulation of what's happening in the
11   real world.
12         A.  Correct.  I did not attempt to simulate
13   physically, using physics equations, the flow.
14         Q.  Okay.  All right.  So we've been talking
15   about the ventilation present in the combustion
16   chamber and the heat exchanger, but there's also an
17   overpressure vent present in the bake chamber
18   itself; true?
19         A.  Correct.
20             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 9 was
21             marked for identification by the
22             deposition reporter and is attached
23             hereto.)
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  So I'm going to hand you two photographs
0254
 1   that I've marked as Exhibit 9 and ask you if you
 2   recognize these as two of the photographs that you
 3   took --
 4         A.  In June, I think.
 5         Q.  Yeah, in June of 2019?
 6         A.  Correct.
 7         Q.  And do those photographs include the
 8   overpressure vent present inside the bake chamber
 9   that we've been discussing?
10         A.  Yeah.  It's my understanding that that is
11   the inlet to the overpressure vent.
12         Q.  Okay.  And you said "that."  If I hand you
13   a --
14             Do you have a marker?
15         A.  That (indicating).
16         Q.  Can you circle the inlet in the
17   overpressure vent that you're showing us and hold
18   that up for the camera for us?
19             (Witness complied.)
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  All right.  And do you know what the
22   dimensions are for that overpressure vent inlet?
23         A.  I don't recall.  I don't think I measured
24   it.
25         Q.  Okay.  Is it your understanding that that
0255
 1   overpressure vent leads to an exhaust up on the top
 2   of the oven?
 3         A.  It is my understanding that that's true.
 4         Q.  Okay.  And I know you said there wasn't
 5   any ventilation present when you were looking at the
 6   oven in June of this year, but typically, would that
 7   ventilation that's exiting the top of the oven into
 8   which the overpressure vent is attached, would that
 9   typically be then ducted out to the roof to exhaust
10   outside the environment of the oven?
11         A.  That's correct.  That's my understanding.
12         Q.  Okay.  What's the purpose of the
13   overpressure vent?
14         A.  Overpressure vent primarily is there
15   because during the baking cycle, occasionally you
16   want to call for steam in the bake chamber.  And
17   when that happens, you have a water supply that
18   sprays water on these steel spherical balls that are
19   part of the -- part of the mechanism of the oven,
20   and when you spray water on those balls, which are
21   hotter than the boiling point of water, they flash
22   into steam, and when you flash water into steam, you
23   get a volume increase of about 998 to 1.
24         Q.  Okay.  And so this is one mechanism of
25   allowing that excessive pressure we talked about
0256
 1   when steam's injected into the bake chamber to
 2   escape the bake chamber, other than --
 3         A.  Otherwise, you might overpressure the bake
 4   chamber and you could cause leaking out the door.
 5   In extreme cases, if you had a good enough seal, you
 6   could blow the door right off of it.
 7         Q.  Okay.  What would be the effect of the
 8   overpressure vent in the bake chamber during the
 9   remainder of the bake cycle when there is no steam
10   being introduced into that environment?
11         A.  The only function that I would think it
12   would -- or I could see that it would have would be
13   that if for any reason the baking chamber pressure
14   tended to exceed atmospheric pressure, then the
15   excess pressure could go up the vent, and it would
16   keep the bake chamber essentially at atmospheric
17   pressure.
18         Q.  Okay.  And would you anticipate, absent
19   the introduction of steam, any other mechanism
20   allowing the atmosphere in the bake chamber to
21   exceed -- the pressure in the bake chamber to exceed
22   atmospheric pressure, given the presence of the
23   overpressure vent?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, argumentative,
25   incomplete hypothetical.
0257
 1             THE WITNESS:  Well, as long as there's a
 2   sizable vent and assuming that you don't introduce
 3   some pressure explosion, such as has happened, then
 4   you will -- and the amount of gas that you put into
 5   the bake chamber is slow enough filling it, then
 6   that pressure should be vented out through this vent
 7   and you should not develop an overpressure in the
 8   bake chamber.
 9         Q.  All right.  And I think what you've said
10   is that other than the sort of event where you're
11   introducing steam or something that's going to
12   expand way too rapidly to the overpressure vent to
13   accommodate, you would anticipate the environment in
14   the bake chamber to be roughly atmospheric?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the
16   testimony, incomplete hypothetical.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Does that misstate your testimony or is
19   that what you just told me?
20         A.  My opinion that as long as you don't have
21   some type of explosion or really fast expansion of
22   the gas, this vent should maintain essentially
23   atmospheric pressure in the bake chamber.
24         Q.  Okay.  And when you say the rapid
25   introduction of gas, you're not talking about the
0258
 1   convection flow that you're hypothesizing happens
 2   with the breach in the heat exchanger; you're
 3   talking about something like steam where you have a
 4   really exponential increase in the pressure in that
 5   environment in a short period of time?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  That misstates the testimony,
 7   incomplete hypothetical.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Does that misstate your testimony or is
10   that what you just told me?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony,
12   incomplete hypothetical.
13             THE WITNESS:  What I intended to convey is
14   that there's only a couple of ways you could have a
15   very quick expansion of gas.  One of them would be
16   the steam cycle and the other one would be if you
17   ignited some kind of a gas in there, like there were
18   certain cases where there was an explosion and the
19   vent wasn't capable of venting it fast enough to
20   keep it from causing damage.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  So the steam cycle or some sort of
23   detonation or deflagration of combustion gases
24   within the bake chamber itself?
25         A.  Correct.
0259
 1         Q.  Otherwise, you would expect the atmosphere
 2   to be roughly atmospheric -- I'm sorry -- the
 3   pressure to be roughly atmospheric?
 4             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony,
 5   incomplete hypothetical.
 6             THE WITNESS:  I think the pressure would
 7   be reasonably close to atmospheric.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.
10         A.  So venting to the atmosphere, yes.
11         Q.  Putting aside the ventilation on the oven
12   side, we've talked a little bit about the combustion
13   chamber, the heat exchanger and now the overpressure
14   vent, and earlier we touched on the ventilation
15   hood.
16             Did you perform any testing or analysis of
17   the ventilation characteristics or fluid dynamics
18   present in the bakery space generally, the bakery at
19   Albertsons where the oven was located?
20         A.  No, I did not.
21         Q.  Have you been provided any such data to
22   analyze so that you could consider the ventilation
23   characteristics of the broader space in which the
24   oven is positioned?
25         A.  I haven't done that.
0260
 1         Q.  Have you been provided any information
 2   about the air exchange rate per hour in the bakery?
 3         A.  The air --
 4         Q.  The air exchange, the ACH in the bakery,
 5   how frequently the air gets changed within that
 6   space?
 7         A.  No, I haven't looked at that, no.
 8         Q.  Would you need to know that sort of
 9   information in order to perform the -- the dwell
10   calculations you talked about and how long somebody
11   could hypothetically be exposed to escaping flue
12   gases into the bakery environment, given your
13   analysis of the vent hood effect?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Compound, incomplete
15   hypothetical, vague and ambiguous, form.
16             THE WITNESS:  Well, based on my
17   experience, the air exchange rate in these types of
18   places is fairly low, fairly long.  It takes a long
19   time to completely change the air in there.  I'm
20   assuming that the air is essentially static whenever
21   I made my calculations.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  Okay.  So you haven't done the analysis,
24   but for purposes of the opinions you gave and the
25   calculations you were contemplating, you were
0261
 1   assuming essentially static air within the bakery?
 2         A.  I'm assuming that the rate of replacement
 3   air in the bakery is relatively long compared to the
 4   exposure time of the personnel, is what I'm
 5   assuming.
 6         Q.  All right.  When you say "relatively
 7   long," can you give me some idea of the sort of
 8   assumption that would be required for your, I guess,
 9   disregard of the HVAC characteristics of the bakery
10   and the calculations that you would be
11   contemplating?
12         A.  Well, I know the average airflow in any
13   room due to HVAC is extremely low, if you take the
14   average over the whole room.
15             And I'm assuming that the people, whenever
16   you open the door, the first five to ten seconds
17   you're going to get a tremendous amount of high
18   concentration so that the two what I call dwell
19   times, the time that you would be exposed compared
20   to the time it would take to replace the air with
21   fresh air are long enough -- the difference is long
22   enough so that you can assume essentially a static
23   bakery atmosphere.
24         Q.  Okay.  So the calculations you're talking
25   about are just sort of on the magnitude of four
0262
 1   seconds or whatever that we talked about of the gas
 2   getting up to the vent hood area, in comparison to
 3   how long it's going to take the entire area to
 4   exchange air; is that --
 5         A.  No.  I think you -- I didn't say four
 6   seconds of exposure time.  I said if you took the
 7   average velocity, it would take about four seconds,
 8   but that doesn't mean that you're going to actually
 9   evacuate that air out of the hood.  There still be
10   would be a tremendous amount of the concentration of
11   what was in the chamber around the oven, and so that
12   might last for considerably longer than four
13   seconds.  But I used four seconds as the average
14   time it would take to get the velocity to bring the
15   air up from the floor to the hood.
16         Q.  So have you analyzed or -- I know you
17   haven't measured, but have you analyzed how long you
18   would anticipate flue gases escaping from the bake
19   chamber to remain in the area of a hypothetical
20   person standing in front of a door -- you know, you
21   said four seconds, so it's going to be longer than
22   that, but do you have any idea how long that it
23   would be?
24         A.  Haven't made that calculation.  But it
25   would be in terms maybe four, four to five times,
0263
 1   say half a minute --
 2         Q.  Okay.
 3         A.  -- for the maximum exposure.
 4         Q.  Right.
 5         A.  And then it would kind of settle down to
 6   what was the average in the room.
 7         Q.  Okay.  And then I guess my question is:
 8   So if you have 30 seconds' exposure to maximum --
 9         A.  CO.
10         Q.  -- CO, then that is what you're comparing
11   to the amount of time it would take to completely
12   change out of the bakery, and as long as that
13   relationship is big enough, then you can assume
14   stagnant conditions?
15         A.  I'm assuming that the average velocity of
16   air leaving the room being replaced by fresh air is
17   much longer than the exposure time of the maximum
18   amount of carbon monoxide.
19         Q.  All right.  And you, as we're sitting
20   here, have come up with perhaps maybe 30 seconds or
21   something like that?
22         A.  And that's just a number that I think is
23   reasonable, but I haven't calculated it.
24         Q.  Okay.  All right.  I'm with you.
25             Now, I know you provided some input and a
0264
 1   couple of PowerPoint slides to the animators.
 2             Were you asked to do any modeling, like
 3   true engineering modeling or simulations for this
 4   case?
 5         A.  No.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Did you make it known that you had
 7   a company for 20-plus years and you're pretty good
 8   at doing like reality engineering models and
 9   simulations?
10         A.  Yes.
11         Q.  Are you relying upon the animations that
12   you've seen to support your opinions in this case
13   beyond the qualitative idea that this is how the
14   gases flow?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates his testimony,
16   vague and ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
17             THE WITNESS:  I'm relying on them to
18   illustrate the different modes of operation with or
19   without the holes in the tubes, basically what I'm
20   using that for.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  In the first animation, you show the, I
23   guess, qualitative aspects of the gas flow on an
24   intact heat exchanger, or basically the way it
25   should work; right?
0265
 1         A.  Right.
 2         Q.  One of the things that I noticed was that
 3   when you are discussing the introduction of burner
 4   or production of carbon monoxide, essentially, the
 5   gas that's reflected going through the tubes and out
 6   the flue changes from white to all dark green.
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the animation.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Well, the animation shows what it shows.
10             My question is:  Was there any effort to,
11   I guess -- is the color of the gas intending to
12   reflect carbon monoxide content adjusted at all for
13   the quantitative content of the carbon monoxide, or
14   is it just all painted green to let us know that,
15   okay, now there's flue gases that contain some
16   amount of carbon monoxide somewhere in there?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
18   incomplete hypothetical.
19             THE WITNESS:  We changed the color just to
20   differentiate between the two types of flow.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Okay.  So there's either fresh air or
23   there's combustion gases running through?
24         A.  Correct.
25         Q.  Okay.  In the second animation when you
0266
 1   showed a breach and carbon monoxide entering the
 2   bake chamber over time, it appears that there's a
 3   greater and greater volume of gas within the bake
 4   chamber.
 5             Am I correct that that animation is not
 6   taking into account any effect of the overpressure
 7   vent?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts that the
 9   overpressure would do anything new with that.
10   Argumentative, incomplete hypothetical.
11             THE WITNESS:  Again, the purpose of the
12   animation is to try to illustrate the overall
13   assumption that when you have breaches in the tubes
14   that you can get carbon monoxide flowing into the
15   bake chamber.  I'm really not trying to do much else
16   besides illustrate that basic concept.
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  Okay.
19         A.  So that, you know, if we play that before
20   the jury, they will be able to see how breaching
21   these tubes will introduce combustion products into
22   the bake chamber.  It is intended to be a
23   quantitative.  It's not going to turn from light
24   green to dark green and have little whatever.  It's
25   just going to be an overall depiction of what might
0267
 1   occur as a result of the failed tubes.
 2         Q.  All right.  And similarly, if we see it
 3   becoming more dense or turning more green, that
 4   doesn't mean in reality you're actually getting a
 5   greater volume or a higher pressure of the gases in
 6   the bake chamber; it's just "I'm showing you the
 7   general process by which combustion products can
 8   enter the bake chamber"?
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
10   incomplete hypothetical, misstates the testimony.
11             THE WITNESS:  Well, just to clarify, I do
12   believe that when you start the burner and you're
13   having combustion gases introduced into the bake
14   chamber, the bake chamber, if it's been opened
15   recently and left open for some length of time, it
16   might be more atmospheric air with a little carbon
17   monoxide or combustion product, but over time, as
18   you're continuing to burn, you will introduce more
19   and more carbon monoxide, and the concentration of
20   carbon monoxide in the bake chamber will tend to
21   increase.
22             And one of the kind of interesting things
23   is, since this stuff is probably going to be hotter
24   than what's in the bake chamber, it's going to
25   force -- it's going to go up and it will force the
0268
 1   cooler air inside the bake chamber out the vent
 2   here.  So it's possible to replace most of the air
 3   in the bake chamber with the carbon monoxide -- with
 4   the combustion products.
 5             So it has a -- there's a mechanism by
 6   which you can increase the concentration over time
 7   as long as the burner is working.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Okay.  Have you seen any testing data to
10   support the idea that absolute concentration over
11   time is going to increase as you allow the burner to
12   continue burning with a failed heat exchanger?
13         A.  I haven't seen any test data to that
14   effect, but I believe my analysis of how it would
15   work is true.
16         Q.  Okay.  And what you're telling me also, I
17   guess, is this idea that you got a flue effect with
18   the carbon -- with the combustion gases.  The
19   mixture in the bake chamber that comprises
20   combustion gases are going to migrate to the roof
21   area and you're going to have cooler air displaced
22   and pushed to the bottom?
23         A.  Yeah, relatively speaking.  The
24   combustion -- when you're coming right off the
25   combustion chamber, that's when you're going to have
0269
 1   your hottest air, your hottest air products,
 2   combustion products, and we know that the design,
 3   according to Mills, goes up to 1600 degrees
 4   Fahrenheit.  They're designing for numbers up to
 5   1600 degrees in his testimony.
 6             But let's just say they're 1400 degrees.
 7   We'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  I also
 8   believe that you're going to have an overpressure
 9   there forcing that hot air into the bake chamber,
10   because I believe the pressure in the heat exchanger
11   will be higher than the pressure in the bake
12   chamber.  Because as you pointed out, the bake
13   chamber is vented to the atmosphere, so it's going
14   to maintain about atmospheric pressure; whereas, we
15   know the combustor is going to increase the
16   pressure.  So you're going to be blowing hot
17   combustion products into the bake chamber.
18             Logically, they rise to the top of the
19   bake chamber, and as they fill the bake chamber,
20   you're going to be pushing the colder air that might
21   be more nearly atmospheric conditions out the vent,
22   because it vents from the bottom.
23         Q.  Because of the buoyancy effect, what
24   effect, if any, will the action of the convection
25   airflow have on the hypothetical stratification of
0270
 1   air mixture within the bake chamber.
 2             Since you're constantly circulating that
 3   with the convection fan, how are you going to get
 4   the stratification you've just described?
 5         A.  Well, that will have an effect.  There's
 6   no doubt about it.  But even in spite of the fact
 7   that you're pushing air around, you still can get a
 8   stratification due to the weight.  It's a weight
 9   thing.
10             And I don't -- from what I can tell
11   looking at these things and being inside of it,
12   you're not going to have a uniform convection
13   current everywhere.  And especially in the areas
14   where it's stagnant, you'll get this stratification
15   due to the temperature of gas.
16         Q.  And would it be appropriate to refer to a
17   buoyancy effect, I guess, of the combustion gases
18   having this tendency to rise up to the top part of
19   the bake chamber and force the cool air down low?
20         A.  Definitely.
21         Q.  Okay.  And would you expect, then, those
22   combustion gases at the top of the bake chamber to,
23   I guess, exert a positive pressure with the cooler
24   gases down low likely having a negative pressure in
25   relation to one another?
0271
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
 2             THE WITNESS:  I would think that the
 3   pressure differential is extremely small.  I don't
 4   think you can probably measure it.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Okay.  As you open the bakery door oven,
 7   would the buoyancy effect of the combustion gases
 8   that are already up at the top of the bake chamber
 9   cause them to want to go up and out once you open
10   the door and, likewise, cooler air would be flooding
11   into the bottom of the bake chamber as you open that
12   door?
13         A.  I think when you open the door, it
14   actually creates its own draft.  If I -- if I go
15   into a small room and I slam the door and the
16   windows are closed, you'll find that that door
17   doesn't want to slam, because you're trying to --
18   the door has a large area.  It's like a piston and
19   it will actually affect the airflow in the room.
20             For example, if I go to a closet, open it
21   real fast, I can feel air being moved by the effect
22   of the door.  So when someone opens the door to look
23   inside this oven, the opening of the door itself
24   will actually create a flow of air, and that's hard
25   to quantify that, but it will tend to pull the gases
0272
 1   out into the area where the person is standing.
 2         Q.  Okay.  Have you made any assumptions on
 3   where the person's going to be standing as they're
 4   opening this very large door that you just
 5   described?
 6         A.  They're going to be standing close to the
 7   handle.
 8         Q.  Okay.  Are they going to be standing
 9   behind the door and pulling it open, or are they
10   going to be pulling it open and standing in front of
11   the bake chamber getting hit by these 300-plus
12   degree gases flying out?
13             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,
14   vague and ambiguous, argumentative.
15             THE WITNESS:  Well, I haven't studied it,
16   and I really don't know how they normally open and
17   close the oven door.
18             I wouldn't expect somebody to jump through
19   the crack and jump into a 400-degree oven, that's
20   for sure, but on the other hand, when you open the
21   door and you start mixing the hot air with cold air,
22   I don't know how that affects somebody, how close
23   they want to stay.  It's hard for me to -- I can't
24   calculate that, in other words.

 2         Q.  Was it your decision or the mystery
 3   animators to not include a vent hood in the
 4   animations?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative.
 6             THE WITNESS:  I didn't think about it at
 7   the time and I didn't think it was important enough
 8   to include.  I guess that's the answer to that.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  In Animation 1 -- I think I asked this --
11   do you know what software was used to create the
12   animations?
13         A.  I do not.
14         Q.  All right.  Let's take a look at 5, 5B and
15   5C, which are the analysis of heat tube failure,
16   heater tube failure.  Let me know when you're with
17   me, sir.
18             (Document reviewed by witness.)
19             THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  I was reading.
20   BY MR. CROSS:
21         Q.  Is there anything you want to -- if you
22   want to add anything or clarify anything, please
23   feel free.
24         A.  Well, to answer your last question about
25   including the canopy hood in the animation, one of
0274
 1   the things that I thought augured against that is
 2   that in your specification, it says that the canopy
 3   exhaust is an eight-inch single wall, and it may be
 4   powered by an 800 CFM customer supplied fan, or it
 5   may be keyed into the damper and other -- and
 6   overpressure exhaust.
 7             So, in other words, when I read that, it
 8   looks like it may be this or it may be that, but
 9   they don't really say what it has to be, and so I'm
10   not even sure that it's even operational based on
11   what I'm reading here.
12         Q.  Did you go out and inspect either the
13   Albertsons site where the subject oven was installed
14   or obtain information from anyone about how
15   Albertsons chose to install their oven?
16             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts, argumentative.
17             THE WITNESS:  Well, it's my understanding
18   that the ITW people indicated that it was not
19   required in California to connect that to a fan, but
20   I --
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Well, I understand.  I'm asking if you
23   know how the actual subject oven was set up from
24   either being out there and looking at it yourself
25   or, you know, getting information from somebody else
0275
 1   who did that?
 2         A.  As I sit here, I don't recall whether it
 3   was hooked up or not, the power was hooked up.  But
 4   I remember reading that it -- when whenever you say
 5   may this or may that, it's not very specific.
 6         Q.  Okay.  But the subject oven was installed
 7   in some specific manner; we just don't know what it
 8   is as we sit here?
 9         A.  I don't know what it was, and so I'm
10   basically looking at this as more of a generic
11   analysis, because this is certainly not the only one
12   that failed.
13             Okay.  Now, I'm sorry.  Let's go back to
14   your question to me.  I didn't mean to throw you
15   off.
16         Q.  That's all right.  I appreciate it.
17             I've asked you to look at 5, 5B, and 5C.
18   We're going to talk about your analysis of heater
19   tube failure.
20         A.  5, 5B, and 5C, yeah.  Let's see if I can
21   find those.  That's 8, 7 -- what am I looking for?
22         Q.  You're looking for 5, 5B and 5C, although
23   5B and 5C is just the data that's within.  Here you
24   go (indicating).
25         A.  Okay, good.  5.  All right.
0276
 1         Q.  All right.  So we've got 13 pages of notes
 2   that include various figures and then 5B and 5C,
 3   there are some test data related to the analysis
 4   reflected in Exhibit 5; correct?
 5         A.  There we go.  5C and 5B.  Okay.  I'm on
 6   top of it here.
 7         Q.  So would a fair summary of the opinion
 8   reflected in this work product be that the heat
 9   exchanger failed because metals with different
10   coefficients of thermal expansion were welded
11   together, and that resulted in stress and an
12   ultimate failure of the weld joints?
13         A.  Correct.
14         Q.  All right.  And in your mind, the use of
15   those different materials in this particular
16   application presented a design flow or defect?
17         A.  Yes, it did.
18         Q.  Okay.  You say -- as we -- I'm going to
19   walk through these, but on Page 1, you talk about
20   the combustion gas being forced through the heat
21   exchanger by a fan.
22             And that's the burner motor that we've
23   been talking about?
24         A.  Correct.
25         Q.  All right.  But they're also being pulled
0277
 1   through the tubes with a draft inducer, although you
 2   don't believe it's at a very particularly strong
 3   suction?
 4         A.  I don't believe that by the time you have
 5   a pressure drop through all of these different
 6   passes that you would have any effect, any
 7   pressurizing effect on the heat exchanger.
 8         Q.  All right.  Do you have any particular
 9   expertise in designing draft inducers?
10         A.  Do I have experience?
11         Q.  Yeah.
12         A.  No, I haven't designed one.
13         Q.  Have you had occasion to, I guess,
14   forensically analyze the performance or design of a
15   draft inducer prior to this case?
16         A.  No.
17         Q.  Now, we're walking through this and I
18   think you clarified some of this today, but I want
19   to just make sure, since it's in your report, that
20   I've asked you about it.
21             You say that combustion is not likely to
22   be complete and that's going to result in the
23   generation of carbon monoxide, but am I correct that
24   you've not done any work in this case to quantify
25   the actual levels of carbon monoxide that will be
0278
 1   produced by the subject burner under any specific
 2   conditions?
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  That's something you're referring to
 6   Dr. Romig on?
 7         A.  I'm relying on others for that
 8   information.
 9         Q.  Okay.  And you indicate:
10                 "If there is a breach in the
11             heat exchanger, carbon monoxide
12             is going to be mixed into the
13             oven air and will be inhaled by
14             personnel operating the oven or
15             even working near it."
16             Do you see that language?
17         A.  Yes.
18         Q.  All right.
19         A.  Next to the last paragraph.
20         Q.  We've talked a little bit about the escape
21   of combustion gases when you open the door and dwell
22   times and the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of
23   the vent hood, but you have not done any sort of
24   detailed analysis to opine to a degree of --
25   reasonable degree of engineering certainty that any
0279
 1   individual plaintiff inhaled carbon monoxide from
 2   the subject oven, have you, sir?
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
 4   vague and ambiguous, misstates testimony.
 5             THE WITNESS:  Not any detailed
 6   quantitative analysis.
 7   BY MR. CROSS:
 8         Q.  Okay.  Or even understanding what
 9   plaintiffs were in what areas at what times or how
10   frequently to understand the potential exposure of
11   any individual plaintiff in this case?
12             MR. JARCHI:  It's vague and ambiguous.
13   It's compound, incomplete hypothetical and asked and
14   answered.
15             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, and we have other
16   experts that have been retained on this case that I
17   would defer to.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  And I appreciate that and I think that's
20   consistent with what you told me earlier, but it
21   appears in a document so I want to make sure that
22   it's not -- you know, since it's in your document
23   that it's not a different answer.
24         A.  Let me answer.  The bottom line is I
25   believe that if these combustion products are
0280
 1   introduced into the area where people work, they
 2   will be inhaled.  And so that's all I'm stating
 3   here.  I'm not trying to say that they're going to
 4   be at a level -- of a certain level or how much
 5   damage they would cause or anything else.
 6         Q.  Okay.  And again, I think that's
 7   consistent with what you told me earlier.  I just
 8   want to make sure that it's not something different
 9   since -- the way it reads in the report.
10         A.  Correct.
11         Q.  Moving to Page 2, you've got a single page
12   of handwritten notes that comprises Page 2 of
13   Exhibit 5.
14         A.  I would refer to that as a drawing.
15         Q.  Yes, so it's a sketch of the heat
16   exchanger.
17         A.  May not be the best drawing in the world,
18   but I would call it a drawing.
19         Q.  Well, I will say your calligraphy is far
20   better than mine, so I wouldn't complain about it.
21             I do want to ask you, though, it says up
22   at the top that this sketch was done October 26,
23   2017, and reflects Sheet 2 of 7.
24             Do you know where the other six pages of
25   notes are from October 26, 2017?
0281
 1         A.  Well, they're incorporated in this report,
 2   because when I did the calculations, I did them on
 3   like scratch paper, but I redid them and typed them
 4   so that they would be legible.  So really,
 5   everything that you see here would be something I
 6   copied from the original calculations which I took
 7   that particular drawing from.
 8         Q.  All right.  So in terms of substance,
 9   anything that was captured on those six other pages
10   of handwritten notes you believe is reflected
11   somewhere within the text or calculations that we
12   see in Exhibit 5?
13         A.  Definitely.  I just basically sat down
14   and -- maybe I'm just not smart enough, but I cannot
15   type a report when I'm doing calculations.  I have
16   to do the calculations and go back and type it up,
17   because they're just too many ways -- I guess I'm
18   just not good enough to do it on the fly.
19         Q.  Were the other six pages of handwritten
20   notes discarded at some point?
21         A.  Definitely.  If I don't, I get confused.
22   And so after I type something up and make a report,
23   I found that it's best to throw the other ones away,
24   because sometimes there's two or three pages where
25   I'll scratch things out and say that didn't work out
0282
 1   and try this and try that until I get something that
 2   works.  So, yes, those are not -- not fit to be
 3   presented to anybody.
 4         Q.  All right.  So there were likely changes
 5   or corrections or other revisions to the initial
 6   calculations that were done in handwriting that led
 7   to --
 8         A.  Correct.
 9         Q.  -- what we finally see as the final
10   calculations and information presented in Exhibit 5?
11         A.  Correct.
12         Q.  Do you know whether you had considered any
13   different analytical approaches, or were they simply
14   corrections to the same, same approach?
15         A.  No.  As far as I know, there's only -- I
16   would only know how to do this one way.
17         Q.  Okay.
18         A.  And this is the way I did it.
19         Q.  And what we see in Exhibit 5 is the
20   culmination and the end product after you've gone
21   through and made sure that you've dotted the I's and
22   crossed the T's, so to speak.
23             All right.  The next page is Figure 2, and
24   that's the PowerPoint that you created of the gases
25   flowing through the heat exchanger.  I think we've
0283
 1   talked about that enough.
 2         A.  Correct.
 3         Q.  So let's move to Page 4.  And you talk
 4   about the design flaw again, and you indicate:
 5                 "The tube is welded to the
 6             flat plate that forms the
 7             surface of the box structure
 8             using a fillet weld."
 9             And I just want to ask you:  Do you know
10   whether that's a fillet weld or a groove weld?
11         A.  You could call it a -- you could call it
12   each, either, I think.
13         Q.  What's the difference between the two?
14         A.  Well, a fillet weld is when you have two
15   things -- normally two things joining at a right
16   angle, and then you put a weld in there.  I
17   recognize that these don't exactly join at a right
18   angle, but it's a triangular weld.
19             A groove weld is typically more of a
20   square weld.  So I tended to call it a fillet weld.
21   But I'm not hard.  If you want to call it a groove
22   weld, that's fine with me.
23         Q.  It is what it is and we know the welds
24   that we're talking about.
25         A.  Exactly.
0284
 1         Q.  All right.  And you indicate that the weld
 2   failed at some point during the service life of the
 3   oven and allowed combustion gases to escape.  And
 4   here you say into the atmosphere inside the bakery
 5   rather than being exhausted out the flue duct.
 6             Do you see that language?
 7         A.  Which page are you on?
 8         Q.  I'm still on Page 4.  And you say:
 9                  "This joint failed in
10             service, allowing gases from the
11             combustion chamber to escape
12             into the atmosphere inside the
13             bakery instead of going out
14             through the exhaust duct."
15         A.  Yeah.  That's probably not a very well --
16   or a good way of stating it.
17         Q.  Well, would it be more accurate to say
18   that it escaped from the heat exchanger into the
19   convection flow that would allow it into the bake
20   chamber of the oven?
21         A.  Yeah, and then eventually out into the
22   bakery.  Yes.
23         Q.  Okay.  And then it's going to escape --
24         A.  Ultimately, it does go into the bakery.
25   So --
0285
 1         Q.  So it's going to go into the bakery when
 2   you open the door?
 3         A.  Correct, that's basically the idea.
 4         Q.  Do you believe it's going to escape into
 5   the bakery through the seals of the door, given that
 6   we think that there's probably equal pressure to
 7   atmosphere inside the bake chamber?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered and
 9   misstates the testimony.
10             THE WITNESS:  I think some of it could go
11   out through the cracks in the door, but the majority
12   of it would come out when you open the door.
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  All right.  Do you believe that all of the
15   combustion gases are going to escape into the
16   convection flow and enter the bake chamber when you
17   have a breach, or will some of those combustion
18   gases continue through the heat exchanger and exit
19   through the flue?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Can you read it back?  Too
21   fast for me.
22             THE WITNESS:  You --
23             MR. JARCHI:  I'm asking for the question
24   to be read back to me.
25   ///
0286
 1             (The record was read as follows:
 2             Q.   All right.  Do you believe
 3             that all of the combustion gases
 4             are going to escape into the
 5             convection flow and enter the
 6             bake chamber when you have a
 7             breach, or will some of those
 8             combustion gases continue
 9             through the heat exchanger and
10             exit through the flue?)
11             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,
12   vague and ambiguous.
13             THE WITNESS:  There will be some of the
14   combustion products that would probably go on up
15   through the heat exchanger.  I won't argue that.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  All right.  Have you made any effort to
18   quantify what percentage is going to exit through
19   the flue versus what percentage is going to enter
20   the convection flow and enter the bank chamber?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous as to
22   "quantify," incomplete hypothetical.
23             THE WITNESS:  I have not made that
24   calculation.  It would depend on the relative back
25   pressure.  Gas will always go to the easiest area,
0287
 1   the least resistance, like everybody else.
 2             And so, basically, if it's less pressure,
 3   it drops and goes through the failed heat exchanger
 4   than it is to go up the stack, then more of it will
 5   go in the bake chamber.
 6             And quite honestly, initially, when you
 7   start having hairline cracks, I would say most of it
 8   goes up the stack, but whenever you start seeing a
 9   whole tube eaten away like this, I think more of it
10   goes into the bake chamber.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  All right.  In terms of the analysis --
13   well, I'll come back.
14             If you turn to the next page, Page 5, you
15   talk about the designer understanding that materials
16   had different thermal expansion properties.
17             Are you following along with me?
18         A.  Give me a hint where you are there.
19         Q.  Yeah.  You're down about halfway on the
20   second paragraph on Page 5.  It says, "It would
21   appear that the designer was cognizant of the fact
22   that there's a significant difference in the thermal
23   expansion properties of the materials.
24             Can you see that language?
25         A.  Yes.
0288
 1         Q.  And the basis for your assumption that the
 2   designer was aware of the thermal expansion
 3   properties was essentially use of an expansion joint
 4   on the fire tube?
 5         A.  Let me just read the whole thing here.
 6         Q.  Yeah.
 7         A.    "Presumably, the purpose of
 8             the expansion joint is to allow
 9             the carbon steel tubes to expand
10             lengthwise independently of the
11             stainless steel fire tube."
12             Yeah, and that's -- from that picture, you
13   can see that here we have a stainless steel fire
14   tube and we have carbon steel tubes, and they both
15   connected top and bottom.
16             If you didn't have an expansion joint in
17   the fire tube, you would be forcing them to have the
18   same relative deflection, okay, relative same
19   deflection, and that would put a bending load on the
20   box, so that they put an expansion joint there to
21   allow the carbon steel tubes to expand more than the
22   stainless steel, and that allows the -- prevents an
23   axial stress from developing due to the difference
24   in expansion.
25             That's -- that was just -- I looked at
0289
 1   that and said, "Why did they put an expansion joint
 2   in there," and that's because you're tying carbon
 3   steel and stainless steel of the same length, so
 4   they figured that out.
 5         Q.  Have you seen any documents or testimony
 6   to confirm that assumption that that's what purpose
 7   the expansion joint was intended to serve?
 8         A.  I didn't.  I just looked and said that
 9   makes sense to me as an engineer.  I would do that
10   same thing if I was trying to design this.
11         Q.  Is there any other purpose the expansion
12   joint might serve, other than the one you've assumed
13   and explained?
14         A.  The only other reason I could think it
15   would be there would be the combustion tube gets
16   hotter than the other tubes, so that would
17   compensate for that also.
18         Q.  Okay.  It might isolate the heat transfer
19   from the fire tube getting into the front box and
20   the other tubes?
21         A.  It wouldn't isolate the heat transfer.
22   The expansion joint won't do anything for heat
23   transfer.  It will -- it will allow that tube, the
24   big -- how big is that diameter, 12 1/2 inch
25   diameter tube.  It will allow that to expand and
0290
 1   contract with respect to the tube in the stainless
 2   steel box and the carbon steel box.
 3         Q.  Do you know what the construction of the
 4   expansion joint is, what materials are used?
 5         A.  I don't know.  I didn't measure that when
 6   I was at the site.
 7         Q.  Do you know why it might be wrapped in a
 8   fibrous ceramic material that would be suitable for
 9   insulation?
10         A.  Well, I would assume because it gets hot.
11         Q.  All right.  And then you go on to say that
12   despite the apparent cognition of the different
13   thermal expansion, it does not look like the
14   designer appreciated or understood that the weld
15   joints would experience high stress due to the use
16   of different materials.
17             Was that your conclusion?
18         A.  I'm sorry.  Where are you reading that?
19         Q.  Yeah.  We went through that.  Right after
20   you talk about the designer being cognizant of the
21   fact that there are different coefficients of
22   thermal expansion between stainless steel and carbon
23   steel, you say that:
24                  "The designer did not
25             understand that the weld joint
0291
 1             between the carbon steel tubes
 2             and the stainless steel box
 3             would result in high
 4             discontinuity stresses when the
 5             temperature of the heat
 6             exchanger was increased."
 7             Was that your opinion?
 8         A.  That was my opinion, yes.
 9         Q.  Okay.  And that's -- and the weld joint
10   between the aluminized carbon steel tubes and the
11   stainless steel box, that is in fact where the
12   subject heat exchanger failed; true?
13         A.  That's right.
14         Q.  And that's something you believe that the
15   designer reasonably should have known but did not?
16         A.  Yes.  I think that was an error in the
17   design process.
18         Q.  Okay.  You go on to describe a fatigue
19   process with stress on the weld caused by cyclical
20   heating and cooling leads to an eventual crack and
21   then the crack is exacerbated by the flue gases that
22   are escaping through it until you get a complete
23   breach over time.
24             Did I understand that language correctly?
25         A.  That's my understanding.  That's what I
0292
 1   think happened, yes.
 2         Q.  Okay.  And you've talked about that a
 3   little bit a couple times today.  You used the term
 4   "low cycle fatigue" and you referenced that I think
 5   one other time earlier today and you said the low
 6   cycle fatigue is being caused by the cyclical
 7   stresses imposed on the weld.
 8             How are you using the term "low circle
 9   fatigue"?
10         A.  If you look at a fatigue curve for any of
11   these materials, what you find is that it's usually
12   a logarithmic curve and you have a vertical axis
13   which is alternating stress.  You have a horizontal
14   axis which is logarithm of the number of cycles.
15             And if you have low cycle fatigue, you
16   will find that you'll start to develop a crack
17   within a few hundred cycles, usually, and that high
18   cycle fatigue can take you all the way out to a
19   million cycles without cracking.
20             So the curve is -- again, it's a
21   logarithmic curve that starts of high stress because
22   you can take a -- for a few cycles, you can take a
23   high stress cycle, but if you want it to last a
24   hundred thousand cycles, you got to reduce that
25   alternating stress cycle.  If you want it to last
0293
 1   forever, you've got to have a very low alternating
 2   stress, and that's the nature of fatigue curves.
 3             And so anything that fails in the very
 4   early stages after a few hundred cycles, say, that
 5   would be a low cycle fatigue.
 6         Q.  All right.  But you haven't attempted to
 7   quantify and put a specific number of cycles on the
 8   failure for this particular design; rather, it's the
 9   idea that the stress is imposed by each cycle and
10   above the ultimate yield strengths, so you would not
11   expect it to last into the high cycle range?
12         A.  It won't last long, because each time you
13   heat it up and cool it down, you are inducing a
14   large strain.
15             And it turns out that fatigue is actually
16   more driven by strain than it is stress, and when
17   you're doing fatigue tests to determine how long a
18   metal will last, you typically use a strain test
19   rather than a stress test, except for very high
20   cycle like in an aircraft design.
21         Q.  Okay.  And then we get back into this idea
22   of the back pressure and the gas escaping once you
23   have a breach of the heat exchanger, but, again,
24   this ignores any effect or any potential effect by
25   the draft inducer, based on your analysis that the
0294
 1   draft inducer would not have an appreciable effect?
 2         A.  That's my opinion.
 3         Q.  Okay.  And did you do any testing
 4   whatsoever to substantiate your hypothesis that a
 5   back pressure would exist in the heat exchanger
 6   while the burner was firing?
 7         A.  Only --
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 9   incomplete hypothetical.  I'm sorry.
10             THE WITNESS:  You've been so quiet over
11   there, Rob, I --
12             MR. JARCHI:  Sorry.  Object to form.
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  So is that a theoretical analysis but you
15   haven't tested that?
16         A.  I have not tested it, no.
17         Q.  All right.  The last thing obviously I
18   want to ask you about is this suggestion that there
19   is your opinion that there's a flame that existed at
20   the gap when the carbon monoxide in the burner gas
21   has reached a combustible air-fuel ratio and that
22   would explain explosions in the oven.
23             First, are you talking about there being
24   alleged explosions in the subject oven?
25         A.  No.
0295
 1         Q.  You're talking about other ovens or puffs
 2   or pops or whatever Dr. Mills was referring to?
 3         A.  Well, there's actually been, I'll say,
 4   half a dozen explosions where they actually did
 5   severe damage to the door and blow out glass and
 6   stuff like that.  So there have been some pretty
 7   severe explosions which I saw in some of the
 8   documents that I read.
 9         Q.  And have you seen -- and the explosions
10   are in fact what the pressure switches were
11   identified -- or were created to try and address;
12   right?
13         A.  That was one of their reasons.
14   Apparently, they were thinking that they were
15   running gas into the ovens without the fan blowing
16   and creating a large amount of accumulated gas which
17   was actually going into the bake chamber itself, and
18   when it got ignited, it was causing explosions,
19   yeah.
20         Q.  All right.  And have you analyzed any of
21   the individual incidents you've identified to
22   determine whether that was not in fact what was
23   happening in those vents?
24             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
25   incomplete hypothetical, compound.
0296
 1             THE WITNESS:  I did not have the
 2   opportunity to analyze those cases because I don't
 3   have all the detail.  I do remember a particularly
 4   detailed report that was produced by Mills, and it
 5   was in regard to the explosion in Japan, if I
 6   remember correctly, and I believe even Dr. Mills had
 7   trouble identifying the cause of that explosion, but
 8   we know it was pretty severe.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Okay.  What would the source of the flame
11   at the gap in the heat exchanger be?  I mean are you
12   talking about the flame getting out of the
13   combustion chamber and getting to the breach of the
14   heat exchanger, or what's the flame at that gap?
15         A.  Well, again, I don't have any experimental
16   data to back it up, but I looked at the damage that
17   was done by the -- in the Albertsons heat exchanger,
18   and it looked like to me that end of those tubes had
19   been exposed to actual flames, just based on my
20   experience.  They were oxidized in a way, they were
21   curled in a way, and they appeared actually to have
22   lost a considerable amount of the metal.  Completely
23   lost.  It was somewhere in an oxidized way.
24             So that was to me consistent with a flame
25   impingement.
0297
 1         Q.  Okay.  Now, you said you haven't done any
 2   testing of that theory.
 3             Have you done any calculus -- or
 4   calculations or theoretical analysis to determine
 5   how the flame would get from the burner to that spot
 6   or how any other mechanism that a flame would be
 7   propagated to that location?
 8         A.  The only thing that I would consider is
 9   that there was enough excess fuel so that the flame
10   and the burner was actually filling not only just
11   the combustion chamber, but it could have been a
12   flame all the way down to where this breach in the
13   tubes was.
14             But again, that was just a -- my own
15   thinking based on the amount of damage that was done
16   to the tubes.  It looked like to me they were
17   exposed to flames.
18         Q.  Okay.  So you haven't done testing or
19   theoretical analysis to see whether it would be
20   possible for the flame to get to that point; it's
21   rather based on your assessment of the ends of the
22   failed tubes?
23         A.  That's correct.
24             MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  Compound,
25   argumentative, incomplete hypothetical, misstates
0298
 1   the testimony.
 2             THE WITNESS:  My -- my opinion was based
 3   on the appearance of the ends of the tubes,
 4   primarily.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Have you discussed with Mr. Hendrickson
 7   your belief that there was an actual flame impinging
 8   on the ends of those tubes?
 9         A.  No, I have not.
10         Q.  All right.  Let's go on to your
11   calculations that start on Page 9.  Well, actually,
12   they start on page -- the bottom of Page 6, but I
13   think my first questions are on Page 9 for you.
14         A.  Okay.
15         Q.  So on Page 9 you show a bending stress on
16   the carbon steel tubes at a thousand degrees that
17   you calculated to be 79,295 PSI; true?
18         A.  Correct.
19         Q.  And you report the ultimate stress limit
20   for the carbon steel is 25,900 PSI; right?
21         A.  Correct.
22         Q.  Is the 25,900 PSI the ultimate stress
23   limit with the carbon steel tension or compression?
24         A.  It depends on which side you're looking
25   at.  When you take a tube and you bend it like that,
0299
 1   you will have a tensile side and a compression side.
 2         Q.  And it is your belief the ultimate stress
 3   is the same for carbon steel whether it's under
 4   tension or compression?
 5         A.  It's generally close.
 6         Q.  Okay.  Do you have any -- what source did
 7   you use to determine that the ultimate stress for
 8   carbon steel was 25,900 PSI at a thousand degrees
 9   Fahrenheit?
10         A.  The curves that you show in 5B.
11         Q.  Okay.  So you used the curves that are
12   attached on 5B?
13         A.  Let's see here.  That's -- I'm sorry.  5B
14   is by just elasticity.
15         Q.  Second page of 5B?
16         A.  Second page is strength.  This is the
17   ultimate strength.
18         Q.  Okay.  And the source of this graph of the
19   strength of the metals was engineeringtoolbox.com?
20         A.  Correct, on the Internet.
21         Q.  Okay.  And essentially, the outcome of
22   that calculation and that reference is that the
23   thermal stress in the carbon tube is going to be
24   more than three times the ultimate stress limit at a
25   thousand degrees; is that right?
0300
 1         A.  That's what I calculated, yes.
 2         Q.  Okay.  Why wouldn't the carbon steel tube,
 3   each and every carbon steel tube that's attached to
 4   stainless steel, then crack and deform after a
 5   single cycle?
 6         A.  Because they're ductile.  Carbon steel,
 7   especially at that temperature, is very ductile.
 8   It's just like you can take a paper clip and I can
 9   bend it double, and if I calculated the stress, that
10   would be well above ultimate.  But it doesn't break.
11   As a matter of fact, you would have to sit there and
12   work it for a long time before you would actually
13   break it.
14             And that's the same mechanism here.  The
15   ductility of the material at that temperature allows
16   it to strain, but it doesn't overstress it.  It
17   won't break.
18         Q.  Okay.  Is that the same explanation you
19   would give for why you wouldn't get a failure at
20   every single cycle with the hoop stress being in
21   excess of the ultimate strength?
22         A.  Sure.  We look at a car after it's in an
23   accident.  It's bent.  The stresses are way above
24   yield if you calculate it using linear elastic
25   methods, but they don't usually break because
0301
 1   they're not brittle.
 2         Q.  Okay.  And that's why you don't end up
 3   with a longitudinal split down the carbon steel pipe
 4   every single time you cycle it?
 5         A.  Right.
 6         Q.  You also on Page 10 calculate something
 7   called the stress intensity, and it looks like you
 8   basically combine the calculated bending and hoop
 9   stress values.  And you talk about that concept
10   being intended to reflect the maximum difference in
11   principal stress components.
12             Do you see that language?
13         A.  Yes.
14         Q.  Is it your opinion and testimony that
15   calculating the bending stress and the hoop stress
16   is the same as calculating the principal stresses?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
18             THE WITNESS:  Excuse me.  You wanted to
19   say something?
20             MR. JARCHI:  I just objected; vague and
21   ambiguous.
22             THE WITNESS:  Oh.  It turns that in this
23   case it is, because there aren't any shear stresses.
24   The magnitude of shear stress is very small.
25             So the two components, you have a bending
0302
 1   stress, which is in the axial direction, and you
 2   have a hoop stress, which is in the circumferential
 3   direction, and the absence of sheer stress, which I
 4   ignored.  Those are the principal stresses.  And
 5   since one of them is in tension and one is in
 6   bending, the stress intensity is the summation of
 7   those two stresses, the absolute value of the
 8   summation.
 9         Q.  Okay.  I think this goes back to the
10   question I had, though.
11             So the stress intensity on the inner
12   radius you have shown as 114,694, and that would be
13   with the carbon steel, and you note that that's four
14   and a half times the ultimate strength of 20 --
15   almost 26,000, or the 25,900 we talked about?
16         A.  Right.
17         Q.  So the four and a half times stress
18   intensity -- I'm sorry.  With the stress intensity
19   being four and a half times the ultimate stress for
20   carbon steel is premised on this idea that the
21   25,900 ultimate strength for carbon steel applies
22   both in tension and compression?
23         A.  No.
24             MR. JARCHI:  Compound, incomplete
25   hypothetical, vague.
0303
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Well, the carbon steel is in compression
 3   on the inner radius, is it not?
 4             MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  That's what you kind of indicated in the
 7   paragraph up above there.
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Same objections.
 9             THE WITNESS:  I haven't looked at these
10   for a while.  But it doesn't matter, because once
11   you exceed the ultimate stress, you're just
12   developing strain.  And so every time you cycle it
13   you're yielding it, and at that point it's just a
14   matter of time until you start growing a crack in
15   the bridges.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  So you get all these calculations talking
18   about stress and the magnitude of stress over
19   ultimate strength and all that, but what I'm hearing
20   you say is once you yield it, really, strain is a
21   lot more important than the stress numbers, just
22   like the --
23         A.  Paper clip situation.
24         Q.  Paper clip situation.
25         A.  Yeah.
0304
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates -- vague and
 2   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
 3             THE WITNESS:  But when you have that big
 4   of an excursion of stress at those temperatures,
 5   you're eventually going to develop a crack.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  Okay.  I am being told that we have one
 8   minute left, so let me ask you one last question.
 9             On Page 12, we go to your Finite Element
10   Analysis, and as with the modeling stuff we talked
11   about earlier, would you agree that finite element
12   analysis is going to be subject to the garbage-in
13   garbage-out phenomenon?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
15   vague and ambiguous.
16             THE WITNESS:  Well --
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  If you have improper assumptions, you get
19   incorrect results?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  Argumentative,
21   vague and ambiguous, compound.
22             THE WITNESS:  If you don't do it right you
23   will get the wrong answer.  That's for sure.
24             MR. CROSS:  All right.  Let's take a break
25   and change the tape.
0305
 1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  The
 2   time is 5:13 p.m.
 3             (Whereupon, a recess was held
 4             from 5:13 p.m. to 5:31 p.m.)
 5             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the
 6   beginning of Media Number 4 in the videotaped
 7   deposition of Dr. James Williams Jones.  Going back
 8   on the record.  The time is 5:31 p.m.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  All right, sir, we're in the home stretch
11   here.
12             I do want to direct you back to Page 13 of
13   Exhibit 5.  We had just started talking about your
14   FEA analysis of the weld joint on the heat
15   exchanger.
16         A.  Okay.
17         Q.  And does Figure 6 reflect the condition
18   that you analyzed through your FEA modeling?
19         A.  Figure 6 is the results of -- of the heat
20   up cycle for the FEA model, yeah.
21         Q.  Okay.  And as I'm looking at this, is this
22   reflecting the stresses and temperatures involved
23   with a single combustion tube interfacing with the
24   stainless steel flat -- flat box plate?
25             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
0306
 1   misstates the evidence.
 2             THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.  The left-hand
 3   side would be like the centerline of the tube, and
 4   then the green horizontal piece would represent the
 5   plate.
 6   BY MR. CROSS:
 7         Q.  Okay.  The heat exchanger actually
 8   comprises three rows of four tubes each joined to
 9   the stainless steel lower box, similar to what we
10   see in Figure 1 and 2; right?
11         A.  Correct.
12         Q.  Did you consider any additional
13   constraints on the movement and stresses that might
14   be imposed by this more complex structure as opposed
15   to the interaction between a single tube and plate
16   interaction?
17             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
18   incomplete hypothetical.
19             THE WITNESS:  I don't believe there would
20   be any.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Okay.  Earlier when we were discussing
23   your work with Solar Turbine, you talked about you
24   can't isolate one piece; the whole thing operates as
25   a unit.
0307
 1             Why would the heat exchanger with the
 2   multiple tubes in not have some effect on each other
 3   in terms of their thermodynamic -- their stresses
 4   and expansions?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates testimony,
 6   compound, argumentative, vague and ambiguous,
 7   incomplete hypothetical.
 8             THE WITNESS:  Well, the answer is very
 9   simply that if you go back to Page 2, my sketch of
10   the stainless steel box, these -- these tubes are
11   all welded into a flat plate.  That would be the top
12   of the carbon steel box -- I'm sorry -- the top of
13   the stainless steel box that you see I've got marked
14   24 inches wide.
15             When that stainless steel box is heated,
16   it will expand uniformly in all directions, okay?
17   And it will -- and when a flat plate expands, it is
18   very stiff.  Let's see if I can demonstrate.
19             The bottom line is that a cylinder like
20   this is much weaker in the radial direction than a
21   plate is in the in-plane direction.  So therefore,
22   whatever the plate does it will force the cylinder
23   to do.
24             So if the hole will expand or contract,
25   since it's in a flat plate, that flat plate is much
0308
 1   stiffer than a cylinder with a load in it.
 2             So therefore, you can isolate these tubes.
 3   There will be very little interaction between the
 4   tubes.  And so I only analyzed the one tube.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  Now, the radial displacement that you're
 7   talking about is the flat plate being stiffer, and
 8   you think that would isolate the effect of one tube
 9   from another.
10             Am I right, though, that the plate is not
11   just going to expand elastically without being
12   affected by the stiffness of at least the individual
13   tube that you're analyzing?
14         A.  That's true, and this analysis takes that
15   into consideration.
16         Q.  Okay.  So how is the stiffness of the tube
17   taken into consideration when the inputs that you
18   were talking about were just the -- the differences
19   in the thermal expansion coefficients?
20         A.  Just by heating up the whole thing.  You
21   build a model and if you just increase the
22   temperature of every -- of all the pieces, then when
23   one has a differential motion compared to the other,
24   that causes the stress.
25         Q.  I understand it's going to cause the
0309
 1   stress, but wouldn't the resistance of the tube to
 2   expanding at the same rate as the steel plate affect
 3   the rate at which the steel plate is expanding?
 4   It's going to resist that pull?
 5         A.  Sure, and that's reflected in the
 6   analysis.
 7         Q.  Okay.  Where is that reflected in the
 8   analysis?
 9         A.  Because we start off with the steel --
10   with the tube, a model of the tube, a model of the
11   plate, and all we do is increase the temperature of
12   these pieces.  I think I used a thousand degrees or
13   something, Delta T, and whenever that plate wants to
14   expand, the hole gets bigger, and the tube, the
15   stainless -- or the carbon steel tube doesn't want
16   to get bigger as fast, so the stainless steel pulls
17   it out, okay?
18         Q.  Okay.  So the inherent strength or
19   resistance of the carbon steel tube to being pulled
20   is factored into your finite element analysis and
21   calculations?
22         A.  Yeah, and that's essentially what I did by
23   hand.
24         Q.  Okay.
25         A.  I started off on Page 6, for example, and
0310
 1   I just made the assumption that the plate's much
 2   stronger than -- if I expand the plate, it will pull
 3   the tube out with it, and I calculate the
 4   differential motion and that gives me the stress in
 5   the tube.
 6         Q.  Okay.  And that's the use of the Roark
 7   solution?
 8         A.  Exactly.  And I think I came out with
 9   80,000, 79,259, and whenever I ran it through the
10   stress, I got 80,000.
11         Q.  Well, I understand your finite element
12   analysis matches up with your calculations, but
13   they're based on the same assumptions; right?
14             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
15             THE WITNESS:  Not really.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  Okay.
18         A.  Not really.
19         Q.  Okay.  What are the differences in
20   assumptions between your hand calculations and
21   you're finite element analysis modeling?
22         A.  When I did the hand calculations, I didn't
23   take into account the relatively -- relative
24   flexibility of the plate.  I assumed that the plate
25   was much stronger than the tube.
0311
 1         Q.  Okay.
 2         A.  And I calculated the deflection of the
 3   plate, the hole of the plate, and I applied that
 4   deflection to the tube.  So I did not take into
 5   account the fact that the tube will pull the plate
 6   back a little bit.  And my assumption was, based on
 7   doing this for a long, long time, that the stiffness
 8   of the plate is much greater than the stiffness of
 9   the tube.
10         Q.  Okay.
11         A.  So I could ignore the stiffness of the
12   plate and just apply all that load to the tube.
13         Q.  Okay.  And that's what we were kind of
14   talking about, the tube pulling back on the plate
15   and not letting it expand as fast as it wants.
16             That's something that was ignored in the
17   hand calculations but is accounted for in the finite
18   element analysis?
19         A.  Oh, yeah.
20             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Is that what you just told me?
23             MR. JARCHI:  You got to give me a second
24   to object.
25             THE WITNESS:  Sorry.
0312
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 2   compound, incomplete hypothetical, form.
 3   BY MR. CROSS:
 4         Q.  Isn't that what you just explained to me,
 5   sir?
 6         A.  Yes.  The finite element --
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.
 8             You have to give me a second.
 9             THE WITNESS:  The finite element solution
10   takes into account the stiffness of both members --
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  Okay.
13         A.  -- whereas, my hand calculation only takes
14   into account the stiffness of the tube.
15             But my assumption was that the plate is so
16   much stiffer, it wouldn't matter, and when I ran the
17   analysis, it turns out it was almost identical.
18         Q.  All right.  And I understand your
19   assumption based on your theoretical analysis that
20   the interactions at one tube plate juncture would
21   likely be isolated from the effects of the other
22   tube plate junctures.
23             Did you do any full modeling of the entire
24   structure, or was everything limited to the single
25   tube plate interaction?
0313
 1         A.  I just looked at a single tube.
 2         Q.  Okay.  We talked earlier about the
 3   ductility and plastic deformation ideas and why you
 4   could exceed ultimate strength without, you know,
 5   having these things just bust apart.
 6             Did you account for the ductility of the
 7   individual materials either in your hand
 8   calculations or in the finite element analysis
 9   modeling?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
11   incomplete hypothetical, compound.
12             THE WITNESS:  In the -- in my analysis, I
13   did a linear elastic analysis.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Right.
16         A.  But the point was to see what the stresses
17   would be, assuming they didn't yield.  But what I'm
18   finding is that they do yield.
19         Q.  Okay.
20         A.  And so, therefore, you will have more
21   strain, but you won't have -- you won't actually be
22   able to develop that level of stress.
23         Q.  Okay.  And so within the hand
24   calculations, you did not account for the plastic
25   deformation or the ductility and you just had a
0314
 1   linear analysis with the elastic stresses and
 2   continuing with -- without that consideration?
 3         A.  That's -- that's correct.
 4         Q.  Did you take into account plastic
 5   deformation within your finite element analysis
 6   modeling?
 7         A.  No.  I only did linear elastic analysis so
 8   I could compare it with my hand calculations.
 9         Q.  Okay.  And because you did them out of the
10   same assumptions, you got pretty close to the same
11   answer.
12             So your math is right?
13         A.  Well, I've been doing -- for years when I
14   had my business, every job we did, the people that
15   worked for me would go off and do the FEA and I
16   would do the hand calculations, and I was always
17   within 10 percent of what they got after three
18   months of work.  That was my job, is to check their
19   work, and I did it.  And that's just typical, the
20   way it works.
21         Q.  And I think the last thing you indicated,
22   though, one of your findings is that because of this
23   plastic deformation that was not accounted for in
24   your calculations or in your FEA, really, strain
25   becomes the more important driving factor rather
0315
 1   than the stresses that you've analyzed at some
 2   length?
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Misstates the testimony.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  Isn't that what you just told me, sir?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection; vague and
 7   ambiguous.
 8             THE WITNESS:  It's the strain range that
 9   causes low cycle fatigue.
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  All right.  Let's move on, then, and talk
12   about the combustion pressure calculations that
13   we've marked as Exhibit 7.
14             First off, can you tell me generally what
15   you're trying to show through these calculations?
16         A.  The -- one of the things that occurred to
17   me was that if we're just comparing the pressure
18   that's developed by the burner fan and looking at
19   pressure drop through the heat exchanger, we're not
20   really looking at the right conditions.
21         Q.  Okay.
22         A.  When you are -- when you first start up
23   the fan, there's no flame, and so you get a fairly
24   small pressure drop through the heat exchanger
25   because you have low flow.  You don't have a lot of
0316
 1   volume of air going through the heat exchanger.
 2             When you have low flow, your pressure
 3   drops pretty small, and you don't see the
 4   resistance.  The pressure drop is related to low
 5   velocity.
 6             In other words, the more air you try to
 7   push through a given hole, the more pressure it
 8   takes to do it, as you can -- I mean it doesn't take
 9   a genius to figure that out.
10             So I wanted to get a feeling for how much
11   the pressure would increase whenever we kicked on
12   the burner, okay?
13         Q.  Okay.
14         A.  And so when you first start up the blower,
15   you just have ambient air going into the blower.
16             Now, at some point, after you've left it
17   on for 34 seconds or whatever, theoretically, you
18   have cleaned out all of the combustion products
19   through the heat exchanger and all the way up the
20   duct, maybe, and now you kick on the flame.  You try
21   to light this.  You turn on the gas.  You get your
22   igniter, and all of a sudden you get a flame.
23             You're putting 318,000 BTUs in this thing.
24   That's a lot of energy, okay?  That energy has to go
25   someplace; right?  And where it goes is in expanding
0317
 1   the gas.  The amount of gas volume compared to the
 2   amount of air volume is pretty low so that you
 3   can -- for a first order of assumption, you can just
 4   assume that the air you have coming in is going to
 5   be converted to hot gas, so that now we get an
 6   expansion of that hot gas.  The gas will expand, and
 7   it expands a lot between ambient, which may be 70
 8   degrees feeder air, and all of a sudden, that gas is
 9   heated up to 1200 degrees or something like that.
10             And I looked up the methane plane
11   temperature.  It's 3452.  Of course, we won't get
12   that hot a gas because we're mixing air with it and
13   it's not going to be complete combustion.
14             So there's a lot of reasons we don't see
15   3452, but we will see a fairly high temperature.
16   And we know that we have exhaust gases coming out up
17   to 500 degrees, and that's after you've taken the
18   heat out of that gas with your heat exchanger.
19         Q.  Okay.
20         A.  So I'm saying let's just assume that the
21   gas heats up, and I -- for a first cut, I said,
22   "Let's assume it goes up to the max of 1600," which
23   I believe Mills says is kind of an upper limit on
24   his use of stainless steel.
25         Q.  Okay.
0318
 1         A.  So if that's what he's saying is the
 2   maximum, I'll start out with that in number.
 3             So the next thing I do there is say,
 4   "Okay, what happens to the gas whenever heated up
 5   for an ambient to 1600."  Well, it expands, and it
 6   expands a lot, okay?
 7         Q.  Okay.
 8         A.  And, you know, you've experienced that if
 9   you, you know, have a balloon or whatever.  Whenever
10   it gets hot or cold, it changes its size.  This is
11   really expanding the gas.
12             On the other hand, whenever this gas
13   expands and I'm trying to push it through there,
14   it's got to have a higher velocity.  Because I've
15   got X number of cubic feet of gas going through the
16   same area, it's got to go through there faster.
17   Well, the faster it goes through there, the higher
18   the pressure.
19             So when I put it under pressure, it
20   actually gets smaller again, so I got two things
21   competing.  The heating expands the gas, but if I
22   increase the pressure, it compresses the gas.  So
23   it's not a simple problem to figure out.
24             So what I did was to go through there, and
25   I used these basic equations of fluid flow.  One is
0319
 1   mass continuity, M dot.  That's the mass flow rate.
 2   Row V1a1 is equal to Row 2 V2a2 on Page 1, and I
 3   know what the initial density of the gas is, .074
 4   pounds per cubic feet, and that gives me a starting
 5   point.
 6             Now, and then I -- I look up the density
 7   of air, and that's on the last page, air density in
 8   pounds per cubic feet, at different temperatures.
 9             And so I applied it for different
10   temperatures and different pressures.  So you can
11   see from this, if you look carefully, you'll see
12   that the density varies with the pressure in terms
13   of atmosphere; in other words, if I double the
14   pressure, the density goes -- goes up by a factor of
15   2.  If I triple the pressure, and that's one of the
16   basic laws of physics, Boyle's Law or Charles Law or
17   somebody's law.  So if it's a law, it's got to be
18   right.
19             So now I have the situation where I
20   have -- I've got an idea of how much more volume
21   I've got to push through there.
22         Q.  Okay.
23         A.  That tells me I can calculate the new
24   velocities.  And then I also know that the higher
25   the velocity, I'm going to get a pressure increase
0320
 1   because I've got to push harder to get the gas to go
 2   through.
 3             So now higher pressure compresses the gas,
 4   and I'll have a tradeoff, and so I want to use these
 5   equations to determine what that tradeoff is, and
 6   that's what I've done here.  I used those equations
 7   and I used something called Bernoulli's law.
 8   Bernoulli's law says that the rho v squared over
 9   2g -- that's velocity squared -- plus the pressure,
10   plus the head, is equal to a constant.
11             So what it tells me is I can trade off
12   static pressure for kinetic energy, and so then I
13   used that equation, combined that with my other
14   pressure ratio equations, and I find out that after
15   I go through this that the pressure will be the
16   ratio -- will increase by the ratio of the two
17   velocities, the velocity before I pressurize --
18   before I burn it, and then the pressure with the
19   velocity after the combustor turns off.
20             And the whole point of doing this is to
21   find out whenever I hit the -- turn on the gas and I
22   start blowing hot air through this thing, am I going
23   have a higher pressure at this failed area than I
24   would before, and it turns out it's a linear
25   relationship with the velocity.
0321
 1             So, yes, the answer is I will have a much
 2   higher pressure at those failed tubes when I'm
 3   burning it than I will whenever I don't have
 4   combustion going on.
 5         Q.  Okay.  And how does that factor in to your
 6   opinions about the -- I guess the effects of the
 7   breach in the heat exchanger?
 8         A.  Okay.  One of the questions that's come up
 9   is here we have a situation where we hit -- we hit
10   the burner so the gas comes on, and now we're
11   running hot gas through there.
12             The pressure at those breached areas will
13   be much higher than it would be if I was just
14   running ambient air through there.
15             So now I'm going to force air into the
16   bake chamber, and that pressure is significantly
17   higher, so I will increase the pressure in the bake
18   chamber because I'm forcing a lot of the combustion
19   products into the bake chamber and they're going in
20   at a much higher pressure.
21             So now I'll see an increase in pressure in
22   the bake chamber, okay, and I will also double up
23   more combustion products into the bake chamber,
24   okay?
25         Q.  All right.  So you -- go ahead.
0322
 1         A.  And now, all of a sudden, the oven says I
 2   don't need any more heat for a while.  It turns off.
 3   After some number of seconds, the electricity to
 4   the -- to the burner is turned off, the fan stops.
 5   But now we still are pulling air through the duct,
 6   okay?  We've got our duct fan up there pulling air.
 7             But -- but when that happens, you have
 8   much lower pressure at the breached area, okay?  So
 9   you may be getting air in there, but it's not going
10   to be pumping as much fresh air into the bake
11   chamber as you were pumping in whenever you were
12   burning, when you had the burner on.  And that's
13   what I'm trying to figure out.
14             So it turns out that due to my calculations
15   and in my opinions here, when you hit the burner
16   sort of like an afterburner on a jet engine, all of
17   a sudden you get a lot more pressure, the combustion
18   products are going to be forced into the bake
19   chamber.  You will actually see an increase inside
20   the bake chamber of pressure, okay, because it can't
21   escape out of the vent now fast enough.  And so
22   we -- and so we will see leakage and whatever.  And
23   now when we turn off, the pressure drops.  That's my
24   conclusion.
25         Q.  Okay.  Let's go through some of this.  I
0323
 1   thought we had gone through some of this before, but
 2   let's go through it again.
 3             So the gist is that when you turn on the
 4   burner, you heat up the gases, and so you're going
 5   to increase the pressure of the combustion gases as
 6   they're going through the heat exchanger --
 7         A.  No, first of all, you increase the
 8   velocity.
 9         Q.  Right, the velocity.
10         A.  And when you start trying to force more
11   mass through the same area, you're going to have
12   more pressure.
13         Q.  So you're going to make it more likely for
14   the combustion gases to leave the heat exchanger
15   through the breach because they're coming through at
16   a higher pressure?
17         A.  You will have higher pressure there,
18   especially right there where the burner is.
19         Q.  Okay.  You're going to enter the
20   convection flow but you have not really analyzed
21   what the effect of the convection flow through the
22   bake chamber is, as we discussed earlier.
23         A.  The whole --
24             MR. JARCHI:  Let him finish the question
25   before you begin to answer so I can object.  I'm
0324
 1   sorry.  Is there a question pending?  I might have
 2   interrupted you.
 3             THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.
 4   BY MR. CROSS:
 5         Q.  Yeah.  So we've got the combustion gases
 6   that are being pushed out of the breach by this
 7   higher pressure that you've just identified for us
 8   from the hot gases.
 9         A.  Correct.
10         Q.  They're going to enter the convection flow
11   at that point; true?
12         A.  They're going to enter -- they're going to
13   go out of the heat exchanger and into the bake
14   chamber.
15         Q.  Directly, or are they going to enter the
16   convection flow caused by the convection -- or by
17   the convection fan?
18             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
19   assumes facts.
20             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  They will enter the
21   convection flow, but they will -- there will be a
22   significant amount of gas now being introduced that
23   wasn't there before.
24   BY MR. CROSS:
25         Q.  I understand.
0325
 1             You said earlier today you have not done
 2   any kind of analysis or modeling of the convection
 3   flow itself to see how much of the combustion gases
 4   that are flowing into the combustion chamber -- or
 5   into the bake chamber are staying and how much is
 6   being drawn back through -- in the flow of the
 7   convection flow.
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates --
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Have you modeled or analyzed that pathway?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; misstates the
12   testimony, compound as to "modeled" versus
13   "analyzed," incomplete hypothetical, argumentative,
14   vague.
15             MR. CROSS:  Did it misstate the prior
16   testimony or this new testimony?
17             MR. JARCHI:  I'm not going to respond to
18   that, but go ahead.
19             THE WITNESS:  To answer your question, the
20   convection flow just circulates air inside of the
21   bake chamber.
22   BY MR. CROSS:
23         Q.  Right.
24         A.  So it doesn't bring in new air or it
25   doesn't exit air; it's just basically making air
0326
 1   circulate.
 2             The breach in the heat exchanger fed by
 3   this high pressure combustion flow, now it begins to
 4   introduce a considerable amount of new air that --
 5   new air, that combustion air, into the bake chamber,
 6   okay?  And it's got to go someplace, and the only
 7   place that it can get out is through the vent, and
 8   it's coming in fast enough so that you will see an
 9   increase in pressure inside of the bake chamber
10   caused by the combustion air flowing into -- through
11   these breached tubes.  That's my -- that's my
12   opinion.
13         Q.  Okay.  And I think I want to follow up,
14   then.
15         A.  Sure.
16         Q.  Is it your opinion that, absent a
17   deflagration or the injection of something like
18   steam, you're going to get appreciably more than one
19   atmosphere of pressure in the bake chamber, given
20   the presence of the overpressure vent that we talked
21   about at some length earlier today?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
23   assumes facts, incomplete hypothetical, misstates
24   the testimony.
25             THE WITNESS:  This is a condition that
0327
 1   exacerbates the pressure inside of the bake chamber
 2   because you have the overpressure right at the
 3   breach and you're driving combustion products into
 4   the bake chamber faster than they can be vented.
 5   BY MR. CROSS:
 6         Q.  What testing or analysis have you done as
 7   to the efficiency of the overpressure of that to
 8   suggest that you're going to get a higher than
 9   atmospheric pressure in the bake chamber under any
10   condition, other than steam or a deflagration event?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
12   misstates the testimony, incomplete hypothetical,
13   vague as to modeling or empirical evidence or
14   whatever it is you said, analysis, and incomplete
15   hypothetical.
16             THE WITNESS:  I just -- based on my
17   calculations, the pressure will increase
18   considerably, and you have a huge area of -- to flow
19   into the bake chamber, and you're basically pumping
20   high pressure air into the bake chamber.
21   BY MR. CROSS:
22         Q.  Sir, did you tell me under oath earlier
23   today that you would believe -- that you believe,
24   it's your opinion, that the pressure in the bake
25   chamber would be pretty close to atmospheric unless
0328
 1   you have an event like steam being introduced or a
 2   detonation of deflagration, an explosion, you called
 3   it.
 4             Isn't that what you told me earlier today?
 5             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
 6   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical, misstates the
 7   testimony.
 8             THE WITNESS:  My understanding of your
 9   question was that under normal conditions and even
10   under where you had small cracks in these tubes,
11   what you're saying is right, and I believe that is
12   the case.
13             But when you have the situation where you
14   have a serious breach of these tubes, we have
15   something similar to a steam event or the
16   deflagration of the explosion -- I'm going to call
17   it that -- it is a similar event, and it will
18   overload the vent.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  Have you done any modeling using your
21   assumption of the density and the flow rate of the
22   gases to demonstrate what would happen in the bake
23   chamber, given the volume in the bake chamber and
24   the characteristics of the overpressure vent?
25             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
0329
 1   ambiguous as to "modeling," incomplete hypothetical.
 2             THE WITNESS:  My reason for believing this
 3   is based on my calculations and testimony of people
 4   who work around these ovens.  They've seen gases
 5   coming out, they felt gases coming out around the
 6   door, and I believe that that's caused by this --
 7   this physical phenomenon.
 8   BY MR. CROSS:
 9         Q.  Point me to any testimony that talks about
10   gases coming out through the door as opposed to
11   steam.
12             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; asked and
13   answered.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  Any testimony.
16             MR. JARCHI:  Objection --
17   BY MR. CROSS:
18         Q.  You've got the thing cited in your design
19   notes; right, for all the important testimony.
20             Point me to any testimony where somebody
21   said, "Gases were escaping as opposed to steam."
22             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; asked and answered
23   previously.
24             THE WITNESS:  I believe that Julie Lee
25   said that in her deposition.
0330
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  How did Julie know that there were gases
 3   escaping the door?
 4         A.  Well, she said she could feel them coming
 5   out.  That's my recollection.
 6         Q.  Anybody besides Ms. Lee?
 7         A.  As I sit here today, I don't recall that,
 8   but when reading the depositions, that I -- that was
 9   my impression.
10         Q.  Okay.  Am I right that as a scientist and
11   as an engineer, you have not gone in and attempted
12   to replicate this condition you're talking about now
13   with this overpressurizing of the bake chamber
14   through some breach of the heat exchanger?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; argumentative,
16   misstates the testimony, asked and answered,
17   misstates the prior testimony.
18             THE WITNESS:  I have not done that.
19             But another -- another thing that caused
20   me to believe that that was true is, if I can --- I
21   can't remember the date of it, but there was an
22   engineering change order where -- I believe this was
23   during the inspection -- they took out the -- there
24   was a damper in that overflow vent, and that was to
25   allow the gases to go out faster.
0331
 1   BY MR. CROSS:
 2         Q.  Okay.
 3         A.  So obviously, they had situations where
 4   that wasn't working.  It wasn't relieving the
 5   pressure.
 6         Q.  You're talking about gas -- or you mean
 7   steam?
 8         A.  Could be steam.
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, vague and
10   ambiguous --
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  But you just told me --
13             MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  I've got to put the
14   objections on the record so I just need you to wait
15   a second before you answer.
16             Argumentative, vague and ambiguous,
17   incomplete hypothetical, compound.
18   BY MR. CROSS:
19         Q.  You referenced a specific engineering
20   change order.
21             Did the change order talk about gases,
22   restriction of gases or restriction of steam?
23             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
24   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
25             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't recall the
0332
 1   details of it.  I can find it if you want me to.
 2   BY MR. CROSS:
 3         Q.  Given the objections that are being placed
 4   and the time constraints we have, I think we'll just
 5   keep -- it says what it says.
 6         A.  Okay.
 7         Q.  Is it your recollection that Ms. Lee
 8   testified that she felt gas or air or that the door
 9   was hot?
10             MR. JARCHI:  Assumes facts that it's not
11   both.
12   BY MR. CROSS:
13         Q.  What's your recollection of the testimony,
14   sir?
15         A.  I know she said that she thought the door
16   was hot, and if that's the case, it's probably
17   because gas was coming out and heating the door.
18         Q.  So did she say there was gas coming out
19   and she felt that, or just that the door was hot?
20             MR. JARCHI:  Asked and answered.
21             THE WITNESS:  It was my recollection that
22   she could feel gas coming out.
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  So just to clarify some things you said
25   earlier, is pressure directly proportional to
0333
 1   velocity or inversely proportional to velocity of
 2   gas?
 3         A.  The higher the velocity, the higher the
 4   pressure, linearly.
 5         Q.  All right.  So it's directly proportional?
 6         A.  Correct.
 7         Q.  All right.  Let me go through your
 8   assumptions here.
 9             The initial assumption of 1600 degrees
10   Fahrenheit for the gases, you said that was based, I
11   think you said, on Dr. Mills' testimony about the
12   maximum use for stainless steel?
13         A.  Correct.
14         Q.  You indicate in here in your notes on
15   Page 2 of Exhibit 7 that that use of 1600 was
16   consistent with metallurgical findings for the
17   failed tubes.
18         A.  Yes.
19         Q.  What were the metallurgical findings?
20         A.  Oh, let's see.  Where are we, 2 of 5?  I
21   don't know.
22             Oh.  I believe our metallurgist said that
23   there are certain base transformations that occur at
24   that temperature, and I think that he said that the
25   temperatures were in that range, best of my
0334
 1   recollection.
 2         Q.  So is it based on things Mr. Hendrickson
 3   said or something Dr. Mills said?
 4             Mr. JARCHI:  Assumes it's not both.
 5   Argumentative, compound.
 6             THE WITNESS:  Yeah, the bottom line is
 7   that I used 1600.  I could have used 1400; I could
 8   have used 1300, 1500.
 9             I'm trying -- in this particular paper,
10   I'm trying to show that as you increase the amount
11   of the energy that you're putting in there, you have
12   to increase the velocity that will cause pressure
13   increases through the heat exchanger, and you will
14   blow in a lot more gases into the bake chamber.
15   That's the point of this.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  So are these numbers real, or is this
18   again basically a qualitative analysis where you're
19   using some quantitative data that may or may not
20   reflect what's happening in the oven?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
22   ambiguous, assumes facts, misstates the testimony.
23             THE WITNESS:  These numbers are real.  If
24   I'm going from 70 to 1600, this is what I'm going to
25   get.  If I'm going from 70 to 1500, I'll get a
0335
 1   slightly different number.
 2   BY MR. CROSS:
 3         Q.  Okay.  And by real, I mean what's
 4   happening with the subject oven as opposed to what
 5   you might be assuming.
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; asked and
 7   answered.
 8             THE WITNESS:  I believe my numbers are
 9   representative of what happened in the actual oven.
10   BY MR. CROSS:
11         Q.  All right.  You talked about a stagnation
12   pressure, and I'm wondering:  Is that the same as a
13   static pressure?
14         A.  No.
15         Q.  Okay.  What's a stagnation pressure?
16         A.  If you have air and you're blowing it
17   against a flat surface like we are here, the air
18   will be moving along at a given velocity.  All of a
19   sudden, when it hits the wall, it has to stop, okay?
20             And I can use Bernoulli's equation, as I
21   did down here on Page 2, to calculate what the
22   pressure would be when I have no velocity, and that
23   is the stagnation pressure.
24         Q.  Okay.  So that's the pressure at the point
25   where the velocity of the gas drops to zero?
0336
 1         A.  Correct, before it turns around and goes
 2   the other way.
 3         Q.  And by looking at the gas at the
 4   stagnation pressure, you simply -- you're able to
 5   calculate the comparative pressure relationship
 6   because you eliminate the velocity pressure?
 7         A.  I know that at the point where these tubes
 8   are failed, you're essentially at zero velocity,
 9   because the air has to stop going to the left and go
10   back to the right.  So it has no velocity, or very
11   little velocity.
12         Q.  Okay.  And by eliminating the velocity
13   pressure, you can make a direct comparison of the
14   pressure between the two gases?
15         A.  Exactly.
16         Q.  Okay.  This idea of the higher pressure
17   heated gases flooding the bake chamber with a volume
18   that's going to overwhelm the overpressure vent, is
19   that impacted at all on the size of the breaches in
20   the heat exchanger, the gaps that are present?
21         A.  Of course.  The bigger the gaps get, the
22   more pressure.  The more gas you'll be pumping into
23   the bake chamber, the more overloaded you'll get and
24   you'll start to see a pressure increase.
25         Q.  All right.  Have you accounted for the
0337
 1   gaps anywhere in the hypothetical that you gave me
 2   that the difference in pressure would result in the
 3   bake chamber actually becoming overpressurized?
 4         A.  I'm sorry.  I don't understand the
 5   question.
 6         Q.  Yeah.  I guess it goes back to what I
 7   asked you earlier:  Have you done any kind of
 8   volumetric analysis to see how much combustion gas
 9   would be pushed into the combustion chamber under
10   any set of conditions?
11         A.  Not at this time.
12         Q.  All right.  Let's move on and talk about
13   your vent hood calculations that we've marked as
14   Exhibit 7 (sic).
15             MR. JARCHI:  For the record, the vent hood
16   calculations, were they marked as Exhibit 8?
17             MR. CROSS:  Yes, I'm sorry.  Exhibit 8,
18   not Exhibit 7.  Thank you.
19   BY MR. CROSS:
20         Q.  So in terms of the vent hood calculations,
21   we tried to determine the effectiveness or
22   ineffectiveness of the vent hood in capturing flue
23   gas after the door of the oven is opened?
24         A.  Correct.
25         Q.  All right.  And is it your opinion that
0338
 1   the vent hood is going to be effective at capturing
 2   any percentage of the gas mixture escaping the
 3   chamber when the door is opened?
 4         A.  Well, first of all, I'm assuming there's a
 5   fan there.
 6         Q.  Okay.
 7         A.  But I'm not -- I'm not sure there was.
 8   I'd have to go back and read deposition testimony to
 9   make sure there was a fan there.  We could actually --
10   according to the thing I read you earlier, it's
11   optional.
12         Q.  Okay.
13         A.  -- and I --
14         Q.  Go ahead.
15         A.  I seem to remember that McGee or somebody
16   said that it's not required in California, whatever.
17         Q.  Okay.
18         A.  But assuming -- assuming -- even assuming
19   there's a fan there -- if there's not a fan there,
20   then it changes -- there's nothing but a vent and a
21   stack.  But let's assume there's a fan there.
22         Q.  Okay.
23         A.  What I did was to say -- it says in the
24   best situation, we have 800 cubic feet per minute,
25   the fan pulling up on the stack; right?
0339
 1         Q.  Why do you say the best situation?
 2         A.  That's what they say, as to the owner may
 3   provide an 800 cubic -- a fan that draws 800 cubic
 4   feet per minute.
 5         Q.  Do you know if the owner can provide a fan
 6   that provides greater cubic feet per minute
 7   extraction?
 8         A.  Well, it wasn't recommended.
 9         Q.  Okay.
10         A.  I've never known anybody that supercharged
11   a vent hood yet.  And if it's recommended by the
12   manufacturer, I wouldn't think anybody would go
13   over --
14         Q.  Okay.
15         A.  -- over horsepower.  But, anyway --
16         Q.  Do you know if Albertsons had a fan
17   attached to the vent hood, and if so, what its
18   capacity was?
19         A.  You know, my memory is just a little vague
20   on that.  I seem to remember they did not have a fan
21   there, but I can't swear to it, and I'm expected to
22   swear to it here.
23         Q.  All right.  So your assumptions or your
24   calculations were made under the assumption that
25   there was an 800 CFM fan attached to the vent hood;
0340
 1   is that right?
 2         A.  Correct.
 3         Q.  Okay.  Now, the section you calculated,
 4   did you essentially use an average of the velocity
 5   into the hood, taking into account the entire area
 6   of the ventilation hood?
 7         A.  I did.  I assumed it was 20 inches
 8   overhang, and I used 60 inches long --
 9         Q.  Okay.
10         A.  -- the inches that I pulled off your
11   sketches or drawings, best that I could determine.
12         Q.  Okay.  Now, you've got it drawn and you're
13   showing that the vent -- the hypothetical 800 CFM
14   fan is actually somewhere in the middle, and it's an
15   8-inch diameter fan; is that right?
16         A.  That's the way it looked to me on the
17   drawing.
18         Q.  Okay.  Rather than an average suction
19   across the entire vent hood, wouldn't the suction be
20   much higher directly underneath the fan pipe than at
21   the outside edges of the vent hood?
22             MR. JARCHI:  Argumentative, incomplete
23   hypothetical.
24             THE WITNESS:  It depends on how deep the
25   hood is and how -- but it's possible that you have a
0341
 1   local cone of area that's got higher velocities.
 2   BY MR. CROSS:
 3         Q.  How deep is the hood?
 4         A.  Huh?
 5         Q.  How deep is the hood?
 6         A.  20 inches.  Oh, how deep is it?
 7         Q.  Yeah.
 8         A.  I don't have a number for that, but it
 9   doesn't matter on my calculations.
10         Q.  Have you done any testing of a connected
11   vent hood to an 800 CFM fan to see if there is a
12   localized cone of suction?
13         A.  Yes -- no, I haven't done any testing, but
14   one thing I can tell you is that the hood as
15   designed, in my opinion, is pretty much worthless.
16         Q.  I know you're telling me that, but I'm
17   trying to find out what the basis for that opinion
18   is.
19         A.  Well, there's a couple of bases.
20             First of all, you have a very low amount
21   of air that you're moving through the vent and in
22   the best conditions.
23             Secondly, I've designed -- I've designed
24   hoods before, and I don't think this hood design
25   is -- from an engineering standpoint, it appears to
0342
 1   be very poor.
 2             It looks like to me from all I can figure
 3   in the ones that I've seen that it's open underneath
 4   the hood.
 5             The way you design a hood is that you have
 6   a fan causing a draft.  Then you put a flat plate
 7   inside the hood that only has about an inch gap all
 8   the way around.  And by doing that, you increase the
 9   velocity around the edges of the hood to what we
10   call the capture velocity.  So all the fumes that
11   would come up under the hood would be sucked into
12   the hood because they couldn't get out without
13   passing through the capture velocity.
14             If you have a hood that just has a big
15   opening up there with no plate in it to increase the
16   airflow at the periphery, you don't capture very
17   much of the fumes, they'll go around there, because
18   the average flow velocity is 1.6 feet per second,
19   which is about one mile per hour.  I walk three
20   miles an hour, at least, so that's about a third of
21   the walking speed.
22         Q.  So the 1.6 feet per second or 1.09 mile
23   per hour, that's basically what you're drawing with
24   the suction from the fan itself; right?
25         A.  Over the whole area of the vent, yes.
0343
 1         Q.  Okay.  Have you taken into account at all
 2   the escape velocity of the gas, that high pressure
 3   gas that's at the top of the oven as you open the
 4   door?
 5         A.  I don't know what you mean by the "escape
 6   velocity."
 7         Q.  Well, when you open the door, am I correct
 8   that the hot gases at the top of the bake chamber
 9   are going to want to move outward and upward?
10         A.  Yeah, all of the gas is in the bake
11   chamber, not along the top ones, but they'll all
12   want to move outward and upward.
13             When you open the door, you will cause a
14   partial vacuum, and that will pull the gases out
15   into the bake area around the oven.
16         Q.  Okay.  Have you calculated how fast the
17   gases are going to be exiting the oven because of
18   either the suction you're creating or the vacuum
19   you're creating when you pull the door open, or just
20   their natural tendency to go out and up?
21         A.  I have not calculated that, no.
22         Q.  Okay.  Wouldn't that be additive to the
23   suction of the fan in terms of what goes into the
24   exhaust and what doesn't?
25         A.  Not necessarily.  It could bypass the fan
0344
 1   altogether.  The fan suction is so low that you're
 2   not going to get much help out of the air velocity.
 3         Q.  Okay.  If you have an 800 cubic foot per
 4   minute fan, what's that mean in terms of the amount
 5   of air that's being removed by that fan?
 6         A.  800 cubic feet every minute.
 7             So what I did was to calculate how much
 8   for that given area, 1 foot deep, what would be --
 9   how long would it take to evacuate that, and that
10   gives you that for every foot, it would take that
11   long to pull up that much air.
12         Q.  What's the volume of the bake chamber?
13         A.  I forget.  It's pretty big.  It's about
14   5 by 4 by 6.
15         Q.  About 150 cubic feet?
16         A.  Yeah, I would say 150 cubic, a reasonable
17   number might be.
18         Q.  All right.  What's your basis for assuming
19   a linear gradient for the escape of the gas from
20   the -- the gas mixture from the bake chamber once
21   the door is opened?
22         A.  Well, I know the velocity at the top
23   because I calculated it.  I know the velocity at the
24   bottom is zero, because you can't get any flow in
25   that direction, and so I just assumed linear.
0345
 1         Q.  What's the basis for assuming it's linear
 2   as opposed to some other relationship?
 3         A.  Just based on experience, it's a
 4   reasonable assumption.
 5         Q.  Does that reflect reality for a door
 6   plume, or gases escaping when you open a door?
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 8   incomplete hypothetical.
 9             THE WITNESS:  In my opinion, it would,
10   yes.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  Is there any technical literature or other
13   scientific basis you can draw me to, other than your
14   experience?
15         A.  I have not looked at that.
16         Q.  How would you go about testing the actual
17   flow path and velocities --
18         A.  Excuse me.
19         Q.  -- of gas escaping the oven when you open
20   the door?
21             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
22   ambiguous, incomplete hypothetical.
23   BY MR. CROSS:
24         Q.  If you wanted to test your hypothesis, how
25   would you go about doing it?
0346
 1             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection; assumes
 2   facts.
 3             THE WITNESS:  I would probably utilize
 4   some kind of a visualization where I would use a
 5   smoke or carbon, some kind of a guise or something.
 6   Probably wouldn't be a good idea.  You'd want it to
 7   be the right temperature, but you'd want to
 8   visualize it.  And I think that you'd have to just
 9   basically take some videos, saw how it mixes with
10   the air, that sort of thing.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  So you could do something like a smoke
13   bomb test.
14             Are there any special cameras out there
15   that can actually measure temperature?
16         A.  Yeah.  They have, you know, temperature
17   sensitive cameras.  The problem with a camera like
18   that is you don't know what depth your measuring;
19   whereas, with smoke, you can get a three-dimensional
20   visualization with a camera, infrared camera, say.
21   I think it would be difficult to determine where
22   you're measuring.
23         Q.  All right.
24         A.  And there's other ways to do it.  You
25   could put spikes out there with ribbons on them and
0347
 1   all kind of things just to get a feel for the flow,
 2   but it's pretty hard to measure velocity, that low
 3   of velocity.
 4             MR. CROSS:  All right, sir.  I need to
 5   take a quick comfort break, but we are absolutely
 6   going to finish it up when I get back.  If we can
 7   just take two minutes.
 8             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  The
 9   time is 6:24 p.m.
10             (Whereupon, a recess was held
11             from 6:24 p.m. to 6:34 p.m.)
12             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the
13   record.  The time is 6:34 p.m.
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  All right, sir.  Just wrapping up on a
16   couple of things here with your hood calculations
17   that we've marked as Exhibit 8.  I want to make sure
18   I understand one thing.
19             One of the critiques you had about the
20   design of the ventilation hood was essentially that
21   it was a 20-inch by 60-inch mass and there were no
22   plates or anything.  You called it a plate or a
23   one-inch something or other.
24         A.  Generally speaking, if you're designing a
25   hood like I used to do for the steel businesses in
0348
 1   Pittsburgh and stuff, you want to create a high
 2   airflow around the periphery and generate capture
 3   velocity so that as the fumes work their way out, it
 4   will suck them up under the hood.
 5         Q.  And it's your understanding that the hood
 6   doesn't have any sort of obstruction or mass
 7   underneath the -- I guess to create that capture
 8   velocity.
 9         A.  I didn't --
10             MR. JARCHI:  Hold on.  Vague and ambiguous.
11             THE WITNESS:  I didn't see it.  I looked
12   at one, a typical -- Baxter or somebody over at
13   Panera, and it appeared that it did not have that.
14             My kitchen hood doesn't have it either.
15   It's just kind of a trapezoidal shaped hood and it's
16   all open.
17         Q.  Did you look at the design drawings for
18   the hood for the subject oven?
19         A.  I actually tried to.  I'm not sure -- I
20   couldn't find any kind of a bottom plate that would
21   have done that, so I didn't see it.
22         Q.  Okay.  Did you look at the design drawings
23   for the subject hood and did not see one, did not
24   see a --
25         A.  I looked at the design drawings for the
0349
 1   whole oven and I didn't see one.
 2         Q.  Okay.  The other thing I wanted to ask you
 3   about is your assumption in terms of the flow of the
 4   gas and, essentially, the velocity stopping when the
 5   gas gets to the stainless steel box, velocity
 6   dropping to zero, and that's what drove the
 7   pressure, yeah, the stagnation pressure we're
 8   talking about.
 9         A.  Oh, okay.  That's the other calculation.
10         Q.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.
11         A.  No, that's okay.
12         Q.  It's getting late.
13             So the stagnation pressure, we're looking
14   at Exhibit 7.
15         A.  Yeah, what happened to that.  Yeah, that
16   must be it right there.  Nope.  Let me try again.
17   That must be it right there.
18             Yes, sir.  Okay.
19         Q.  All right.  Now, the stagnation pressure
20   assumption that you talked about, it's basically the
21   gas coming in, it has to stop when it gets to the
22   back wall of the box, and then so it's essentially --
23   the velocity of the gas is still at zero when it
24   gets to the opening where the breach between the
25   tube and the box is; is that accurate?
0350
 1         A.  Yes, sir.
 2         Q.  All right.
 3         A.  I've got a sketch on Page 3 where I'm
 4   trying to depict that.
 5         Q.  Okay.  And my question is:  Does the gas
 6   come to a stop and then reverse itself, or is it
 7   more like, you know, bouncing off the wall?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Vague and ambiguous,
 9   incomplete hypothetical.
10             THE WITNESS:  Well, gas doesn't bounce,
11   but -- and it will have to come to -- let me just
12   say, all of the velocity in the horizontal
13   direction, looking at my Page 3 of 5 figure --
14   BY MR. CROSS:
15         Q.  This is on Exhibit 7.
16         A.  Exactly.  And all of the velocity in the
17   horizontal direction, it has to come to a complete
18   stop at the wall.  Now it has to turn.  It will
19   turn, but you see, the flow area of the box is a lot
20   bigger than the flow area of the tube.
21             So that velocity as it turns will be very
22   low, and so you'll still have a higher pressure.
23   That's what's driving it into the tube going the
24   other way and accelerating down the other side.
25             The other side will hit another wall and
0351
 1   be sucked into the tube up there and back and forth.
 2   That's what I'm assuming.
 3         Q.  What's the reduced velocity as the gas
 4   enters the opening where the breach is, as opposed
 5   to the zero that it is at the wall?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  Incomplete hypothetical,
 7   vague.
 8             THE WITNESS:  Oh, you're saying -- yeah,
 9   there's a hole here.  It will be forced out into
10   there, because you have a lower pressure out in
11   there, and so it will accelerate through the hole in
12   the tube at that point.
13   BY MR. CROSS:
14         Q.  Okay.  And that really is my question;
15   you're assuming this stagnation pressure, but
16   that -- that zero pressure -- or that zero velocity
17   is really at the back wall.  It's got to start
18   moving again to go through the hole?
19         A.  Correct.
20         Q.  And you indicated that's going to be a
21   lower velocity than the incoming gas, but have you
22   calculated what that velocity actually will be as
23   the gas exits the hole and out the breach?
24         A.  I have not.  I haven't done a fluid flow
25   analysis of that.
0352
 1         Q.  All right.  We're -- all right.
 2             Sir, we don't have a whole lot of time, so
 3   I'm going to ask you some general questions about
 4   Exhibit 6, which is your design notes.
 5         A.  Okay.  Let me see if I can find those.
 6   They may be in the pile here.  That may be it right
 7   there.  Oh, here they are.
 8         Q.  All right.  You've gone through and laid
 9   out some opinions that you intend to express with
10   regard to the design of this heat exchanger and
11   you've gone through and cited various sources that
12   you believe support the various opinions you've
13   identified.
14             Is that an accurate description of this
15   document?
16         A.  Yes, sir.
17         Q.  All right.  One of the gentlemen you cite
18   to quite often is Dr. Mills, and that's Nigel Mills
19   you referenced earlier?
20         A.  Yes, sir.
21         Q.  Do you know whether Dr. Mills participated
22   in the original design of this oven or of the heat
23   exchanger for this oven?
24         A.  It's my experience -- it's my recollection
25   that he did not.  He was brought on board after they
0353
 1   were already using this design.
 2         Q.  All right.  You also -- you reference a
 3   Mr. Wilson here on Point 2.
 4             Do you recall what part, or what
 5   responsibilities for the company Mr. Wilson had?
 6         A.  Yes.  Charles Wilson reported to Michael,
 7   Michael Gumbert, and in his deposition I think he
 8   referred to himself as his right-hand man.  He
 9   tended to do a lot of the -- from what I can
10   remember, a lot of the paperwork.  He was sort of
11   like the guy that did a lot of the -- what do you
12   call it -- clerical duties.  So he tended to be in
13   the -- very knowledgeable about what was going on in
14   that group.
15         Q.  What's your understanding of Mr. Gumbert's
16   responsibilities with the company?
17         A.  Gumbert was the manager of the -- of the
18   support group.  And actually, he seemed to have a
19   very large role in the company, to me.  He had a
20   number of people working for him, and he was
21   responsible for making sure that the service
22   department was providing support for all of their
23   2500 ovens out in the field.  He seemed like a very
24   nice -- a good guy.
25         Q.  You understood he was in the service end,
0354
 1   though; he was wasn't a designer?
 2         A.  Oh, correct.  He was in the service
 3   business.
 4         Q.  All right.  You cited a couple of times to
 5   some issues with a manufacturing supplier called
 6   FarWest?
 7         A.  Correct.
 8         Q.  Do you know whether FarWest had anything
 9   to do with the heat exchanger that was in the
10   subject oven?
11         A.  My understanding, that they didn't make
12   these ovens.  They came on board afterwards.
13         Q.  Okay.
14         A.  These ovens were made in their Canadian
15   plant.  The heat exchangers were.
16         Q.  Okay.  Now, you talked about the design
17   hierarchy in a number of different places and sort
18   of this idea of eliminating hazards or guarding
19   against them or warning.
20             Are you familiar with that reference?
21         A.  Yes, sir.
22         Q.  All right.  Is it your belief that that
23   methodology is applicable to every identifiable
24   hazard for a given product?
25         A.  It's applicable to every identifiable
0355
 1   hazard.  Is it applied to every identifiable hazard?
 2   That's a different question.
 3         Q.  Is there any product that you cannot
 4   identify a hazard, an existing hazard?
 5         A.  Well, there are probably hazards out there
 6   that you haven't thought of, but if you do a risk
 7   assessment of a product, you should be able to
 8   identify most all of the probable hazards that it
 9   would see in its lifetime.
10         Q.  All right.  And the point of a risk
11   assessment is not only to consider the hazard, but
12   the likelihood of it occurring and the consequence
13   of it occurring; right?
14         A.  That's basically what a risk assessment
15   does.
16         Q.  All right.  Because a hazard can be
17   anything that can hurt you?
18         A.  Sure.
19         Q.  All right.  Is there a hazard to allowing
20   automobiles to travel faster than 5 miles per hour?
21         A.  There's a hazard to allowing them if they
22   go over 5 miles an hour.  There's also a hazard for
23   them 5 miles an hour or less.  It all depends on how
24   you look at it.
25         Q.  Is it possible to put a governor on the
0356
 1   vehicles or enforce cars to require smaller engines
 2   so the vehicle is not capable of going more than
 3   5 miles an hour?
 4         A.  It's possible.
 5         Q.  Okay.  You wouldn't mandate that that's
 6   required under the design hierarchy to address that
 7   hazard, though, would you?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Speaks to a fundamental
 9   misunderstanding of the word "hierarchy," incomplete
10   hypothetical.
11   BY MR. CROSS:
12         Q.  I agree there's some fundamental
13   misunderstanding of when that's applied, but...
14         A.  No, there's also a risk benefit analysis
15   that has to be applied to these things.
16         Q.  Okay.  Would you agree with the concept
17   that the design hierarchy should be followed to
18   eliminate any hazard that it creates an unreasonable
19   risk of harm from a product?
20         A.  Well, I think the design hierarchy should
21   be followed for all products.
22         Q.  I agree it's for all products.  I'm
23   talking about the type of risk or harm or hazard
24   posed by the product.
25             You apply the design hazard -- you apply
0357
 1   the design hierarchy to get the product to where
 2   it's reasonably safe?
 3             MR. JARCHI:  Objection.  It's
 4   argumentative and misstates.  It's vague, too.
 5             THE WITNESS:  Your question -- in your
 6   question you use the term "reasonably safe."
 7   That's -- that's where you have a subjective
 8   decision to make.  And you also mentioned the term
 9   "consequence."
10             In the case of risk and this design
11   hierarchy, consequence is probably the most
12   important.
13             Even if it's a low risk, a low probability
14   of it occurring, if it's a high enough consequence,
15   you have to consider it in your design, and
16   certainly a death due to carbon monoxide poisoning
17   is possible.  Certainly should be considered in the
18   design hierarchy, in my opinion.
19         Q.  Do you know whether any of the plaintiffs
20   died due to exposure to carbon monoxide?
21         A.  It's my understanding they haven't died
22   yet.
23         Q.  Do you know whether -- well, you've
24   already indicated you're not going to be talking
25   about the expected health risk posed by various
0358
 1   levels of carbon monoxide intoxication; correct?
 2         A.  That's outside of my expertise.
 3         Q.  All right.  You did indicate that there's
 4   an understanding that a -- a balancing needs to be
 5   applied on design decisions as well as general
 6   acknowledgment of the design hierarchy; correct?
 7             MR. JARCHI:  Objection; vague and
 8   ambiguous, misstates the testimony.
 9   BY MR. CROSS:
10         Q.  Isn't that what you told me, sir?
11             MR. JARCHI:  Same objection.
12             THE WITNESS:  Well, there's always a
13   balance.  You -- as you said, I wouldn't want to
14   reduce the speed of cars to 5 miles an hour to
15   prevent any injuries or deaths.
16   BY MR. CROSS:
17         Q.  You've got to make sure that the consumers
18   can afford what you're offering, that it's providing
19   utility, and you've got to look at things like
20   durability and serviceability and a whole host of
21   costs when coming up with design decisions; isn't
22   that true?
23             MR. JARCHI:  Compound; vague and ambiguous
24   and incomplete hypothetical.
25             THE WITNESS:  All of those factors are
0359
 1   considered in your risk assessment, yes.
 2             MR. CROSS:  All right.  You know, sir, I
 3   think I may be done.  Let me take a quick look at my
 4   notes just because I think we're down to the last
 5   few minutes here and I appreciate your time today.
 6             THE WITNESS:  Sure.
 7             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Do you want to go off
 8   record or --
 9             MR. CROSS:  Yeah, let's go off record just
10   for a quick minute.
11             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record.
12   The time is 6:50 p.m.

15             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going back on the
16   record.  The time is 6:51 p.m.
17             MR. CROSS:  Sir, I think that's all the
18   questions that I have for you today.  I appreciate
19   your time.
20             THE WITNESS:  Well, thank you very much.
21             MR. JARCHI:  I have a few questions.  I
22   don't want to move, so can you just look at me so
23   he's not looking sideways at me.

 1                        EXAMINATION
 2   BY MR. JARCHI:
 3         Q.  Dr. Jones, did you see some engineering
 4   change notices from 1998 pertaining to replacing the
 5   seals on the doors of the DRO oven?
 6             MR. CROSS:  Object to form, leading,
 7   argumentative, assumes facts, lack of foundation.
 8             THE WITNESS:  I seem to recall such
 9   changes.
10   BY MR. JARCHI:
11         Q.  Okay.  And did you read some testimony in
12   the case from ITW personnel stating that those
13   changes would only be offered for products being
14   made from that time forward and there was not going
15   to be retroactive refurbishment or recall of those
16   seals on the door?
17         A.  I think that's correct.
18         Q.  Okay.  And do you have an opinion as to
19   whether or not there should have been some sort of a
20   refurbishment or recall in light of defendant's
21   knowledge of the breaches of the heat exchanger?
22             MR. CROSS:  Objection; form, assumes
23   facts, argumentative and lack of foundation.  Calls
24   for a narrative opinion.
25             THE WITNESS:  It seems logical that if
0361
 1   the -- going forward you would make these changes,
 2   then you ought to remediate the doors that exist.
 3             MR. JARCHI:  I printed out these photos.
 4   I'll mark these as exhibit --
 5             MR. CROSS:  Sure.  What are they?
 6             MR. JARCHI:  The photos he took.
 7             MR. CROSS:  Oh, from his inspection?
 8             MR. JARCHI:  Yes.  Let's see.  What do we
 9   mark these?  What's next?
10             MR. CROSS:  Mark these 10.
11             (Whereupon, Jones Exhibit 10 was
12             marked for identification by the
13             deposition reporter and is attached
14             hereto.)
15   BY MR. JARCHI:
16         Q.  Show you Exhibit 10, and does Exhibit 10
17   appear to be one of the photos you took of the
18   exemplar oven?
19         A.  Yeah, it does.  Oh, this is the exemplar
20   oven.  Sure.  Okay.  Got it.
21         Q.  And does that refresh your memory that at
22   some point you walked inside the oven, or the bake
23   chamber, I should say, and were able to see the heat
24   exchanger?
25         A.  That's right.  I do remember that now.
0362
 1         Q.  Okay.  And do you remember taking a magnet
 2   to test it and determining that the components were
 3   made of stainless steel on the lower tubes?
 4             MR. CROSS:  Objection to form,
 5   argumentative, leading, assumes facts, lacks
 6   foundation and misstates prior testimony.
 7             THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do remember testing
 8   them and they were stainless steel.
 9             MR. JARCHI:  Okay.  I don't have anything
10   else.
11             MR. CROSS:  I don't have any follow-up.
12             Thank you, sir.
13             THE WITNESS:  Thank you very much.
14             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Should I conclude?
15             MR. JARCHI:  Please.
16             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This concludes today's
17   deposition of Dr. James William Jones.  A total of
18   four media was used.  We're going off the record.
19   The time is 6:55 p.m.
20             (Whereupon, the following stipulation
21   agreed upon at the conclusion of the deposition of
22   Joellen Gill, M.S. taken on August 9, 2019, was
23   stipulated herein and is reprinted for reference; to
24   wit:
25             "MR. JARCHI:  I propose the
0363
 1             following stipulation:  We're
 2             going to relieve the court
 3             reporter of her duties with
 4             respect to signature of the
 5             transcript; the transcript
 6             will be prepared and sent
 7             directly to my offices.
 8             Actually, why don't we just
 9             send it to you.
10             Send it to Ms. Gill's address.
11             I think that's on your CV?
12             THE WITNESS:  It is.
13             MR. JARCHI:  And she will
14             then review it, make changes,
15             if necessary, sign it, send
16             it back to me.
17             And I will notify -- she'll
18             have 30 days to do that and
19             I'll notify all counsel of
20             any changes, if any, in
21             writing, and if the original
22             transcript is lost, destroyed,
23             unsigned or for any reason
24             not available, a certified
25             unsigned copy can be used for
0364
 1             any and all purposes as if it
 2             were the signed original.
 3             I will maintain custody of
 4             the original transcript and
 5             make it available upon
 6             reasonable request at the
 7             time of trial.
 8             So stipulate?
 9             MR. NEWTON:  If that's the
10             stipulation that has been
11             stipulated to before, that
12             sounds --
13             MR. JARCHI:  I think it has
14             been.
15             MR. NEWTON:  Yeah, we agree
16             on that basis.")

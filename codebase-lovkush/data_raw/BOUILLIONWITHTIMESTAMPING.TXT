 08:57 15  BY MS. LUNCEFORD:

 08:57 16      Q.   Will you state your full name for the record,

       17  please.

 08:57 18      A.   Richard Anthony Boullion.

 08:57 19      Q.   Mr. Boullion, my name is Erin Lunceford.  And

       20  we just met, correct?

 08:57 21      A.   Yes, ma'am.

 08:57 22      Q.   I represent the defendant, Kuraray, in this

       23  case, and we're going to take your deposition today.

 08:58 24      A.   Yes, ma'am.

 08:58 25      Q.   If -- I tend to kind of go fast through this

        1  stuff.  So if I ask you something that you don't

        2  understand, if I can get your agreement just to ask me

        3  to repeat or rephrase my question.  Is that okay?

 08:58  4      A.   Yes, ma'am.

 08:58  5      Q.   And you're doing a great job so far.  Try not

        6  to talk on top of each other.  I'll try not to start

        7  another question before you finish.  That way the court

        8  reporter doesn't get mad at us.  Is that okay?

 08:58  9      A.   Yes, ma'am.

 08:58 10      Q.   And one final thing:  If you would answer

       11  "yes" or "no," or whatever the answer is as, opposed to

       12  "uh-huh" and "uh-uh," because that doesn't come across

       13  very well on the record.

 08:58 14      A.   I'm straightforward.

 08:58 15      Q.   Okay.  And I always warn people that if you do

       16  say "uh-huh" by mistake, I just say, "Is that a yes?"

       17  And I warn you that I'm not trying to pick on you.  I'm

       18  just trying to get a clear record.

 08:58 19      A.   That's fine.

 08:58 20      Q.   Okay.  What -- have you ever been deposed

       21  before?

 08:58 22      A.   Do what?

 08:58 23      Q.   Have you ever had a deposition before?

 09:24  1      A.   It's all the way -- somewhere in here.

 09:24  2      Q.   Can you put the word "paint" where the paint

        3  hooch is?  Like just general.

 09:24  4      A.   Because you got to go all the way down here.

        5  And I would turn.  So I'm assuming it's -- because I

        6  would have to walk around from here.  So it's somewhere

        7  in this vicinity, but, I -- I mean, I don't know which

        8  one of these --

 09:24  9      Q.   Just put a circle where -- and put a "P" for

 09:24 14      A.   I didn't make it there.

 09:24 15      Q.   No, I know.  But that's what you would when

        1  time of the incident.

 09:25  2      A.   Yeah, we were talking.  We -- I was his boss.

 09:26 14      Q.   Okay.  And why is it required that you wear

       15  the FRC?

 09:26 16      A.   Well, it's fire-retardant clothing.

 09:26 17      Q.   And when you're working in a plant, you always

       18  wear it?

 09:26 19      A.   Always.  I wear them every day of my life.

 09:26 20      Q.   And do you recall what your designated muster

       10  where you were when it happened?

 09:35  5      Q.   Okay.  So when you say you were at that "E" --

 09:35  6      A.   I'm assuming that's it.  It was just a big ol'

        7  building right at the parking lot.  And they had us

 09:35  8  all -- they herd us in there and start badging.

 09:35  9      Q.   Okay.

 09:35 10      A.   Start -- for accountability.  They want to

       11  make sure everybody was there.

 09:35 12      Q.   Okay.  And was that after you'd been in the

       13  parking lot for a while?

 09:35 14      A.   Yes.

       19  building?

 09:35 20      A.   A few hours.  I know we was in there for a

       21  while.

 09:35 22      Q.   So you were in the parking lot for a couple

       23  hours and then --

 09:35 24      A.   Then in the building and back outside and then

       25  back in the building, badging in and out again.

 09:35  1      Q.   And you don't know how long this process --

 09:35  2      A.   I don't know, ma'am.  It was a while.

 09:35  3      Q.   Did you go straight home after you --

 09:36 12      Q.   And why did you take the aspirin?

 09:36 13      A.   Because I started aching.

 09:36 14      Q.   And where were you aching?

 09:36 15      A.   My back and my knees.

 09:36 16      Q.   Did you apply ice or heat to any part of your

       17  body that day?

 09:36  1      Q.   What about on Monday, the day after that?

 09:36  2      A.   I think that's when we went back, and we

        3  didn't do anything.

 10:28  1      Q.   So that would be the case -- just so I

          15   BY MS. NOSARI:

          16   Q.     Good morning.  My name is Katherine Nosari, and I

          17   represent the defendant in this action.  I know you were

          18   just here sitting through the deposition of your wife, so

          19   you saw what happened.

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     Do you want me to go over the instructions that I

          22   gave her at the beginning of her deposition, or did you

          23   also hear and understand them?

          24   A.     If you could repeat them.

          25   Q.     Absolutely.  So there's a court reporter here.
                                                                      5



           1   He's taking down everything we say.  So when you respond

           2   to the questions, you have to do so verbally because he

           3   has to be able to hear what you're saying -- or what the

           4   interpreter, when the interpreter interprets it, and write

           5   it down.  So you can't shrug your shoulders or shake your

           6   head, and try to avoid "uh-huh" or "uh-uh."  Say "yes" or

           7   "no" just so we know clearly what your answer is.

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     And if at any point today I ask you something and

          10   you want me to repeat it or rephrase it, you didn't hear

          11   it or understand it, I'll be happy to do so.  Just let me

          12   know.

          13   A.     Yeah.

          14   Q.     I don't want you to answer a question unless you've

          15   heard it completely and understand it completely.

          16   A.     Of course.

          17   Q.     Also, if I ask you a question and you don't know

          18   the answer or you don't remember the answer, that's okay

          19   to tell me as long as it's the truth.  We don't want you

          20   to guess here today at all.  If you -- if you do feel

          21   comfortable estimating or approximating something, that's

          22   okay.  Just let us know that.

          23   A.     Very good.

          24   Q.     And you understand that the oath that you took

          25   today is the same oath you would take if we -- if you were
                                                                      6



           1   testifying in front of a judge or a jury?

           2   A.     Very good.

           3   Q.     Thank you.  I -- before the deposition, there was a

           4   discussion that you took some medication.  What medication

           5   was that?

           6   A.     It's metformin and Amaryl.

           7   Q.     What are those medications for?

           8   A.     For diabetes.

           9   Q.     Both of them?

          10   A.     Yes.

          11   Q.     Do they affect your ability to hear things,

          12   understand things, and respond to my questions truthfully?

          13   A.     No.

          14   Q.     Are you under the influence of any other medication

          15   or substance that would impair your ability to understand?

          16   A.     No.

          17   Q.     All right.  What is your full name for the record?

          18   A.     Telesforo Camacho-Lopez.

          19   Q.     And is Camacho-Lopez hyphenated legally?

          20   A.     Yes, because they're separated.  Camacho is like my

          21   last name.

          22   Q.     And what is your date of birth?

          23   A.     January 5th of '73.

          24   Q.     And you live at the address that your wife gave me,

          25   correct?
                                                                      7

          20   offered a job, that's when I can actually go to work.

           1   so -- because the people who had -- who had called about

           2   the other car, he had gone over to verify about him.

           3   Q.     And did you ever talk to those people that were

           4   traveling behind you?

           5   A.     No.

           9   A.     On the left shoulder.

          10   Q.     So -- 'cause the emergency room records that, I

          11   guess, you went to the next day -- right?  You went to the

          12   emergency room the next day; is that correct?

          13   A.     We went.  My wife took me to the hospital.

          15   A.     Was it Saturday?  Was it Monday?

          16   Q.     Maybe it wasn't the next day.  Two days?

          17   A.     I don't remember.  I don't remember.

          18   Q.     The medical records we have say that you were

          19   admitted April 10th, so -- so that would be, I guess, two

          21   A.     Monday.  I didn't know.

          22   Q.     And those records from Reading Health say that you

          23   had right shoulder and right arm complaints.  Would you

           6   didn't know about that.

           7   Q.     So did you have -- did they ever get an interpreter

           8   for you?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     They did?

          11   A.     Yes.  The issue is:  I really didn't receive any

          12   treatment.  I just arrive, and then they just ask me a few

          13   little things.

          14   Q.     Did you tell them what -- where you were feeling

          15   pain?

          16   A.     I told them.  But the only thing that they ask is

          17   if I had medical insurance, and when I said no...

          18   Q.     Did they do anything for you after that, or did

          19   they -- what did they do?

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     Did you leave after that?

          22   A.     Yes.  They called me and they said that I was fine.

          23   And then I left.

          24   Q.     Were you physically examined by a doctor?

          25   A.     They just touched my shoulder.
                                                                     20



           1   Q.     They did -- and -- and you're saying they touched

           2   your left shoulder?

           3   A.     Yes.  My wife was surprised when I told her that I

           4   had been already examined.  She said, "So quickly?"

          16   Q.     Did anyone -- had you ever treated there before?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     And do you know who referred you to that location?

          19   A.     My wife was the one.

          20   Q.     And you were getting therapy there; is that

           3   Q.     And how long did you treat there?

           4   A.     Like for six months.

           5   Q.     And during that time, were you referred to get an

           6   MRI?

           7   A.     Yes, they sent me.

           8   Q.     And what was your understanding of the results of

           9   the MRI?

          10   A.     The MRI was done at -- what's the name?

          11   Q.     I don't know -- I don't -- I don't necessarily care

          12   where it was done, but did they go over what the -- did

          13   any doctor go over the results of the MRI testing he had?

          14   A.     Yes.  The -- he did.  And then, they told me.  And

          15   then, they sent me to Hershey to continue with treatment.

          16   Q.     What did they tell you?  And I don't -- they

          17   don't -- you don't have to use medical words.  Just

          18   generally, what was your understanding of what -- what it

          19   was showed?

          20   A.     That I had like a fissure on the shoulder.

          21   Q.     Fissure, okay.

          22   A.     A fissure.

          23   Q.     And then, when you were at Hershey, is that where

          24   they did an injection?

          25   A.     Yes.
                                                                     22



           1   Q.     Did you only have one into the shoulder?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And was it helpful?

           4   A.     What can I tell you?  For a month.

           5   Q.     Did you ever go back to get another one?

           6   A.     No.  They were going to do another surgery.  They

           7   wanted to.

           8   Q.     They recommended surgery?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     And did you undergo surgery?

          11   A.     No.

          12   Q.     And why not?

          13   A.     Because what the insurance had been paying for had

          14   already run out, and I don't have the money to pay for

          15   such a surgery.

          16   Q.     So if you did have insurance to pay for the

          17   surgery, would you have received it?

          18   A.     Well, yes, because I can't be with this pain like

          19   this.

          20   Q.     Did any doctors ever give you pain medication?

          21   A.     They gave me medicine.  I don't remember now what

          22   the medicine was.

          23   Q.     Was it just one medication?

          24   A.     Yes.  Sorry.

          25   Q.     That's all right.  Did you ever take it?
                                                                     23



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     How long did you take it for?

           3   A.     For a month.

           4   Q.     Why just one month?

           5   A.     Since I already mentioned that we ran out of

           6   insurance, I couldn't keep going to Hershey.

           7   Q.     So Hershey was the one that prescribed it?

           8   A.     Yes, Hershey prescribed it.

           9   Q.     And I think -- I'm sorry.  I forgot to kind of go

          10   over this.  So obviously, you had left shoulder pain.  Did

          11   you have any other type of pain to other parts of your

          12   body after the accident?

          13   A.     In the back.  But after the accident, there was

          14   also in the back and also the neck.

          15   Q.     And when you say "back," what -- what part of the

          16   back?

          17   A.     On the upper back.

          18   Q.     And did you ever have any pain that went down to

          19   the arm -- down into the arm?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     Can you describe that pain for me.

          22   A.     Sometimes, the pain is very strong.

          23   Q.     What does it feel like?  Can you describe it.

          24   A.     Like an eight percent of pain.

          25   Q.     It was at one out of ten, being one out of ten?
                                                                     24



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     So ten would be the most.  So it's about an eight?

           3   A.     An eight percent.

           4   Q.     But -- but meaning eight out of ten?

           5   A.     From one to eight.

           6   Q.     When you say "an eight," I just want to make sure

           7   we're on the same scale.  So is that using a scale of one

           8   being little to no pain and ten being the most amount of

           9   pain?

          10   A.     That one.  Exactly.

          11   Q.     And do you ever have any like tingling or numbness

          12   or weakness in the left arm?

          13   A.     I'm beginning to feel it.

          14   Q.     When did you start to feel it?

          15   A.     It's been like six, seven months since I began to

          16   feel it.

          17   Q.     And what specifically of those have you felt?

          18   A.     Sort of like -- you know, like tingling that comes

          19   down my arm.  Like it gets numb.

          20   Q.     All right.  And were the -- when you were getting

          21   therapy, they were also treating the neck and back pain?

          22   A.     I get massages.

          23   Q.     So currently, as of today, where are you still

          24   feeling pain, if any?

          25   A.     On the left shoulder.
                                                                     25



           1   Q.     Do you still have any more neck or upper back pain?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And do you still -- and you're still having the

           4   pain down the left arm?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     So nothing has resolved?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     How often do you get neck or upper back pain?

           9   A.     Sorry?

          10   Q.     How often do you get neck and upper back pain?

          11   A.     Oh.  How often?

          12   Q.     Yes.

          13   A.     Daily.

          14   Q.     Are the neck and upper back pain, do they come

          15   together, or do you get separate pain in those body parts?

          16   A.     It's at the same time that I have the pain.

          17   Q.     And how often throughout the day do you have neck

          18   or upper back pain?

          19   A.     Well, they go away when I take the pill.  But all

          20   of this time, I've been already feeling like the tingling

          21   and the numbness.

          22   Q.     In the neck and upper back, you feel tingling and

          23   numbness?

          24   A.     No, just on the arm.

          25   Q.     Well, right now, I'm just talking about the neck
                                                                     26



           1   and upper back.

           2   A.     No.  The neck and the -- and the back is only the

           3   pain.

           4   Q.     Right.  Okay.  So how -- how -- you said you have

           5   that pain daily?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     How often throughout the day?

           8   A.     Well, like I said, it's a whole day.  It only goes

           9   away when I take the -- the pain medicine.

          10   Q.     So it's constant throughout the day unless you take

          11   pain medicine?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     And what pain medication are you taking?

          14   A.     Tylenol.

          15   Q.     This is just over the counter?

          16   A.     Right, with a -- a prescription.

          17   Q.     All right.  And then, the left shoulder, how often

          18   do you get that pain?

          19   A.     Also daily.

          20   Q.     Also constant through the day?

          21   A.     Yes.

          22   Q.     Does the Tylenol help with that?

          23   A.     A little.

          24   Q.     Do you do any other home treatment for your left

          25   shoulder?
                                                                     27



           1   A.     My wife, sometimes she'll just like rub me with

           2   menthol or vapor rub.

           3   Q.     Any other type of home treatment?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     And then, how often do you get the numbness and

           6   tingling in the left arm?

           7   A.     Often.

           8   Q.     Every day?

           9   A.     Yeah.

          10   Q.     How often throughout the day?

          11   A.     It could be like in three hours, it goes away.

          12   Q.     About every three hours?

          13   A.     Not every three hours.  It's like supposing.  Is

          14   that how you say it?

          15   Q.     I don't -- I don't know what you're trying to say.

          16   I guess I'm just wondering how often you have that pain

          17   during the day.  Does it come, you know, only in the

          18   mornings, or does it come every few hours during the day?

          19                  MR. TIMONEY:  Is this tingling in the

          20   shoulder?

          21                  MS. NOSARI:  Yes.

          22   BY MS. NOSARI:

          23   Q.     This is just the tingling that you described.

          24   A.     Well, the tingling, I feel it all day.

          25   Q.     So it's constant throughout the day?
                                                                     28



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     So every day, constantly throughout the day, you're

           3   having neck pain, upper back pain, left shoulder pain, and

           4   tingling -- and tingling and numbness in the arm?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Any other parts of your body or complaints you had

           7   after this accident that we didn't discuss?

           8   A.     No, just the neck, the shoulder, and the back.

           9   Q.     And then, other than -- all the -- did we discuss

          10   all the treatment you've had?  We discussed the ER we had;

          11   you had the therapy; and you went to Hershey and had the

          12   injection.

          13   A.     Well, you know, like the only other thing is --

          14   would be like here.  And this part is kind of like the

          15   bone.  It has kind of -- has kind of gone deep in like a

          16   hole.  Like it's been like pushed in.

          17   Q.     So you're saying there's some type of like

          18   deformity to the shoulder?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Can you describe that a little more.  Where is it?

          21   How big is it?

          22   A.     It's on the back of the shoulder, and it's just

          23   kind of like pushed in.

          24   Q.     All right.  And how large is this -- this pushed-in

          25   area?
                                                                     29



           1   A.     I'd say like three fingers.

           2   Q.     Have you ever taken any photographs of it?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     I'm gonna ask that you do that.

           5                  MS. NOSARI:  I mean I -- I don't want to --

           6                  MR. TIMONEY:  Yeah.

           7                  MS. NOSARI:  Or maybe you could do it?

           8                  MR. TIMONEY:  I'm just trying -- it doesn't

           9   come up great in photographs.  Like you can see it in real

          10   life, but it's all skin-colored.  Do you know what I mean?

          11   So when you -- we can try it again, see if we can get it.

          12   BY MS. NOSARI:

          13   Q.     Would you mind showing me?

          14                  MR. TIMONEY:  Yeah.  We can show you.

          15                  THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

          16                  MR. TIMONEY:  Yeah.

          17                  MS. NOSARI:  Okay.

          18                  MR. TIMONEY:  It -- it is better to see.

          19                  MS. NOSARI:  Sure.

          20   BY MS. NOSARI:

          21   Q.     Whenever you feel ready.  And I'll see if I can

          22   take a picture.  If I can't -- if it doesn't come out,

          23   then...

          24                  MR. TIMONEY:  Yeah.  It's -- like it's

          25   just -- so -- so if you look at the -- it's hard to see.
                                                                     30



           1   It's right there.  It's like a divot compared to the other

           2   side.

           3                  MS. NOSARI:  Okay.

           4                  MR. TIMONEY:  You see how it doesn't come

           5   out really in the photo.

           6                  MS. NOSARI:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.

           7   BY MS. NOSARI:

           8   Q.     So you're -- you're saying it's right here in this

           9   area?

          10   A.     Exactly.

          11                  MR. TIMONEY:  Can you put your finger on

          12   it.  Yeah.

          13                  MS. NOSARI:  And I'm just gonna describe it

          14   for the record.  So he's alleging an area about

          15   three-finger width that's just below the -- the top, on

          16   the collarbone area of the shoulder.

          17                  THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          18                  MS. NOSARI:  Okay.  Thanks.  Let me just

          19   try to take a photo and then that way --

          20                  MR. TIMONEY:  That's fine.

          21                  MS. NOSARI:  Thank you.

          22   BY MS. NOSARI:

          23   Q.     And, of course, it's your testimony that that was

          24   not there prior to the accident, correct?

          25   A.     No.
                                                                     31



           1   Q.     So, again, other than the treatment that we

           2   discussed -- so you had the emergency room visit, you had

           3   the therapy, you had the MRIs, and you had the injection

           4   at Hershey -- any other treatment that you had that we

           5   didn't discuss?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Do you have any future treatment planned like you

           8   have a doctor's visit scheduled or you're planning to make

           9   a doctor's visit?

          10   A.     I'd like to.  I don't want to go through this pain.

          11   Q.     You would like to?

          12   A.     Of course.

          13   Q.     But you haven't scheduled anything?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     I want to talk a little bit about any ways your

          16   life has been affected by the injuries you're alleging,

          17   so did -- did -- anything you did prior to the accident

          18   that you notice you can't do anymore or you can't do as

          19   well.

          20   A.     Like bathing, you know, I struggle doing that.  I

          21   can't reach in the back.  I do also struggle when I have

          22   to use my left arm to use on my head.  Also, at home, I

          23   used to help with the cleaning to my wife, but I just

          24   can't anymore.

          25   Q.     So bathing -- what is difficult with bathing is
                                                                     32



           1   reaching your back?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     And is that using your left arm?

           4   A.     When I do, yeah.

           5   Q.     And then, you mentioned just using the arm in

           6   general.  What kind of things do you notice that you can't

           7   do with your left arm?

           8   A.     I used to paint the house or even to help my wife

           9   to mop.

          10   Q.     Are you left- or right-handed?

          11   A.     To write, the right one.

          12   Q.     Do you have any lifting restriction with regard to

          13   the left arm?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     What?

          16   A.     Heavy things.

          17   Q.     What's -- what is -- can you give me either a

          18   weight amount or an example of something you wouldn't

          19   lift?

          20   A.     Twenty pounds.  Like before, I used to lift up

          21   above.  I can't.

          22   Q.     So 20 or more pounds?

          23   A.     From 20 or more pounds.

          24   Q.     And are you alleging any actual restriction in how

          25   much you can move the shoulder in terms of like:  Do you
                                                                     33



           1   have full range of motion, or are you alleging a

           2   restriction in your -- in your range of motion?

           3   A.     Move it completely, no.

           4   Q.     So what is the -- and I understand moving it can

           5   cause pain; is that correct?

           6   A.     Yes.

           7   Q.     But do you actually have a -- a limit in terms of

           8   moving it that you actually physically can't move it past

           9   a certain point, either if it's up or down or back?

          10   A.     Right now I'm on my limit.

          11   Q.     Well, can you describe for me if you have any

          12   actual physical limit in terms of like lifting it up.  Do

          13   you have any limit in actually physically lifting your arm

          14   up?  I don't want you to try to -- I don't want you to

          15   hurt yourself trying to do it.  I'm just asking if -- you

          16   know, if you actually physically can't move your arm or do

          17   something with your arm that you were able to before.

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     What is your limitation?

          20   A.     Half from what before I used to lift.

          21   Q.     Well, I don't mean -- so let me just try to explain

          22   it in a better way.  So -- so what I mean is:  I

          23   understand you have pain with doing things with your arm

          24   as to what you've testified to, lifting it, using it.  I

          25   understand that.  I'm just asking if there's actually a
                                                                     34



           1   physical restriction in -- in terms of the movement of

           2   your arm, so you can't move your arm past a certain point,

           3   whether it be if you're moving it up or back or out, that

           4   you've noticed.

           5   A.     Let's say if I have to change a lightbulb.  So if

           6   I'm going to be using my left arm in order to replace that

           7   lightbulb, I can't really have it for that long in order

           8   to do it.  And other times, when my arm goes numb, then

           9   even I drop things from my hand.

          10   Q.     Anything else you want to tell me about in terms of

          11   using your left -- your left arm?

          12   A.     Well, this I mentioned already.  You know, as I've

          13   been saying, I'm struggling with all of these.  It's just

          14   that things that I used to do before, I'm not able to do

          15   it.  Things that I used to help out my wife with, I'm not

          16   able to help her cleaning or even like vacuuming or doing

          17   anything like that.  I'm just not able.  Things that used

          18   to take me a little bit of time to do now take me longer.

          19   Q.     Any things in particular that -- like examples you

          20   can give me other than what you've already told me?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     And did -- your wife testified that you guys would

          23   go dancing about twice a month prior to the accident and

          24   that you no longer do that.  Would you agree with that

          25   testimony?
                                                                     35



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     Is that only because of her injuries that she's

           3   alleging or also because you don't -- because of your

           4   injuries?

           5   A.     More than anything, for her injuries.

           6   Q.     And would you also agree with her testimony about

           7   having to pay a friend to clean the home?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     You agree with the amount she testified to, the 50

          10   to 75 dollars and that it's about every week?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     All right.  Were there any other like hobbies or

          13   interests like dancing that -- that you had before the

          14   accident that were -- you're -- you're alleging are

          15   affected by the injuries?

          16   A.     My hobbies were just to remodel the house.  That's

          17   how I would spend my time.

          18   Q.     And what kind of remodeling would you do around

          19   your house?

          20   A.     Like painting, whenever she just changes her mind

          21   about that.  So like I'm fixing the basement.

          22   Q.     Painting the basement?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     And you mentioned "fixing."  Are you doing some

          25   other type of repairs in the basement?
                                                                     36



           1   A.     Yeah, like fixing the basement.

           2   Q.     Like what?  What in the basement needed to be

           3   fixed?

           4   A.     So what we call is -- like we just cover whatever

           5   the wall is like has holes or spots in it.  We just kind

           6   of even it out.  We just slap -- slap on it and finish it.

           7   Q.     Like fixing holes or scrapes or scratches on the

           8   wall?

           9   A.     Like that.

          10   Q.     What else around the house, if anything?

          11   A.     Just that.

          12   Q.     Did you ever have to pay anyone to come help you

          13   with your house remodeling after the accident?

          14   A.     I've been doing it by myself whichever way I can.

          15   Q.     Anything else you want to tell me about in terms of

          16   effects on your life or lifestyle that we haven't already

          17   spoken about?

          18   A.     No.  It's fine.

          19   Q.     And then, prior to this accident occurring, had you

          20   ever -- let's start with your neck -- have you ever

          21   injured your neck before?

          22   A.     No.

          23   Q.     Ever injure your upper back before?

          24   A.     No.

          25   Q.     Had you ever had to go to a doctor for any type of
                                                                     37



           1   complaints in the neck or upper back before this accident?

           2   A.     No.

           3   Q.     Ever injure your left shoulder or left arm before

           4   this accident?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Ever have to go to a doctor for left shoulder or

           7   left arm pain prior to this accident?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     The tingling and numbness you described in your

          10   left arm, have you ever had that feeling prior to this

          11   accident?

          12   A.     No.

          13                  MS. NOSARI:  All right.  I don't think I

          14   have any other questions, then.

          15                  MR. TIMONEY:  Just a few clarifications.

          16   BY MR. TIMONEY:

          17   Q.     In your physical therapy records, it said something

          18   about cutting food.  Do you recall what that's about?

          19   A.     Well, sometimes when I'm cutting my food, you know,

          20   like my arm just kind of gets numb.  I don't do it as I

          21   used to.  There are times that I just forget, that I just

          22   go to grab the glass, and all of a sudden, it just slips

          23   right out.

          24   Q.     And today, I saw your wife helped you with your

          25   shirt.  Are there -- does your wife have to help you get
                                                                     38



           1   dressed for certain things?

           2   A.     Yes, getting dressed.  And also, when I'm taking a

           3   bath, you know, she's the one who's gonna help me with my

           4   back.

           5   Q.     And also, in the medical records, there was

           6   something about burning pain.  Do you recall anything

           7   about that?

           8   A.     The shoulder, sometimes I feel like fire.

           9                  MR. TIMONEY:  Thank you.

          10   BY MS. NOSARI:

          11   Q.     Are you only requiring help from your wife in terms

          12   of taking on and off a shirt?  Are there -- or are there

          13   other aspects of dressing that you require help with?

          14   A.     No.  Whenever I have to like put on the shirt or

          15   take it off, she helps me with that.  Or whenever I get

          16   itchy on my back, she helps me with that.

          17   Q.     Itching on your back?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     So the dressing is only related to like taking off

          20   and on a shirt?

          21   A.     To put on and take it off, the shirt.

          22   Q.     And the burning pain is -- you only feel in the

          23   left shoulder?

          24   A.     This is the back part of the shoulder.

          25   Q.     The back part of the shoulder?
                                                                     39

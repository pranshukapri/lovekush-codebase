         10     EXAMINATION OF TAMI BOLDER, CPA/ABV, ASA, MBA, DBA

         11     BY-MR.UEBLER:

         12     Q   Good morning, Dr. Bolder.

         13     A   Good morning.

         14     Q   As you know, I represent Patrick Daugherty in

         15         the case that's pending in the Delaware Court

         16         of Chancery.

         17               Would you describe for me your assignment

         18         in this matter?

         19     A   My assignment, as described in the Scope

         20         section of my report, I can review with you.

         21     Q   Sure.

         22               I'll hand you what's been marked as

         23         Bolder Exhibit 1.  Would you just review it and

         24         confirm that that is your report?

         25     A   Yes.  This is my report.  And the Scope of my



                                                                  5


          1         report was limited to a review of the opinions

          2         set forth in the Wazzan report, W A Z Z A N.

          3     Q   And where would I find the Scope in your

          4         report?

          5     A   That is on page 2.

          6     Q   Are you offering any opinions in this matter

          7         that are not contained in Bolder Exhibit 1?

          8     A   No.

          9     Q   Are you offering any opinions in this matter

         10         that do not respond to opinions offered by

         11         Dr. Wazzan in this matter?

         12     A   That don't respond?  I'm not sure I understand.

         13     Q   Are you offering any opinions in this matter

         14         that are independent of Dr. Wazzan's opinions,

         15         any new or additional topics?

         16                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Objection.  Form.

         17     A   No.

         18     Q   Are you offering an opinion in this matter

         19         regarding the assets of HERA at any point in

         20         time?

         21     A   No.

         22     Q   Are you offering an opinion in this matter

         23         regarding the solvency of HERA at any point in

         24         time?

         25     A   No.



                                                                  6


          1     Q   Are you offering an opinion of the value of any

          2         of the escrow assets?

          3     A   No.  I wasn't engaged to provide a value of the

          4         assets.

          5     Q   And when I say, "Escrow assets", you understand

          6         I'm referring to the assets that were placed in

          7         escrow with Abrams & Bayliss?

          8     A   Yes.

          9     Q   What do you understand those assets to be?

         10     A   As stated in the report, it's the cash in

         11         escrow, the shares in NHF and then the shares

         12         of RCP.

         13     Q   You're not offering an opinion regarding the

         14         value of the shares of RCP?

         15     A   I am not offering opinion of value.  I was

         16         engaged to review Wazzan's opinions.

         17     Q   You're not offering an opinion regarding a

         18         value of the NHF shares?

         19     A   Of the NHF shares?

         20     Q   Yeah.

         21     A   I, in my report, merely pointed out that he

         22         used an inappropriate share price.

         23     Q   Apart from pointing that out, you're not

         24         offering your own opinion of value of those

         25         shares?



                                                                  7


          1     A   I guess to the extent that the share price was

          2         incorrect and that he used the incorrect value

          3         of the shares, my opinion is that the incorrect

          4         share price was used and it should have been

          5         based on a different price based on my review

          6         of his report.

          7     Q   Is it your opinion that Dr. Wazzan got the

          8         value wrong for the NHF shares?

          9     A   Well, based on my review of his original

         10         report, it appeared that he used the wrong

         11         date.

         12     Q   Are you opining regarding what the Court should

         13         find the value to be of the NHF shares?

         14     A   No.  Not as I sit here at this time.

         15     Q   Are you offering an opinion regarding the value

         16         of the cash that was placed in escrow?

         17     A   No.

         18     Q   You sat through Dr. Wazzan's deposition on

         19         Friday, right?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   Did any of your opinions or analyses reflected

         22         in Bolder 1 change after having sat through

         23         Dr. Wazzan's deposition on Friday?

         24     A   No.

         25     Q   Have you had an opportunity to review the



                                                                  8


          1         updated report of Dr. Wazzan dated August 22,

          2         2019?

          3     A   I skimmed through it, but I have not had an

          4         opportunity to review it in-depth.

          5     Q   Based on your skimming of Dr. Wazzan's updated

          6         report, did any of your opinions or analyses

          7         reflected in Bolder 1 change?

          8                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Objection.  Form.

          9     A   Well, to the extent that he corrected some of

         10         the errors that I pointed out in my report, to

         11         that extent, yes.

         12     Q   And I'll do my best to cover those today --

         13     A   Sure.

         14     Q   -- so we can cover all of our bases.

         15     A   Okay.

         16     Q   Would you turn to the CV portion of Bolder 1?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Is it correct you're a Senior Manager for CBIZ?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Explain to me what that means in terms of the

         21         hierarchy of -- well, let me back up.

         22               Which part of CBIZ do you work in?

         23     A   I'm in the valuation group.

         24     Q   As a Senior Manager of the valuation group of

         25         CBIZ, what are your responsibilities?



                                                                  9

          3         development.

          4     Q   Do you report to anybody?

          7     Q   Did you say Dee?

          8     A   Yes.

         15     A   Currently, five.

         16     Q   Of those five, how many are you leading or

         17         responsible for?

         18     A   All of them.

         19     Q   What's the nature of each of those five

         20         assignments high level?  What are you valuing?

         21     A   Most of them are operating entities.  I do have

         22         one holding company.

         23     Q   So all five are valuation of entities?

         24     A   Operating entities, yes.

         25     Q   Of those five, how many are litigation matters?



                                                                  10


          1     A   Do you consider divorce litigation?

          2     Q   Is there a pending court proceeding?

          3     A   It hasn't been filed yet.  But if divorce is

          4         considered, if that would be considered

          5         litigation, then three of them.

          6     Q   How long have you been with CBIZ?

          7     A   Approximately two years.

          8     Q   Have you been a Senior Manager for your

          9         two years?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   You were at BDO before that?

         12     A   Yes.

         13     Q   How long were you at BDO?

         14     A   Well, BDO acquired my prior firm, SS&G, in

         15         2015, so officially with BDO for two years.

         16     Q   What was your prior firm's name?

         17     A   SS&G.

         18     Q   When did you start with SS&G?

         19     A   In 2000, approximately.

         20     Q   What was your position with BDO?

         21     A   I was a Senior Manager.

         22     Q   Were your responsibilities similar to your

         23         responsibilities currently?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   How about with SS&G starting in 2000?



                                                                  11


          1     A   Starting in 2000 I was an Associate and then

          2         through the years was promoted to Associate

          3         Director.

          4     Q   Did your work at Ernst & Young include the

          5         valuation-type work that you're doing now?

          6     A   No.

          7     Q   When did you work for the New Ventures

          8         Consulting Group of Cap Gemini Ernst & Young?

          9     A   That was in 2000.  I was there for a year.

         10     Q   In 2000 you were at Ernst & Young for a year

         11         and then you --

         12     A   Moved to SS&G.

         13     Q   When you moved to SS&G, is that when your

         14         valuation work began?

         15     A   Well, it started shortly after I started with

         16         SS&G.  When I initially started I was in the

         17         strategy group of SS&G.

         18     Q   What's that?

         19     A   We worked with start-up companies and helped

         20         them with business plans and other services.

         21     Q   When you began your valuation work at SS&G,

         22         what training did you receive?

         23     A   We had internal training and then I also went

         24         through training to receive my accreditation in

         25         business valuation through the AICPA.

          1     Q   You're a CPA?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   When did you become a CPA?

          4     A   In 2000.

          5     Q   It was a busy year?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   Do you have to be a CPA to have an ABV

          8         designation?

          9     A   Not at this time.  That was recently changed.

         10     Q   When was that changed?

         11     A   Just recently within the past year,

         12         year-and-a-half.

         13     Q   You received your Doctorate in Business

         14         Administration from the University of Phoenix?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   When was that?

         17     A   In 2012.

         18     Q   What's the difference between a Doctorate in

         19         Business Administration and a Ph.D.?

         20     A   The Doctorate is geared more for people who

         21         intend to practice an industry versus teach at

         22         a university.

         23     Q   How many years did you spend obtaining your DBA

         24         from the University of Phoenix?

         25     A   About four-and-a-half.



                                                                  13


          1     Q   Were those online classes or classroom classes?

          2     A   They were both online and in the classroom.

          3     Q   Was that local here in Cleveland or some other

          4         location?

          5     A   It was in Phoenix.

          6     Q   Did you complete a dissertation as part of your

          7         DBA?

          8     A   Yes.

          9     Q   What was the topic of that?

         10     A   The title of my dissertation was

         11         Entrepreneurial Success:  A Mixed Method

         12         Sequential Study of African Americans and

         13         Hispanics in Financial Services.

         14     Q   Did you have to defend your dissertation as

         15         part of your degree?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   Let's see.  You also have an MBA.  When did you

         18         obtain your MBA degree?

         19     A   In 2000.

         20     Q   I read on your CV that you're an Accredited

         21         Senior Appraiser, also known as ASA, is that

         22         right?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   And you already told me about your ABV

         25         designation?



                                                                  14


          1     A   Yes.

          2     Q   Do you have any other valuation designations or

          3         certifications?

          4     A   No.  Just those two.

          5     Q   Is there any difference, in your view, between

          6         the valuation standards for ASA and ABV?

          7     A   There's just minor differences in the wording

          8         of what they call the different reports, but

          9         the substance is fairly similar.

         10     Q   What are the minor differences?

         11     A   So for the AICPA valuation standards they have

         12         calculation reports and valuation reports and

         13         then for ASA they're called limited scope

         14         reports versus a calculation report under the

         15         AICPA.

         16     Q   The calculation report that you're referring

         17         to, is that what you described in your expert

         18         report?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Are there any other differences between the

         21         ASA and ABV valuation standards?

         22     A   There are.  I can't name all of them as I sit

         23         here, but there are some additional

         24         differences.

         25     Q   Do you recall Dr. Wazzan testifying about the



                                                                  15


          1         willing buyer and seller standard on Friday?

          2     A   Vaguely.

          3     Q   Are you familiar with that concept?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   What's your understanding of that concept?

          6     A   Well, basically for a valuation I mean there

          7         has to be a willing buyer and willing seller

          8         who's negotiating a fair market value price.

          9     Q   Is that concept incorporated within the

         10         ASA valuation standards?

         11     A   I don't know if it is specifically stated in

         12         the valuation standards.  I can't recall

         13         offhand if they actually use those terms within

         14         the standards.

         15     Q   How about the ASA standard?

         16     A   I can't recall if those terms are specifically

         17         listed within the standards.

         18     Q   Whether or not the terms are specifically

         19         listed, does the concept -- let me ask it

         20         differently.

         21               Whether those terms are included, is the

         22         content consistent with the ABV valuation

         23         standard?

         24                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Object to form.

         25     A   Well, I guess I don't really understand the



                                                                  16


          1         question.

          2     Q   I asked you for your understanding of the

          3         willing buyer and seller concept, right?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   Which you described to me?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   And is your understanding of that concept

          8         incorporated within the ABV valuation

          9         standards?

         10     A   So the standards provides the methodology that

         11         we need to follow as practitioners for

         12         preparing a valuation.  I can't recall if it

         13         specifically defines the willing buyer, willing

         14         seller in the standards.

         15     Q   Is your understanding -- again, we're going

         16         with your understanding of the concept of the

         17         willing buyer and seller standard.

         18     A   Yes.

         19     Q   Is that inconsistent with the valuation

         20         standards under the ABV?

         21     A   It's not inconsistent.  No, it's not

         22         inconsistent, but there's multiple standards

         23         that you could follow.

         24     Q   When you perform a valuation, which set of

         25         valuation standards do you follow?



                                                                  17


          1     A   Well, because I'm a CPA, I primarily follow

          2         the AICPA standards.  And, for the most part,

          3         they're generally consistent with the ASA.  But

          4         primarily because I am a CPA, I tend to follow

          5         the AICPA standards.

          6     Q   The AICPA standards, that's the ABV

          7         designation?

          8     A   Yes.

          9     Q   Have there been instances where you did not

         10         follow the ABV or AICPA standards in performing

         11         a valuation?

         12     A   Not that I can recall.

         13     Q   You always have followed the AICPA valuation

         14         standards?

         15     A   I don't know if I can say always, unless if

         16         there was a situation where the engagement was

         17         kind of outside of the scope, but I can't

         18         recall at this time.

         20             (Plaintiff's Exhibit 2 was marked.)

         21                       -  -  -  -  -

         22     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 2 which is a

         23         document I printed it looks like over the

         24         weekend from the AICPA website.

         25               Have you seen this information before?



                                                                  18


          1     A   I don't recall seeing this specific article,

          2         no.

          3     Q   The website that's listed at the bottom is

          4         AICPA.org.  Is that the AICPA website?

          5     A   Yes.

          6     Q   If you turn to the second page of the document,

          7         at the very bottom it says, "How to become

          8         accredited in business valuation."

          9               Do you see that?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   The first line says, "To earn the ABV

         12         credential, a candidate must hold a valid and

         13         unrevoked CPA license or certificate issued by

         14         a legally constituted state authority and pass

         15         the ABV examination."

         16               Are you telling me that that's no longer

         17         the case?

         18     A   No.  It was recently changed.  This article it

         19         looks like was written in 2015.

         20     Q   So that standard changed about a year,

         21         year-and-a-half ago?

         22     A   Yes.

         23     Q   If you flip to the third page, the first full

         24         paragraph, second sentence says, "Applicants

         25         must attest to meeting the Business Experience



                                                                  19


          1         and Education requirements and pay the

          2         credential fee."

          3               What's the credential fee?

          4     A   I don't remember what it was when I paid it.

          5         It was a long time ago.

          6     Q   Is it a one-time fee?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   Do you have to pay dues every year?

          9     A   Yes, you do.

         10     Q   What are those dues?

         11     A   I can't recall.  The firm pays the dues for

         12         everyone in the firm, so I don't even see the

         13         bills.

         14     Q   Can you give me a ballpark?

         15     A   Not offhand.  Because it's combined with my

         16         CPA dues, so it's all done in total.  I can't

         17         recall what the fee for specifically that is.

         18     Q   The business experience component of the ABV

         19         certification is six valuation engagements or

         20         150 hours of valuation experience within the

         21         preceding five years.

         22               Do you see that?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   Is that still the standard?

         25     A   I believe so.



                                                                  20


          1     Q   And the education component is 75 hours of

          2         valuation-related continuing professional

          3         education, is that right?

          4     A   I think that may have changed, actually.

          5     Q   What do you think it is?

          6     A   But it's close.  I think it may be 60 over a

          7         three-year period, but I think it may have

          8         changed.

          9     Q   Whether its 75 over a five-year period or 60

         10         over a three-year period, is that education an

         11         applicant must obtain before receiving the

         12         ABV credential?

         13     A   Yes.

         14     Q   After a person obtains the ABV credential, what

         15         are the ongoing CPE requirements?

         16     A   I'm sorry.  Maybe that's what I'm referring to.

         17         The 60 ours over a three-year period, so

         18         essentially 20 hours a year.

         19     Q   20 hours a year to maintain?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   What CPE programs have you participated in this

         22         year to maintain your ABV credential?

         23     A   Most of the training that I do comes from

         24         business valuation resources and then we also

         25         have some internal training as well.

          1     Q   What type of internal training?

          2     A   They are seminars that are taught by the

          3         directors or managers within our group.

          4     Q   What have the last three topics been that you

          5         can remember?

          6     A   The last three topics -- so I don't know if

          7         these are the last three, but some of the ones

          8         that I've done this year have been related to

          9         healthcare valuation, I did one on ESOP's and

         10         then one on divorce valuation.

         11     Q   What is healthcare valuation?

         12     A   Valuation of a healthcare entity.

         13     Q   Turning back to appendix A of Bolder 1 which is

         14         your CV, on the second page you've listed a

         15         number of articles that you've published?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   Which of those articles were published in a

         18         peer reviewed journal?

         19     A   I believe the Ambulatory Surgery Center

         20         Associate Journal is peer reviewed.  I'm not

         21         sure about the Cleveland Bar Journal or the

         22         M.D. News, Ohio Lawyer.

         23     Q   So your article titled Key Trends in ASC

         24         Valuation may have been peer reviewed?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  22


          1     Q   But you're not aware of any others being peer

          2         reviewed?

          3     A   I'm not sure if the other journals are peer

          4         review.

          5     Q   Have you published any articles regarding the

          6         valuation of business entities?

          7     A   Not that I'm aware of, other than just the

          8         valuation of intangible assets and then the Key

          9         Trends in ASC Valuation.  So ASC's are

         10         entities, they're ambulatory surgery centers.

         11     Q   What's an intangible asset?

         12     A   An asset that's not tangible.

         13     Q   Can you give me an example?

         14     A   Yes.  Like a copyright or a trademark.

         15     Q   We're looking at page 2 of appendix A.  Are

         16         these all of the articles that you've

         17         published?  Is this up to date?

         18     A   Yes.

         19     Q   Do any of these publications discuss a

         20         valuation under Delaware law?

         21     A   I don't believe so, no.

         22     Q   In the Course Instruction/Lectures section are

         23         there any courses you've taught regarding

         24         valuation under Delaware law?

         25     A   No.



                                                                  23


          1     Q   Since 2000 have you performed a valuation of a

          2         Delaware entity?

          3     A   I may have.  I can't recall at this time.

          4     Q   You don't specifically recall doing that?

          5     A   Not that I recall.

          6                        -  -  -  -  -

          7             (Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 was marked.)

          8                       -  -  -  -  -

          9     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 3.  Have you

         10         seen this document before?

         11     A   I may have.  I can't recall.

         12     Q   When do you think you may have seen it, if you

         13         did?

         14     A   I can't recall, actually.

         15     Q   Would you turn to page 2.  Do you see paragraph

         16         2 in the middle of the page?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   It says, "In accordance with the deadlines

         19         agreed upon in the scheduling order to be

         20         entered in the litigation, each report

         21         submitted by any expert shall include, at a

         22         minimum, the following."

         23               Do you see that?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   Would you turn to subparagraph G of that



                                                                  24


          1         section on the next page?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   It says, "A listing of any other litigations in

          4         which the Expert has submitted an expert report

          5         or has testified as an expert at trial or any

          6         hearing or by deposition, within the preceding

          7         five years."

          8               Do you see that?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   Did you do that?

         11     A   I don't think so.

         12     Q   Is there a reason why you didn't do that?

         13     A   Well, I haven't testified as an expert in a

         14         hearing or by deposition in the past five

         15         years.

         16     Q   Have you submitted an expert report?

         17     A   I have for divorce proceedings, but they never

         18         -- they ended up settling.

         19     Q   Have you done that within the last five years?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   Would you be able to provide for me a list of

         22         those engagements within the last five years?

         23     A   Yes.  I probably could get a list.

         24     Q   And it's your understanding those reports

         25         related to divorce proceedings, is that right?



                                                                  25


          1     A   Yes.

          2     Q   Any others?

          3     A   There may have been an income damage report

          4         within the past five years.  I would have to

          5         check my case list and see.

          6     Q   How long would that case list be?

          7     A   How long ago?

          8     Q   No.  How many entries would you estimate are on

          9         that case list?

         10     A   Going back to when, just five years?

         11     Q   Five years.

         12     A   I can't recall.  I switched firms, so I can't

         13         recall.

         14     Q   Is Metheney one of those damage reports?

         15     A   Yes.

         16                        -  -  -  -  -

         17             (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 was marked.)

         18                       -  -  -  -  -

         19     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 4.  Do you

         20         recognize the substance of this document?

         21     A   Yes.

         22     Q   What is it?

         23     A   It was a report reviewing an expert's report.

         24     Q   It was a rebuttal report?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  26


          1     Q   From June 2018?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   I noted your hourly rate in this report is

          4         $365.

          5               Do you see that?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   That's higher than your hourly rate in this

          8         case?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   What's the reason for the discrepancy?

         11     A   There is no discrepancy.  My rate just changed.

         12     Q   That was a bad word.  Difference.

         13     A   Right.

         14     Q   Your rate changed?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   Is $355 your current standard rate?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   I think you already said this, so I apologize

         19         for repeating myself, but you have not

         20         testified as an expert in any court before?

         21     A   So there was a case back when I first started,

         22         but it was I think a fact witness rather than

         23         an expert report.

         24     Q   So let me ask a better question.

         25               Is it correct that in an expert capacity



                                                                  27


          1         you have not testified in a court before?

          2     A   That's correct.

          3     Q   And that would include trial testimony?

          4     A   That's correct.

          5     Q   And deposition testimony?

          6     A   That's correct.

          7     Q   Has any expert report you've submitted been

          8         held inadmissible by a judge?

          9     A   Inadmissible, no.

         10     Q   Has any expert report you've submitted been

         11         considered unreliable by a judge?

         12     A   Not that I can recall, no.

         13     Q   Do you recall any criticism of any report by a

         14         judge?

         15     A   By a judge?  Not that I can recall.

         16     Q   By any other person?

         17     A   Well, I've had people perform rebuttals of my

         18         reports, cases.

         19     Q   Have any of your expert engagements related to

         20         litigation involved the valuation of limited

         21         partnership interests?

         22     A   Litigation?  I can't recall at this time.

         23     Q   Have any of your expert engagements for

         24         purposes of litigation involved the valuation

         25         of private equity fund interests?



                                                                  28


          1     A   I can't recall.

          2     Q   Would reviewing your case list that you

          3         referred to help to refresh your recollection

          4         on that?

          5     A   Yes, it would.

          6     Q   Is that list something that's already put

          7         together that could be printed since we're all

          8         here at your office?

          9     A   I don't work out of this office.

         10     Q   What was the subject of the report in the

         11         Metheney case?

         12     A   The expert provided a report of potential

         13         damages related to the Metheney matter.

         14     Q   And that was expenses related to a knee

         15         amputation?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   On page 2 of Bolder 4 which we're looking at

         18         there's a heading called Summary of My Opinion.

         19               Do you see that?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   In the first sentence you wrote that, "The

         22         Zak report does not provide the level of detail

         23         and support normally provided in an expert

         24         report."

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  29


          1     Q   Describe for me the level of detail and support

          2         that's normally provided in an expert report.

          3     A   The schedules that detail the calculations that

          4         form the basis of their opinion.

          5     Q   So you're saying if an expert provides a

          6         calculation, they need to support that in some

          7         way?

          8     A   Well, in this case he needed to provide the

          9         calculations, which he didn't do.

         10     Q   What do you mean by calculation?

         11     A   His schedules.

         12     Q   Why is it important for an expert to provide

         13         calculations?

         14     A   Well, if I'm going to review his numbers, it's

         15         difficult to do that if I don't have the

         16         calculations.

         17     Q   In the last sentence, same paragraph, you

         18         wrote, "The Zak report contains a series of

         19         omissions and commissions that, when taken

         20         collectively, render the analysis, conclusions,

         21         and opinions both unreliable and not credible."

         22               Do you see that?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   I read the same sentence in your report in this

         25         matter.  Is that standard rebuttal report



                                                                  30


          1         language for CBIZ?

          2     A   No.  It's not standard rebuttal report language

          3         for CBIZ.

          4     Q   Is it for you?

          5     A   Is it standard language?  No.

          6     Q   Is it just a coincidence that it's the same

          7         language in both reports?

          8     A   A coincidence, probably.

          9     Q   If you turn to the next page, page 3 of Bolder

         10         Exhibit 4 --

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   -- there's a heading called Review of Mr. Zak's

         13         Report.

         14               Do you see that?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   In the very last sentence of that first

         17         paragraph you stated, "Mr. Zak does not hold

         18         any degrees or certifications which demonstrate

         19         knowledge of accounting, finance or economics."

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   Was Mr. Zak's report excluded in that case

         22         based on any degrees or certifications he had

         23         obtained?

         24     A   No.  Because the case was settled.

         25     Q   Did the case settle before trial?



                                                                  31


          1     A   Yes.

          3             (Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 was marked.)

          4                       -  -  -  -  -

          5     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 5.  Do you

          6         recognize the substance of this document?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   What is it?

          9     A   What is what?

         10     Q   What's reflected in Bolder 5?

         11     A   This is an addendum to the Metheney matter.

         12     Q   So this is a supplemental report that you

         13         submitted?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   What was the reason for submitting a

         16         supplemental report?

         17     A   Dr. Zak provided additional information.

         18     Q   After you had submitted your original expert

         19         report?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   In your experience as an expert is it unusual

         22         or uncommon to submit a supplemental report

         23         after additional information is obtained?

         24     A   Is it unusual?  No.

         25     Q   Who engaged CBIZ in this matter?



                                                                  32


          1     A   In which matter?

          2     Q   This Daugherty versus Highland matter.

          3     A   Oh.  In this matter, the Metheney matter?

          4     Q   Daugherty.  The case we're here to talk about.

          5     A   Highland Capital.

          6     Q   Were you approached by Highland Capital?

          7     A   No.  They reached out to our valuation group.

          8     Q   Who in the valuation group?

          9     A   I believe it was Rick Jensen that got the

         10         initial communication.

         11     Q   Where is Mr. Jensen located?

         12     A   He is in our Dallas office.

         13     Q   Have you worked, you personally worked with

         14         Highland Capital before?

         15     A   No, I haven't.

         16     Q   Have you worked with DLA Piper before?

         17     A   No.

         18     Q   Has Mr. Jensen worked with Highland Capital

         19         before?

         20     A   I think he has, yes.

         21     Q   How many currently pending engagements does

         22         CBIZ have with Highland Capital?

         23     A   I don't know.

         24     Q   More than this one?

         25     A   More than this one?  I don't know.



                                                                  33


          1     Q   Is it correct that you are primarily

          2         responsible for this matter on behalf of CBIZ?

          3     A   Yes.

          4     Q   Are you working with anyone else at CBIZ?

          5     A   I had a staff person help review the

          6         calculations.

          7     Q   And that was I was going to say proofreading,

          8         but I don't want to devalue the work that was

          9         done.  It was essentially review of your work?

         10     A   Well, yes.  I mean we have a -- the valuation

         11         group has an internal review process, so yes.

         12     Q   Can you give me an estimate of the hours billed

         13         to date for this matter?

         14     A   About 25 to 30.

         15     Q   That is your time and anyone else's time on

         16         your team?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   You reviewed documents in connection with this

         19         matter, is that right?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   Would I find those documents in Bolder

         22         Exhibit 1?  Well, let me ask it a different

         23         way.

         24               What documents did you review for this

         25         matter?



                                                                  34


          1     A   I reviewed the documents that were produced

          2         that are cited by Dr. Wazzan.

          3     Q   You reviewed all of those documents that were

          4         cited by Dr. Wazzan or just some of them?

          5     A   I've reviewed all of the documents.  Some were

          6         in more detail than others because they were

          7         the basis of his calculation, but --

          8     Q   I'm looking at Appendix B to Bolder 1.  I think

          9         you are there with me, is that right?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   You reviewed every document listed in

         12         Appendix B?

         13                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Objection.  Form.

         14     Q   That was meant to be a question, not a

         15         statement.

         16               Did you review every document

         17         reflected --

         18                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Objection to

         19         form.

         20     A   I mean, yes, I looked at each of them.  But as

         21         far as spending in-depth review, it was mostly

         22         the documents that were the basis of the

         23         calculation.

         24     Q   Which of the documents listed on Appendix B did

         25         you give an in-depth review, as you put it?



                                                                  35


          1     A   So the audited financial statements of 2016,

          2         the capital account statements and then the

          3         document that detailed the reverse stock split

          4         for NexPoint.  So primarily the financial

          5         documents.

          6     Q   Which capital account statements did you

          7         review?

          8     A   So I reviewed the March 31, 2013 statement, the

          9         June 30, 2019 statement, the statements from

         10         2018 that are listed here and the statement

         11         from March 31, 2019.

         12     Q   You referenced the capital account statement

         13         ending March 31, 2013?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   That's listed under additional documents in

         16         Appendix B?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Why is that listed under additional documents?

         19     A   Because it wasn't cited in Wazzan's report.

         20     Q   Was it produced in the litigation before you

         21         submitted your rebuttal report?

         22     A   I don't know when it was produced in the

         23         litigation.

         24     Q   Is that a document that was provided to you?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  36


          1     Q   Did counsel provide that to you?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   Which counsel?

          4     A   You mean the specific person?

          5     Q   Sure.

          6     A   I think it was Crystal Woods.

          7     Q   Did you ask Ms. Woods for a copy of the

          8         March 31, 2013 capital account statement?

          9     A   No.

         10     Q   She just provided it to you?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   In the course of your review, did you look at

         13         each quarterly capital account statement, say,

         14         from March 31, 2013 to the present?

         15     A   The ones that I was provided with I reviewed,

         16         yes.

         17     Q   So you just looked at documents you were

         18         provided with?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Did you make any requests for documents in

         21         addition to those that were provided to you?

         22     A   I don't believe so.

         23     Q   Your universe of documents that you relied on

         24         for this engagement were documents cited in the

         25         Wazzan report or provided to you by Ms. Woods?



                                                                  37


          1     A   Yes.

          2     Q   In the course of your engagement did you

          3         conduct any interviews with any person at

          4         Highland Capital?

          5     A   No.

          6     Q   Did you speak with any person at Highland

          7         Capital?

          8     A   No.

          9     Q   Ms. Woods was your primary contact?

         10     A   Yes.  Well, and Michael.

         11                       MR. UEBLER:  Mr. Massiatte, while

         12         we're all together, did you all have an

         13         opportunity to submit your pro hoc papers?

         14         This is the second deposition you're

         15         participating in now.

         16                       MR. MASSIATTE:  I believe they're

         17         being submitted today.

         18                       MR. UEBLER:  Great.

         19     Q   Did you review any other documents not listed

         20         on Appendix B in connection with this

         21         engagement?

         22     A   I reviewed the document in Appendix C that

         23         showed the stock prices from Yahoo Finance.

         24     Q   Is that the only document that you reviewed

         25         that's not listed on Appendix B?



                                                                  38


          1     A   We did check the -- I didn't request the status

          2         because we have access to that ourselves, so I

          3         reviewed those on my own.  So things like that

          4         where I already had access to the data, like

          5         the treasury yields and things like that, we

          6         searched those on our own.

          7     Q   Publicly available information?

          8     A   Right.  Yes.

          9     Q   Are there any documents you requested from

         10         counsel or Highland and did not receive?

         11     A   I don't believe so, no.

         12                        -  -  -  -  -

         13       (Plaintiff's Exhibits 6 through 8 were marked.)

         14                       -  -  -  -  -

         15     Q   Dr. Bolder, you've been handed documents marked

         16         6, 7 and 8.  I would like to walk through your

         17         report and I thought it would be most

         18         convenient for us to have Dr. Wazzan's reports

         19         for reference while we do that.

         20     A   Sure.

         21     Q   Exhibit 6 is Dr. Wazzan's report dated July 26,

         22         2019.  Exhibit 7 is the track changes version

         23         of Dr. Wazzan's August 22, 2019 report.

         24         Exhibit 8 are Dr. Wazzan's August 22 updated

         25         exhibits with the summary sheet of changes on



                                                                  39


          1         the top which you're free to reference today if

          2         you would like to.

          3     A   Sure.

          4     Q   With or without referring to your report which

          5         is Bolder 1, would you summarize for me the

          6         opinions you have reached in this matter?

          7     A   Yes.  So I reviewed Dr. Wazzan's report and I

          8         noted several issues with the methodology that

          9         he used and several errors in his schedules.

         10     Q   Let's start with the issues regarding

         11         methodology.  What were those?

         12     A   So in his analysis in Exhibits 2 and 3 he's

         13         projecting -- I'm sorry -- he's applying a

         14         growth rate to the capital account balances in

         15         both exhibits and then discounting them back.

         16         And then so my opinion was that that was

         17         speculative given that there were capital

         18         account statements and financial statements

         19         within a close proximity of his valuation dates

         20         that were available.

         21     Q   Are you offering an opinion regarding the

         22         methodology that Mr. Wazzan should have used?

         23     A   I am stating that I thought that the

         24         methodology that he used was unnecessarily

         25         speculative.



                                                                  40


          1     Q   Why was it unnecessarily speculative?

          2     A   Because he's estimating the capital account

          3         balances for his valuation dates when there are

          4         statements available in close proximity to

          5         those dates.  And there's several subjective

          6         parts to that analysis as far as the growth

          7         rate, discount rate and also the time period

          8         for the projection.

          9     Q   I'll ask some more detailed questions about

         10         that as we go but, at a high level, what

         11         methodology would you have used instead?

         12     A   I would have used what's typically referred to

         13         as the net asset value methodology where if you

         14         have a capital account statement where the

         15         assets and liabilities are presented at fair

         16         value, then it would be just looking at the

         17         ownership percentage of the capital account.

         18         So to sum it up, it would be more of a net

         19         asset approach versus a projection.

         20     Q   I don't want to oversimplify this, but would

         21         you have taken the reported fair value of the

         22         assets and then just multiplied it by the

         23         interest of a particular limited partner?  Is

         24         that the methodology?

         25     A   No.  I would not have taken a percentage of the



                                                                  41


          1         fair value of the assets.  So the net asset

          2         value method would be more so taking a

          3         percentage of the capital account balance, not

          4         the value of the assets.

          5     Q   Understood.

          6     A   And he actually performed the same approach,

          7         but he projected the capital account balance.

          8     Q   Using a quarterly Statement of Capital Account,

          9         is that right?

         10     A   Do you mean for his growth rate?

         11     Q   Yeah.

         12     A   Yeah.  So the growth rate came from the capital

         13         account statement.

         14     Q   Is it your opinion that he should have instead

         15         used the data provided in audited financial

         16         statements?

         17     A   For which date?

         18     Q   Let's say ending 2016.

         19     A   Yes.  Based on my review of his original

         20         report, yes.

         21     Q   All right.  So we've identified that critique

         22         of his methodology.  What other opinions are

         23         you offering regarding the Wazzan methodology?

         24     A   Well, in addition to that, also the use of the

         25         weighted average beta without any additional



                                                                  42


          1         analysis for support and then the discounting

          2         of the projected capital balance back to the

          3         valuation date.

          4     Q   Do you know what the account fund termination

          5         date is for RCP?

          6     A   No.

          7     Q   Did you ask?

          8     A   No.

          9     Q   Why not?

         10     A   I didn't believe it was relevant to what I was

         11         asked to do.

         12     Q   Why not?

         13     A   Because I didn't feel there was a reasonable

         14         basis for projecting the capital account

         15         balance to the fund termination date.

         16     Q   Apart from your critique of the Wazzan

         17         methodology, do you challenge the estimated

         18         termination date that Dr. Wazzan used?

         19     A   I don't have any basis for saying if it's right

         20         or wrong.

         21     Q   We left off with your critique of his

         22         discounting the projected capital balance.

         23         What other critique are you making of the

         24         Wazzan methodology?

         25     A   Well, it's primarily the method of projecting



                                                                  43


          1         the capital account.  I mean there were other

          2         issues where I felt that he didn't provide

          3         enough support for the method that he was

          4         using, but that's primarily the critique that I

          5         was making.

          6     Q   All right.  I'll do my best to walk us through

          7         each of those.

          8               Let's start on page 2 of the Bolder

          9         report?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   Under Summary of My Opinion you wrote that,

         12         "The Wazzan report does not provide the level

         13         of rigor normally provided in an expert

         14         report."

         15               First of all, what is the level of rigor

         16         normally provided in an expert report?

         17     A   I would have expected to see additional support

         18         for the assumptions and the methodology that he

         19         used which was not provided in his original

         20         report.

         21     Q   What would you have expected to see to support

         22         assumptions that you did not see?

         23     A   I'm sorry.  Could you repeat the question,

         24         please?

         25     Q   Sure.



                                                                  44


          1               You said you would have expected to see

          2         more support for assumptions and methodology?

          3     A   Yes.

          4     Q   What did you expect to see regarding

          5         assumptions that was missing?

          6     A   I would have expected to see references or

          7         sources supporting the assumptions.

          8     Q   Which assumptions?

          9     A   Should we go through the report and I can --

         10     Q   Feel free to go through it and list for me the

         11         assumptions that you felt were lacking in

         12         support.

         13     A   Okay.  So starting with the Cash In Escrow in

         14         his original report, he did not discuss how the

         15         5 percent adjustment was determined and he

         16         didn't provide the basis for that adjustment

         17         and didn't say why he used 5 percent versus

         18         another percentage.

         19               Moving to the Value of the NHF Shares,

         20         his initial valuation date was December 30, so

         21         there was no support for using that date in the

         22         valuation.

         23               And then moving to the Value of the

         24         Ownership in RCP, he didn't provide any source

         25         of his methodology for projecting the capital



                                                                  45


          1         account.

          2     Q   Let me stop you there.

          3               When you say, "Source for his

          4         methodology", you mean some sort of treatise

          5         citation or what would you be looking for

          6         there?

          7     A   Any reference materials that support the use of

          8         that methodology.  And then there was no

          9         support or rationale noted in the report for

         10         using the 10.8 percent growth rate for

         11         estimating future growth.

         12               Also the use of the weighted average beta

         13         based on the three industry level levered

         14         betas, there was no support for that analysis

         15         or why he chose to do that in his original

         16         report.  And then no support provided in his

         17         original report for estimating the percentage

         18         of RCP's ownership interest based on a percent

         19         funded.

         20               And then --

         21     Q   Explain that one to me.

         22     A   So he did an analysis based on, if I look at

         23         Exhibit 6, based on the capital calls, and I

         24         didn't see any support in his original report

         25         for doing it that way.



                                                                  46


          1     Q   In other words, you didn't see a basis in the

          2         factual record to calculate it the way that he

          3         did?

          4     A   I didn't see any basis at all for doing it that

          5         way.

          6     Q   Okay.

          7     A   There was nothing in his report that stated the

          8         rationale for that methodology.

          9     Q   Anything else?

         10     A   Just moving on through the report, there was no

         11         discussion of the rationale of calculating the

         12         interest on distributions at 5 percent over the

         13         FRDR.  And then just similar issues with the

         14         estimate of the value as of December 31,

         15         similar to the first analysis as of July.

         16               And then in that analysis there were

         17         errors in the calculation.  And I'm looking at

         18         the value of RCP to Mr. Daugherty, there was an

         19         error in the calculation of his discount for

         20         lack of marketability.

         21     Q   What was that error?

         22     A   So he stated that he used a 31 percent rate

         23         when actually in his calculation it was

         24         30 percent.  And then he also used an incorrect

         25         -- I'm sorry -- an incorrect risk free rate.



                                                                  47


          1     Q   Anything else?

          2     A   I think that captures the substance.

          3     Q   You guys agree on the calculation of pre and

          4         post-judgement interest with respect to the

          5         2.6 Texas judgement, right?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   We'll set that aside for today at least.

          8               When you say on page 2 of the Bolder

          9         report under Summary of My Opinion that, "The

         10         Wazzan report does not conform to generally

         11         recognized standards", which standards are you

         12         referring to?

         13     A   Valuation standards.

         14     Q   Whose valuation standards?

         15     A   There's several out there, but probably

         16         primarily the AICPA standards.  The standards

         17         that you follow depend on the certifications

         18         that you hold.

         19     Q   Must you hold valuation certifications to be

         20         able to render a reliable valuation opinion?

         21     A   I don't know if I can answer that.

         22     Q   Is it your position that Dr. Wazzan isn't

         23         qualified to offer an opinion of value?

         24     A   I don't know that I can answer that question.

         25     Q   Why not?



                                                                  48


          1     A   Because I don't know what training he's had in

          2         valuation.  Without any certifications or

          3         without any discussion of his training, I can't

          4         answer that question.

          5     Q   Did you review Dr. Wazzan's CV?

          6     A   I did.

          7     Q   And so you're saying that without a

          8         certification such as ABV, you just don't

          9         know if he's qualified?

         10     A   No.  I'm saying without any reference to any

         11         training in valuation he's had, whether it's

         12         ABV or otherwise, I don't know.

         13     Q   You said ABV or otherwise?

         14     A   Right.

         15     Q   What other type of valuation training are you

         16         referring to?

         17     A   Well, there's several organizations that offer

         18         valuation training outside of the AICPA and the

         19         ASA, but I didn't see any reference in his CV,

         20         if I recall, that listed any training that he's

         21         taken.

         22     Q   When you refer to training, are you referring

         23         to education apart from -- that's a bad

         24         question.

         25               I'm just trying to figure out what you



                                                                  49


          1         mean by training.  Are you talking about

          2         academic experience, degrees?

          3     A   I'm talking --

          4                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Objection.  Form.

          5     A   -- valuation specific training and classes.

          6     Q   But what types of classes?

          7     A   There's conferences.  There's seminars.  I mean

          8         there's webinars.  There's all types of

          9         valuation-related training.  And I didn't see

         10         any reference to any training that he's taken

         11         in valuation.

         12     Q   So for you to know whether Dr. Wazzan is

         13         qualified to testify as an expert, you would

         14         need to know a list of webinars that he's

         15         participated in?

         16     A   No.  That's not what I said.

         17     Q   Explain to me the relevance of webinars to

         18         Dr. Wazzan's qualifications to testify as an

         19         expert.

         20     A   So my reference to webinars had to deal with

         21         the form of valuation training.  There's

         22         webinars.  There's in-person seminars.  There's

         23         conferences.  There's several types of training

         24         in addition to webinars.  So I was referencing

         25         any valuation training that he's had, whether



                                                                  50


          1         it's webinars, seminars, conferences or

          2         otherwise.

          3     Q   And without that information you are unable to

          4         assess whether Dr. Wazzan is capable of

          5         rendering an expert opinion on value?

          6     A   That's correct.

          7     Q   Does one have to be a CPA to offer a reliable

          8         opinion of value?

          9     A   No.  You don't have to be a CPA.

         10                       MR. UEBLER:  Can we take a

         11         five-minute break?  Off the record.

         12                      (Recess taken.)

         13     Q   Dr. Bolder, are you aware of any authority of

         14         the Delaware Court of Chancery analyzing an

         15         expert's attendance at webinars or conferences

         16         or training sessions to determine whether that

         17         person is qualified to opine on value?

         18     A   No.

         19     Q   On page 3 of the Bolder report under the

         20         heading Valuation Credentials/Standards, in the

         21         first paragraph, halfway down you stated, "Some

         22         designations also require a minimum level of

         23         work experience, passing a comprehensive

         24         examination, and submitting a sample report for

         25         peer review."



                                                                  51


          1               Do you have any reason to think

          2         Dr. Wazzan's work experience is insufficient to

          3         make him qualified to opine on value?

          4     A   I don't know the answer to that because I'm not

          5         sure what percentage of his work experience

          6         pertains to valuation.

          7     Q   You sat through his deposition on Friday,

          8         didn't you?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   Do you recall what his testimony was?

         11     A   I don't recall.

         12     Q   You reviewed his CV?

         13     A   Yes.

         14     Q   Did you find any peer reviewed publications

         15         listed on his CV?

         16     A   Yes.  I do believe he indicated that some of

         17         the publications were peer reviewed.

         18     Q   So what additional information would you need

         19         to determine whether Dr. Wazzan is qualified to

         20         render an expert opinion?

         21     A   Well, as I mentioned, the level of valuation

         22         training that he's had.

         23     Q   Anything else?

         24     A   It would probably be helpful to know what

         25         specific types of valuation engagements he's



                                                                  52


          1         worked on in the past.

          2     Q   Did you hear about any of that on Friday during

          3         his deposition?

          4     A   I believe so.  I don't recall the extent

          5         though.  I would have to look at the record and

          6         see exactly what he said.  But I didn't have

          7         that information at the time of writing my

          8         report.

          9     Q   But even after sitting through Dr. Wazzan's

         10         deposition on Friday, are you maintaining your

         11         position that it's not possible to determine

         12         the extent of his valuation training, if any,

         13         which is essential in evaluating the

         14         credibility of a valuation opinion?

         15     A   I don't recall if he mentioned what valuation

         16         training he had.

         17     Q   In the same section of your report you compare

         18         the definitions of the calculation engagement

         19         and valuation engagement?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   And that's based on the Statement on Standards

         22         For Valuation Services No. 1, is that right?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   And that's the AICPA that issued those?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  53


          1     Q   Based on your review of the Wazzan report and

          2         sitting in on Dr. Wazzan's deposition, is it

          3         your view that he's offering a calculation

          4         engagement or a valuation engagement in this

          5         matter?

          6     A   He states that he was asked to calculate the

          7         value.

          8     Q   I understand that you quoted on page 3 of your

          9         report that he wrote, "Calculate the value",

         10         but I'm asking you as a conceptual matter, do

         11         you believe Dr. Wazzan has a calculation

         12         engagement or a valuation engagement?

         13     A   I can only go by what he stated in his report.

         14         He stated that he was asked to calculate the

         15         value, not provide a valuation conclusion.

         16     Q   Let's turn to section B of the Bolder report on

         17         page 4 and start with Cash in Escrow.  Now, I

         18         understand from earlier that you are not

         19         offering an opinion on the value of the cash in

         20         escrow, is that right?

         21     A   That's correct.

         22     Q   Were you asked to calculate an alternative

         23         value?

         24     A   No.

         25     Q   How would you have calculated the value of cash



                                                                  54


          1         in escrow?

          2     A   I may have applied a similar rate to determine

          3         the value of the cash as of December 8 and

          4         July 26.  But without actually doing the

          5         analysis, I can't tell you what rate I would

          6         have used.

          7     Q   What would the options have been?

          8     A   There's several options.  I mean obviously the

          9         FRDR is one.  There's treasury yields.  But in

         10         order to determine I would have to do more

         11         analysis and research.

         12     Q   How about a market interest rate?  Would that

         13         have been an option?

         14     A   Yes.  It may be an option.

         15     Q   Why do you say may be?

         16     A   It just depends.  I would have to do more --

         17         I guess look into it more to determine what

         18         rate I would have used.  But it could be an

         19         option, just like the FRDR is also an option.

         20     Q   How would a market rate have differed from the

         21         rate that Dr. Wazzan applied?

         22     A   I don't know.  I don't know what the market

         23         rates are for the time period that he's opining

         24         to in his report because I haven't done the

         25         analysis.



                                                                  55


          1     Q   Could they have been higher than the rate that

          2         Dr. Wazzan applied?

          3     A   I don't know.

          4     Q   Where would you look to determine that?

          5     A   There's resources that we have, in-house

          6         reference materials, Bloomberg that we use

          7         in-house to determine market rates, but I

          8         haven't reviewed them.

          9     Q   Any sources other than Bloomberg that you could

         10         reference?

         11     A   There maybe others, but I don't recall off the

         12         top of my head.

         13     Q   You don't recall the names of the sources, is

         14         that what you're saying?

         15     A   Yes.

         16                        -  -  -  -  -

         17             (Plaintiff's Exhibit 9 was marked.)

         18                       -  -  -  -  -

         19     Q   One of your criticisms of Dr. Wazzan is that

         20         he applied a rate of 5 percent over the

         21         Federal Reserve discount rate, is that right?

         22     A   Yes.

         23     Q   And that he didn't provide support or

         24         documentation for that?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  56


          1     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 9.  I'll

          2         represent it's a printout of a statute in

          3         Delaware, 6 Delaware Code Section 2301.

          4               Are you familiar with this statute?

          5     A   No.

          6     Q   Have you ever calculated interest pursuant to

          7         this statute?

          8     A   No.

          9     Q   Are you offering an opinion in this matter

         10         regarding whether the Court should apply this

         11         statute in determining the amount of any

         12         damages?

         13     A   No.

         14     Q   Have you ever applied -- are you familiar with

         15         the concept of a statutory rate of interest?

         16     A   In general.

         17     Q   Have you ever heard the term legal rate of

         18         interest?

         19     A   I've heard the term.

         20     Q   In any of your expert valuation engagements

         21         related to litigation or not, have you applied

         22         a statutory rate of interest?

         23     A   I don't recall.

         24     Q   Let's just wrap up this section on Cash in

         25         Escrow.  Apart from the interest rate that was



                                                                  57


          1         applied, are you offering any criticisms or

          2         rebuttal to the Wazzan report?

          3     A   No.  Not apart from the interest.

          4     Q   Let's turn next to page 5 of the Bolder report

          5         and focus on the section called Value of

          6         NexPoint Credit Strategies (NHF) Shares.

          7               In the third sentence of that section you

          8         wrote, "The escrow agreement between Highland

          9         Capital Management, L.P. and Abrams & Bayliss,

         10         LLP (the Escrow Agreement) notes that the cash

         11         equivalent value will be such an amount to be

         12         updated at the end of each calendar month."

         13               Do you see that?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   As a matter of fact, do you know if that

         16         updated calculation actually occurred at the

         17         end of each calendar month?

         18     A   I don't know.

         19     Q   Did you ask?

         20     A   No.

         21     Q   Why not?

         22     A   I guess I was just more focused on Wazzan's

         23         calculation, so I didn't ask whether or not

         24         they were actually updating the amounts at the

         25         end of the calendar month.



                                                                  58


          1     Q   NHF is a publicly traded security, right?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   And you can find market valuation information

          4         on a daily basis, is that right?

          5     A   Yes.

          6     Q   But you submitted as Appendix C to your report

          7         the November 30, 2016 valuation, is that right?

          8     A   Yes.

          9     Q   What was the purpose of using November 30, 2016

         10         as the valuation date?

         11     A   Well, he calculated his value as of December 30

         12         and I assumed he was doing that because the

         13         amounts were updated at the end of each

         14         calendar month.  At the time that I wrote my

         15         report, I didn't realize that he had just made

         16         an error in his analysis.

         17     Q   If you turn to Bolder Exhibit 7 that we have

         18         here which is the track changes version of the

         19         updated Wazzan report --

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   -- you'll see on page 18, paragraph 66 that

         22         Dr. Wazzan corrected the date from December 30

         23         to December 8.

         24               Do you see that?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  59


          1     Q   Do you agree with Dr. Wazzan's change and that

          2         December 8, 2016 -- well, let me back that up.

          3               So Dr. Wazzan, his assignment was to

          4         value the shares as of December 8, right?

          5     A   Yes.

          6     Q   So assuming that that's the goal here,

          7         valuation on December 8, do you agree with

          8         Dr. Wazzan's use of the December 8 value?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   Okay.  So with his correction, we're in

         11         agreement and we can move on from that issue,

         12         right?

         13     A   Yes.

         14                       MR. MASSIATTE:  I just want to

         15         note for the record that to the extent counsel

         16         intends to examine Dr. Bolder in-depth, not

         17         superficially about surface changes, but

         18         in-depth about the amended Wazzan report dated

         19         August 22, 2019, it's the Defendant's position

         20         that we'll take up with the Court regarding the

         21         inappropriateness of the amended report as it

         22         relates to its submission after the parties

         23         agreed upon deadline for producing expert

         24         reports.  So I just am noting that for the

         25         record.



                                                                  60


          1                       MR. UEBLER:  Thank you.

          2     Q   We've got the Cash in Escrow out of the way and

          3         the NHF shares, so that leaves us with the

          4         RCP shares, right?

          5     A   Yes.

          6     Q   The first aspect of the RCP shares that you

          7         addressed in your report was the value of the

          8         existing ownership in RCP as of July 26, 2019,

          9         is that right?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   And I'm on page 5 of your report.

         12               July 26, 2019 was the date of

         13         Dr. Wazzan's report?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   In the first paragraph of this section you

         16         refer to the net asset value approach that you

         17         testified about earlier, is that right?  This

         18         is what you were referring to?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Explain to me how you would value RCP as of

         21         July 26, 2019 using the net asset value

         22         approach.

         23     A   That approach would involve looking at the fair

         24         value of the assets, minus the fair value of

         25         the liabilities, and then taking the ownership



                                                                  61


          1         percentage of the balance.

          2     Q   If you're valuing as of July 26, 2019, what

          3         resource would you look to to determine the

          4         fair value of assets minus liabilities?

          5     A   It would require having the balance, the

          6         capital amount balance either as of that date

          7         or as close proximity as possible to that date.

          8     Q   What's the closest calculated capital account

          9         balance to July 26, 2019 that you're aware of?

         10     A   I believe it's as of March 31, 2019, with the

         11         exception of the June statement that was

         12         recently produced.  But at the time of my

         13         report, it was the March 31 statement that I

         14         referenced in my report.

         15     Q   At the time of Dr. Wazzan's report it was the

         16         March 31 statement?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   And by the time you submitted your report, you

         19         had the June 30?

         20     A   Right.  Yes.

         21     Q   All right.  So taking the June 30 capital

         22         account statement, walk me through the net

         23         asset value exercise just as a theoretical

         24         matter.

         25     A   It would just involve taking the percentage of



                                                                  62


          1         that capital account balance, because I believe

          2         it's already stated at fair value.

          3     Q   June 30 is approximately 26 days before

          4         July 26.  Would you do anything to account for

          5         the difference in time or would you just take

          6         the June 30 value?

          7     A   Since that date is so close, I may not.  Like I

          8         said, it would just depend on the

          9         circumstances.  But I may not since it was just

         10         such a close proximity to the validate.

         11     Q   And what would you do with that value to reach

         12         -- you mentioned a percentage.  What percentage

         13         are you referring to?

         14     A   So we may -- I mean if we're just speaking

         15         hypothetically here since I haven't actually

         16         done the analysis, so if we're just talking

         17         hypothetically, I may have applied a growth

         18         rate for those 26 days.  But, you know,

         19         depending on any discussions I would have had

         20         with the client, whether or not they wanted me

         21         to do that extra work since the information was

         22         available in such close proximity to the date,

         23         I may not have done that.

         24     Q   So you could have applied a growth rate?

         25     A   I could have.



                                                                  63


          1     Q   You would have asked the client if they wanted

          2         you to do that?

          3     A   Well, I would have had some discussions about

          4         the different options of valuing as of that

          5         date and then, based on those discussions, I

          6         would have determined what course of action I

          7         would have taken at that time.

          8     Q   What are all of the different options that you

          9         could have presented to the client?

         10     A   We could have just used the statement as of

         11         June 30.  We could have applied a nominal

         12         growth rate for those few days since it's just

         13         a few days out.  We could have looked at the

         14         IRR's and the capital account statements and

         15         then maybe made some adjustments to those based

         16         on the trend in historical statements.

         17     Q   Explain to me that process of using the IRR's.

         18         What does that mean?

         19     A   The IRR's were presented in the capital account

         20         statements, so we could have looked at the

         21         trend and see where the trend was heading to

         22         try to come up with what a reasonable basis

         23         would be for projecting that out into the

         24         future.  But given that it was a few days out,

         25         I may not have made that additional adjustment.



                                                                  64


          1     Q   Are there any other options that you might have

          2         presented to the client?

          3     A   There may be, but not that I can recall at this

          4         time.

          5                        -  -  -  -  -

          6            (Plaintiff's Exhibit 10 was marked.)

          7                       -  -  -  -  -

          8     Q   You've been handed Exhibit 10 which is the

          9         June 30, 2019 capital account statement that we

         10         were talking about.  I just wanted to put it in

         11         front of you to help us through this

         12         discussion.

         13     A   Yes.

         14     Q   I want to go back to the idea of a growth rate

         15         using the IRR.  Is that an approach that you

         16         have used before?

         17     A   Not that I can recall.

         18     Q   You don't recall ever using an IRR to project a

         19         future growth rate?

         20     A   Not an IRR.  The net investor IRR from the

         21         capital statement.

         22     Q   I'm not focused on this statement.  I'm just

         23         saying generally have you ever used an IRR to

         24         calculate growth rate?

         25     A   I may have.  I can't recall.



                                                                  65


          1     Q   You don't recall doing that?

          2     A   I may have.  I can't recall specifically at

          3         this time.

          4     Q   Do you recall ever using historical data to

          5         project a future growth rate?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   Explain how that works.

          8     A   Well, it depends on the specific facts and

          9         circumstances.  We may look at historical

         10         growth rates, but that doesn't necessarily mean

         11         that that's what the growth rate will be in the

         12         future.  So it requires additional research and

         13         discussions with the client with regard to

         14         outlook.  I mean there's additional research

         15         that would go into that analysis.

         16     Q   What research is that?

         17     A   What the current growth rates are, the economic

         18         rates, inflation.  All of that kind of plays a

         19         part into the growth rate that we would use.

         20         So it just depends on the specific

         21         circumstances.  It depends on the time period.

         22     Q   In any valuation since 2000, have you taken the

         23         historic growth rate and used that as the

         24         projected future growth rate?

         25     A   I have if it was applicable for that specific



                                                                  66


          1         situation.

          2     Q   You were telling me earlier about the

          3         hypothetical options you could have presented

          4         to the client.  Would one of those include

          5         projecting out to the termination date and then

          6         discounting back?

          7     A   I, more than likely, would not have presented

          8         that option since we had capital account

          9         statements that were in close proximity to the

         10         evaluation date.

         11     Q   Is it your position that in no circumstances

         12         for purposes of valuing RCP as of July 26, 2019

         13         would it be appropriate to project out to a

         14         termination date and then discount back?

         15     A   I can't say under no circumstances.  I mean

         16         there may be one out there where that might be

         17         appropriate, but I can't think of one at this

         18         time considering that statements were

         19         available.

         20     Q   Is there any reason other than the fact that

         21         statements were available as of June 30, 2019

         22         that you're saying it wouldn't be appropriate

         23         to project the termination date and discount

         24         back?

         25     A   Well, that's not typically how you would value



                                                                  67


          1         an entity that's a holding company that doesn't

          2         generate revenue.

          3     Q   Why not?

          4     A   That's not a generally recognized methodology

          5         for that type of entity.

          6     Q   What authority are you relying on to make that

          7         statement?

          8     A   Well, there's numerous valuation texts and

          9         resources out there that discuss the asset

         10         value method and the methodologies that are

         11         appropriate for different types of entities.

         12     Q   Can you list one where I would find support for

         13         your testimony?

         14     A   Yes.  One is Business Valuation and Federal

         15         Taxes.  It's by Shannon Pratt and Judge Laro.

         16     Q   Any other?

         17     A   I'm sure there's others out there.  I can't

         18         recall at this time.  There's numerous

         19         textbooks on valuation.

         20     Q   If I look at Pratt, what am I going to find in

         21         there that supports your testimony?

         22     A   It will discuss that the asset approach and the

         23         net asset value method is relevant for holding

         24         companies.

         25     Q   But I'm not asking whether the net asset value



                                                                  68


          1         is relevant.  I'm asking for authority showing

          2         that the Wazzan approach of projecting to the

          3         termination date and discounting back is

          4         inappropriate.

          5     A   I'm not sure that I can answer that, because

          6         most of the texts reference the asset approach

          7         for that type of entity.  I can't recall seeing

          8         one that would reference the methodology that

          9         he used.

         10     Q   You've got Exhibit 10 in front of you.  I'm

         11         going to hand you my pen because I don't see

         12         one in front of you.

         13               Would you show me your math -- feel free

         14         to write on Exhibit 10 -- of how you would

         15         calculate net asset value of Highland Capital

         16         Management as of July 26, 2019?

         17     A   Well --

         18     Q   You could even just circle the numbers that

         19         you're referring to as we talk.

         20     A   So I would look at the ending capital balance

         21         of 18.7 million.

         22     Q   Okay.

         23     A   And look at the ownership interest based on

         24         that balance.

         25     Q   Ownership interest.  Are you referring to the



                                                                  69


          1         third line at the top, 14.76?  I'm still on

          2         Exhibit 10.  It says, "Ownership:  14.76."

          3     A   Yes.  But I believe that that is the 14.76

          4         interest, unless I'm mistaken.

          5     Q   Got it.

          6               So what you're saying is the ending

          7         balance reflects Highland's 14.76 percent

          8         interest as of June 30?

          9     A   I believe so.

         10     Q   And would that be your value as of June 30,

         11         2019, the 18.7?

         12     A   Yes.

         13     Q   But this is hypothetical and you're not

         14         offering an opinion of value, is that right?

         15     A   That's correct.

         16     Q   Did you undertake any investigation to confirm

         17         that Highland's ownership interest is, in fact,

         18         14.76 percent?

         19     A   No.

         20     Q   Friday during Dr. Wazzan's deposition I heard

         21         Highland's attorney represent that this

         22         statement, this capital account statement is

         23         generated by a company called SEI.  Do you

         24         remember that?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  70


          1     Q   Did you undertake any investigation to

          2         determine the source of these capital account

          3         statements?

          4     A   I did not.

          5     Q   Did you see any indication in the record of the

          6         documents you reviewed that supports the

          7         assertion that SEI produced these statements?

          8     A   I may have.  I don't recall at this time.

          9     Q   Let's assume that SEI produces these

         10         statements.  Do you have any understanding of

         11         where SEI's data would come from?

         12     A   No.

         13     Q   Would it be Highland Capital Management

         14         providing SEI that data?

         15     A   I don't know.

         16     Q   Back to Bolder 10, you see at the very top it

         17         says, "Fund status."  The first section is Fund

         18         Status, Commitment Summary.

         19               Do you see that?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   It says, "Commitment."  And then the next

         22         column is 19.9 million?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   What does commitment represent?

         25     A   I believe that that's their commitment to date



                                                                  71


          1         as of the date of this statement.

          2     Q   But what does that mean?  What is a commitment?

          3     A   The capital commitment.

          4     Q   Whose capital commitment?

          5     A   Highland Capital.

          6     Q   In the next row down it says, "Contributions."

          7         And then it lists 32.2 million.  What does that

          8         number represent?

          9     A   I don't recall exactly.

         10     Q   Are you saying you knew at some point and you

         11         don't remember now or you never knew?

         12     A   I remember seeing that in some of the documents

         13         that I reviewed, but I can't recall how that

         14         was defined at this time.

         15     Q   Did you ask anybody how that's defined?

         16     A   No.

         17     Q   The next row down says, "Recallable

         18         distributions."  And it lists 13.5 million in

         19         that column.

         20               Do you see that?

         21     A   Yes.

         22     Q   What's recallable distributions?

         23     A   I'm not sure.

         24     Q   Did you ask anybody what that means?

         25     A   No.



                                                                  72


          1     Q   A few rows down it says, "Net Investor IRR,

          2         10.1 percent."

          3               What is your understanding of net

          4         investor IRR?

          5     A   That that is the cumulative IRR as of the date

          6         of this statement.

          7     Q   Right.  But what's IRR?  How is that

          8         calculated?

          9     A   Well, it's the internal rate of return, but I'm

         10         not sure how they may be calculating it for the

         11         purposes of this statement.

         12     Q   I can assure you that I have attended no

         13         seminars, webinars or conferences regarding

         14         valuation, so can you just explain to me how

         15         IRR is calculated?

         16     A   Well, it's basically just the return that's

         17         received on the investment that was made.  And

         18         there's different ways to calculate it, but

         19         it's basically looking at what was received

         20         versus what was put in.  It's just a simple

         21         calculation.

         22     Q   Can you determine looking at this how this net

         23         investor IRR of 10.1 percent was calculated?

         24     A   I haven't tried to calculate it from the

         25         schedule.  I would have to look at this in more



                                                                  73


          1         detail.  I haven't gone through that process.

          2     Q   What is net investor multiple 1.5x?

          3     A   I'm not sure how that's calculated.

          4     Q   You didn't speak with anyone at Highland to

          5         understand what's reflected on this capital

          6         account statement, is that right?

          7     A   No.  I did not speak with anyone at Highland.

          8     Q   You spoke with Ms. Woods?

          9     A   Yes, and Mr. Massiatte.

         10     Q   In the last paragraph on page 6 of the Bolder

         11         report you wrote, "It is my understanding that

         12         RCP's March 31, 2019 Statement of Capital

         13         Account is stated at fair value based on the

         14         fair value of RCP's investments."

         15               Are you with me?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   I assume then it's your understanding that the

         18         June 30, 2019 Statement of Capital Account is

         19         also stated at fair value?

         20     A   I assume so, yes.

         21     Q   What's the basis for your understanding?

         22     A   My discussions with Crystal Woods.  I did ask

         23         that question.

         24     Q   That question being whether the capital account

         25         statement reflects fair value?



                                                                  74


          1     A   The fair value of the investments, yes.

          2     Q   Did you ask any other questions related to the

          3         capital account statement?

          4     A   I may have.  I don't recall at this time.

          5     Q   Apart from what Ms. Woods told you, did you

          6         undertake any independent investigation to

          7         confirm that the capital account statement

          8         value reflected fair value?

          9     A   No.

         10     Q   You testified about this a little bit already,

         11         but I want to circle back to how, as a general

         12         matter, you project future value.

         13                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Object to form.

         14     A   In what instance?

         15     Q   Say, for instance, let's take stock of a

         16         privately held company.  How would you go about

         17         projecting future value say for purposes of a

         18         discounted cash flow analysis?

         19     A   So typically the client provides a projection

         20         and then we would look at it, review it, and

         21         then we would have discussions with the client

         22         what the future outlook would be for the

         23         company.  We would compare that to any industry

         24         or market research that we have related to that

         25         industry.  But typically for a discounted cash



                                                                  75


          1         flow analysis the company provides a projection

          2         that we review.

          3     Q   If projections aren't available -- not all

          4         companies create projections, right?

          5     A   Right.

          6     Q   So what information would you use in the

          7         absence of projections?

          8     A   We would work with the client to help develop a

          9         projection.  If -- well, it depends.  So

         10         there's different methods that you can use, but

         11         if the company isn't expecting any additional

         12         growth other than just inflationary growth,

         13         then we would just use an inflationary growth

         14         rate.  But if they're expecting their

         15         operations to be different than what they are

         16         currently, we would work with the client to

         17         come up with a projection, because that would

         18         need to be incorporated in the value.

         19     Q   Would IRR be one option of determining a future

         20         growth rate?

         21     A   For a privately held company we don't typically

         22         look at IRR.  We're using a risk free treasury

         23         rate.

         24     Q   What types of entities would you consider using

         25         an IRR for?



                                                                  76


          1     A   I mean we may use them for holding companies

          2         like this one, but typically for privately held

          3         operating entities, no.

          4     Q   Okay.  So let's take holding companies as the

          5         example then.  In your experience have you used

          6         an IRR to project a growth rate for a holding

          7         company?

          8     A   For the company itself, I can't recall, because

          9         that's typically valued using an asset

         10         approach.

         11     Q   In this instance you criticize Dr. Wazzan's use

         12         of a growth rate based on the IRR, is that

         13         right?

         14     A   I criticized his use of a growth rate, period,

         15         because there were statements available.  It

         16         wasn't necessarily because he used an IRR.

         17     Q   I'll make very clear this is hypothetical.  I

         18         understand your position.  But assuming you

         19         were to follow Dr. Wazzan's methodology, do you

         20         have a view as to what the IRR -- excuse me --

         21         do you have a view as to what the growth rate

         22         should have been?

         23     A   So hypothetically if I follow his methodology,

         24         so I mean I guess if we're just pretending, I

         25         don't necessarily have an opinion on what the



                                                                  77


          1         growth rate should have been because I would

          2         have needed to do some additional analysis to

          3         come up with an appropriate rate.

          4     Q   Am I correct that Dr. Wazzan first applied an

          5         IRR of 10.8 based on the March 31 statement and

          6         then revised that to 10.1 based on the June 30

          7         statement?  Is that your understanding?

          8     A   Let me refer to his amended report.

          9     Q   Sure.

         10     A   Yes.  He subsequently revised that to 10.1.

         11     Q   You told me a minute ago that more research

         12         would have been required for you to determine

         13         an appropriate growth rate in our hypothetical,

         14         pretend scenario.  What research would be

         15         necessary?

         16     A   For this entity or just an entity in general?

         17     Q   This entity, this valuation.

         18     A   Well, I would have looked at the historical

         19         trends in the IRR and then I probably would

         20         have looked at the investments that were

         21         included within the entity and looked at how

         22         those were trending too just to come up with a

         23         reasonable basis for the growth rate.

         24     Q   So you would have looked at IRR?

         25     A   In addition to other factors.



                                                                  78


          1     Q   And so far the other factors I've heard are the

          2         trends of the investments of the holding

          3         company?

          4     A   The trends of the historical IRR and then also

          5         the trends of the investments and those values

          6         over time.

          7     Q   Any other factors you would have considered?

          8     A   I may have considered other factors.  I can't

          9         recall.  I mean I can't think of any at this

         10         time.

         11     Q   Would you turn back to Bolder Exhibit 6, which

         12         is the original Wazzan report?

         13     A   Okay.

         14     Q   Earlier I believe we looked at Exhibit 2 and

         15         Exhibit 3?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   Again, I understand your disagreement with the

         18         Wazzan methodology, but in our hypothetical

         19         pretend world where we follow the Wazzan

         20         methodology, do you have any specific criticism

         21         of Dr. Wazzan's WACC calculation, W A C C?

         22     A   For which date?

         23     Q   Let's start with July 26, 2019.

         24     A   Only that he didn't provide the support that I

         25         would have expected to see for the beta



                                                                  79


          1         calculation.

          2     Q   Just to be clear, I'm looking at Exhibit 4 now.

          3         Is that where you are?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   Exhibit 4 of Exhibit 6 which is the Wazzan

          6         report, right?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   So you're telling me that you wanted to see

          9         more support for the beta, is that right?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   Do you have any other specific criticism of the

         12         approach or the analysis that's reflected in

         13         Exhibit 4?

         14     A   I just noted that he has an incorrect tax rate

         15         listed on his schedule, but no specific

         16         criticism of the approach.

         17     Q   The tax rate was listed as 35 percent, is that

         18         right?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   You noted in your rebuttal report that it

         21         should have been 21?

         22     A   Correct.

         23     Q   In Dr. Wazzan's supplemental report that was

         24         changed to 21, is that right?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  80


          1     Q   What difference in the calculation did the

          2         change make from 35 to 21?

          3     A   It didn't make a change in the calculation.  I

          4         was merely noting that he had an error in his

          5         schedule.

          6     Q   But the tax rate was effectively irrelevant for

          7         purposes of this calculation, right?

          8     A   Yes.  It was not the substance of the

          9         calculation.  He just had an error in his

         10         schedule.

         11     Q   What support for the beta -- first of all, what

         12         is beta?

         13     A   So beta is a measure of risk essentially.

         14     Q   How is beta calculated?

         15     A   So there's an in-depth formula for calculating.

         16         I can't recite it at this time.  But it

         17         basically measures financial risk and business

         18         risk.

         19     Q   I'm not asking you to go through the details of

         20         a beta calculation but, at a high level, how is

         21         that risk measured?

         22     A   Well, at a high level, it's measured based on

         23         the volatility of the companies that are used

         24         to calculate the beta for specific industries.

         25     Q   So you have industry specific betas, is that



                                                                  81


          1         right?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   And then you have company specific betas?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   What's the difference between levered and

          6         unlevered beta?

          7     A   The levered beta includes or incorporates debt.

          8     Q   For purposes of this engagement you didn't

          9         conduct your own beta analysis, right?

         10     A   That's correct.

         11     Q   You're not offering an opinion regarding what

         12         beta Dr. Wazzan should have used?

         13     A   That's correct.

         14     Q   So what is your opinion or your criticism

         15         regarding Dr. Wazzan's beta of 1.22 in

         16         Exhibit 4?

         17     A   My criticism was that he didn't provide the

         18         support for the beta that he used.  It looks

         19         like he just pulled the data from Duff and

         20         Phelps and used it without any additional

         21         analysis.

         22     Q   What more analysis would you have needed to see

         23         to satisfy yourself that the beta was reliable?

         24     A   That he looked at the companies that were in

         25         each industry category and that he considered



                                                                  82


          1         the debt to capital ratios for each and

          2         determined that they were applicable in this

          3         specific instance.

          4     Q   The beta of 1.22 is based on industry level

          5         data, is that right?

          6     A   Yes.  Based on the industries presented in the

          7         calculation.

          8     Q   On Friday did you hear Dr. Wazzan testify that,

          9         in effect, the industry level levered beta

         10         would be equal to or higher than the company

         11         specific betas?

         12     A   Did he say the company specific betas?

         13                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Object to form.

         14     A   I don't recall.

         15     Q   What do you recall from Dr. Wazzan's testimony

         16         on Friday regarding --

         17     A   I remember him mentioning the process of

         18         levering and unlevering the betas.

         19     Q   What do you remember about that?

         20     A   That he referenced it in his testimony.

         21     Q   Do you remember what he said about it?

         22     A   Not verbatim, no.

         23     Q   Was it that the levered betas would be equal to

         24         or higher to the unlevered betas?

         25     A   I don't recall his exact words.



                                                                  83


          1     Q   Do you have a view on that, whether the levered

          2         betas would be equal to or higher than the

          3         unlevered betas?

          4     A   Yes.  Because an unlevered beta is simply an

          5         asset beta.

          6     Q   So you agree with that point?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   So back to Exhibit 4 of Exhibit 6, Exhibit 4 to

          9         the Wazzan report.  We talked about the tax

         10         rate changing from 35 to 21 and you looking for

         11         a more rigorous analysis of the beta of 1.22.

         12               Is there anything else reflected in

         13         Exhibit 4 that you would change in our

         14         hypothetical world where you followed the

         15         Wazzan methodology?

         16     A   No.

         17                       MR. UEBLER:  Off the record.

         18                       (Recess taken.)

         19     Q   Dr. Bolder, I'm turning back to the Bolder

         20         report which is Exhibit 1 and I'm on page 7.

         21         In the last paragraph you wrote, "Mr. Wazzan

         22         estimates the percentage of Highland Capital's

         23         RCP ownership allocated to HERA at 66.9 percent

         24         based upon the percent funded by Highland

         25         Capital through October 1, 2009."  And then you



                                                                  84


          1         cite the Wazzan report, Exhibit 6.

          2               Do you see that?

          3     A   Yes.

          4     Q   And earlier you told me that Dr. Wazzan didn't

          5         offer support, in your view, for the use of

          6         funding through October 1, 2009 for his

          7         analysis, is that right?

          8     A   Yes.

          9                        -  -  -  -  -

         10            (Plaintiff's Exhibit 11 was marked.)

         11                       -  -  -  -  -

         12     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 11.  Have you

         13         seen this document before?

         14     A   I can't recall if I saw this previously or not.

         15     Q   This is an Assignment Agreement dated

         16         October 26, 2009 by and among Highland Capital

         17         Management and Highland Employee Retention

         18         Assets, LLC, is that right?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Would you turn to Appendix B of the Wazzan

         21         report, documents relied upon?

         22     A   Yes.

         23     Q   Under the heading Agreements, the second entry

         24         is Assignment Agreement between Highland

         25         Capital Management, L.P. and Highland Employee



                                                                  85


          1         Retention Assets, LLC dated October 26, 2009.

          2               Do you see that?

          3     A   Yes.

          4     Q   I think you told me earlier that you at least

          5         skimmed all of the documents cited in

          6         Dr. Wazzan's report, is that right?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   What's your recollection of reviewing this one,

          9         Bolder 11?

         10     A   I probably skimmed it.  I don't recall.

         11     Q   Did you communicate with Highland regarding

         12         Bolder 11?

         13     A   Regarding Bolder 11, no.

         14     Q   Did you communicate with counsel regarding

         15         Bolder 11?

         16     A   No.

         17     Q   Would you turn to -- do you see the Bates

         18         numbers at the very bottom corner?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Would you turn to Bates number HCM 15197?  The

         21         very top of the page is titled Assignment.

         22               Do you see that?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   There's a number 1 underneath that and it says,

         25         "Highland Capital Management, L.P. (HCMLP)



                                                                  86


          1         effective as of October 1, 2009, hereby

          2         transfers and delivers 96.4 percent of HCMLP's

          3         October 1, 2009 funded ownership of its limited

          4         partner interest in Highland Restoration

          5         Capital Partners, L.P. unto Highland Employee

          6         Retention Assets, LLC."

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   Defined as HERA, do you see that?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   Is it your understanding that this is the

         11         document by which Highland transferred its

         12         RCP interest to HERA?

         13     A   Yes.

         14     Q   Do you see where it says in number 1, "96.4

         15         percent of HCMLP's October 1, 2009 funded

         16         ownership."

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   How would one calculate 96.4 percent of HCMLP's

         19         October 1, 2009 funded ownership?

         20     A   Well, I guess in this instance when I reviewed

         21         this I was looking at the capital account

         22         statement based on their commitment.  Does that

         23         answer your question?

         24     Q   Unfortunately, no.

         25               I understand you reviewed the capital



                                                                  87


          1         account statement provided to you by Ms. Woods

          2         and not produced prior to the date of your

          3         report, but my question is how would one

          4         calculate 96.4 percent of HCMLP's October 1,

          5         2009 funded ownership?

          6     A   Well, I guess I would look at the amount that

          7         was provided as of that date.  But, again, I

          8         didn't actually go through that process of

          9         doing that.

         10     Q   Why not?

         11     A   I wasn't asked to.

         12     Q   Were your methodologies limited to those which

         13         you were asked to undertake?

         14     A   My methodology -- I wasn't asked to do a

         15         certain methodology.  I was asked to review

         16         Dr. Wazzan's report.

         17     Q   Before I showed you Bolder 11 just now, had you

         18         ever seen this reference to 96.4 percent of

         19         HCMLP's October 1, 2009 funded ownership?

         20     A   I believe I did see it in a different document,

         21         but I can't recall which one as of this moment.

         22     Q   Did you see it in the Wazzan report?

         23     A   I may have.  I don't recall where or what

         24         section at this time.

         25     Q   You didn't undertake any investigation to



                                                                  88


          1         determine the funding of HCP as of October 1,

          2         2009, is that right?

          3     A   That's correct.

          4     Q   You didn't make any attempt to calculate the

          5         funding of RCP as of October 1, 2009, is that

          6         right?

          7     A   Other than just looking at the March statement.

          8         But I didn't perform any other calculations,

          9         no.

         10     Q   How did the March 31, 2013 statement inform

         11         you, if at all, regarding funding as of

         12         October 1, 2009?

         13     A   Because it shows the commitment by Highland

         14         Capital prior to the transfer in April.

         15     Q   Of April 2013?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   Would you turn back to Wazzan Exhibit 6.  Are

         18         you offering an opinion or any criticism

         19         regarding Wazzan's calculation of contributions

         20         and funding through October 1, 2009 as

         21         reflected in Wazzan Exhibit 6?

         22     A   Of the specific calculation and the math, no.

         23         The math works.

         24     Q   The math works, it's just a question of

         25         approach for you?



                                                                  89


          1     A   Right.  Yes.

          2     Q   Your approach, which we could talk about which

          3         is based on the March 31, 2013 statement

          4         provided by counsel, yields, in your view,

          5         approximately a 44 percent interest of HERA in

          6         the RCP investment, is that right?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   Dr. Wazzan's approach results in an

          9         approximately 66.9 percent interest, is that

         10         right?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   It's a pretty big difference, isn't it?

         13     A   Yes.

         14     Q   What's your understanding of why there's such

         15         a disparity between your percentage and

         16         Dr. Wazzan's percentage?

         17     A   Because that percentage that I reviewed was

         18         based on the Statement of Capital Account as of

         19         March 31, 2013 and he's looking at the capital

         20         calls and the percent funded through October of

         21         2009.

         22     Q   Do you have any reason to dispute that -- well,

         23         let me ask that a different way.  I'll start

         24         over.

         25               Based on the calculation that you see in



                                                                  90


          1         Wazzan Exhibit 6, do you consider that to be

          2         inconsistent with the terms of the assignment

          3         in number 1, Bolder 11?

          4     A   I don't know that I'm necessarily qualified to

          5         interpret this document and say whether or not

          6         it's consistent or not with what Dr. Wazzan

          7         did.

          8     Q   Well, the document, Bolder 11, number 1 under

          9         Assignment refers to funding as of October 1,

         10         2009.  Do you agree with me there?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   Exhibit 6 of Dr. Wazzan's report reflects

         13         funding through October 1, 2009, does it not?

         14     A   Yes.  Funded through October 1, 2009.

         15     Q   And that's based on the document produced by

         16         Highland, is that right?  Do you see the source

         17         there?

         18     A   Yes.

         19     Q   You said in your report -- back on page 7 --

         20         "Mr. Wazzan does not provide any support for

         21         estimating the percentage of Highland Capital's

         22         RCP ownership allocated to HERA based on this

         23         methodology."

         24               Does Bolder 11 provide support for the

         25         Wazzan estimate?



                                                                  91


          1     A   It provides -- it discusses the effective date

          2         of October 1, 2009.  So it does provide some

          3         rationale, I guess, for why he did it that

          4         way.

          5     Q   As a factual matter, are you aware -- let me

          6         back up.

          7               A few minutes ago you referenced an

          8         April 2013 transfer, is that right?

          9     A   Uh-huh.

         10     Q   Yes?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   Just for the record.

         13     A   Sure.

         14     Q   And that was a transfer of the RCP interest

         15         from HERA back to Highland.  Is that your

         16         understanding?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Are you aware of any transfers from HERA to

         19         Highland or anyone else of any RCP interest

         20         between the October 26, 2009 transfer in

         21         Bolder 11 and the April 2013 transfer?

         22     A   Not that I can recall at this time.

         23     Q   That was a long question, so let me try a

         24         shorter one.

         25               In other words, what HERA got on



                                                                  92


          1         April 26, 2009 -- let me try that again.

          2               What HERA got on October 26, 2009, as far

          3         as you know, HERA kept until it transferred the

          4         interest back to Highland in April 2013?

          5     A   I don't know.  I don't know that I could answer

          6         that question.

          7     Q   Well, you don't know of any reason to dispute

          8         that, right?

          9     A   No.  I don't know of any reason to dispute

         10         that.

         11     Q   You're not aware of any transfer of RCP

         12         interest by HERA prior to April 2013?

         13     A   I'm not aware, no.

         14                        -  -  -  -  -

         15            (Plaintiff's Exhibit 12 was marked.)

         16                       -  -  -  -  -

         17     Q   You've been handed Bolder 12.  The Bates

         18         numbers are Bolder 1 through Bolder 2.

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   On page 7 of your report, the same paragraph

         21         that we've been working from, you wrote, "Based

         22         upon my review of the RCP Statement of Capital

         23         Account as of March 31, 2013, HERA's percentage

         24         of Highland's capital balance in RCP is

         25         approximately 44 percent."  Is that right?



                                                                  93


          1     A   Yes.

          2     Q   There's a footnote in the middle of that

          3         sentence.  It's footnote 8 and it refers to

          4         "Statement of Capital Account for the period

          5         ending March 31, 2013."

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   My first question is which Statement of Capital

          8         Account are you referring to?

          9     A   The one for the period ended March 31, 2013.

         10     Q   Bolder 12 includes two Statements of Capital

         11         Account for that period.

         12     A   Bolder 12?

         13     Q   The one right in front of you.  So let's focus

         14         on the Bates numbers, Bolder 1.

         15               Do you see that?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   So that lists the investor as Highland Capital

         18         Management, L.P., am I right?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   And it states that Highland's ownership

         21         percentage is 6.58 percent.

         22               Do you see that?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   Now flip the page over.  It's double-sided.

         25         Now we're on Bolder 2.  And this is a Statement



                                                                  94


          1         of Capital Account for the period ended

          2         March 31, 2013.  The investor is Highland

          3         Employee Retention Assets, LLC and the

          4         ownership is 8.18 percent.

          5               Do you see that?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   So in footnote 8 of your report, which

          8         Statement of Capital Account are you referring

          9         to?

         10     A   I was referring to Highland Capital

         11         Management's Statement of Capital Account.

         12     Q   You were referring to the document identified

         13         as Bates number Bolder 1, is that right?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   In reaching your 44 percent figure, did you not

         16         consider at all the Statement of Capital

         17         Account ending March 31, 2013 for Highland

         18         Employee Retention Assets?

         19     A   I did not.

         20     Q   And, just to be clear, your 44 percent figure

         21         represents HERA's percentage of Highland

         22         Capital's balance in RCP, is that right?

         23         That's what you say here?

         24     A   The percentage of Highland Capital's RCP

         25         ownership allocated to HERA.



                                                                  95


          1     Q   Okay.  You put it in your report as HERA's

          2         percentage of Highland's capital balance in

          3         RCP, is that right?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   And you derive 44 percent solely from Bolder 1?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   All right.  You still have my pen, which is

          8         great.  I think it will be helpful.

          9               Would you show me the math that leads you

         10         to 44 percent number?

         11     A   Yes.  So it's adding the 8.9 million to the

         12         capital account balance of 10.6 million and

         13         then taking the proportion of the commitment of

         14         the 8.9 million of the total.

         15     Q   Can you just circle the two numbers that you're

         16         referring to?  I think it's the very top number

         17         and the very bottom number, right?

         18     A   Yes.

         19     Q   All right.  So walk me through it.  You add

         20         8.9 to 10.6, is that right?

         21     A   Yes.

         22     Q   And what do you get?

         23     A   It's approximately 19.5.

         24     Q   19.5?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  96


          1     Q   And then you divided 8.9 by 19.5?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   And what's that number?

          4     A   It's actually approximately 45 percent.

          5     Q   So the 44 percent was incorrect?  It should be

          6         45, at least based on this math calculation?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   Where would I find that calculation in your

          9         report?  Did you provide the calculation in

         10         your report?

         11     A   No.

         12     Q   And again we're looking at the document that

         13         Ms. Woods gave you, right?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   Did you ask Ms. Woods for a copy of all

         16         quarterly account statements for Highland

         17         Capital?

         18     A   No.

         19     Q   Did you ask Ms. Woods for copies of all of

         20         HERA's capital account statements?

         21     A   No.

         22     Q   If you were reviewing capital account balances

         23         or ownership percentages, wouldn't that have

         24         been helpful to have all of the quarterly

         25         account statements?



                                                                  97


          1     A   Yes, it would have.

          2     Q   Why didn't you ask for it?

          3     A   Because I wasn't doing an analysis.

          4     Q   Why is the March 31, 2013 Statement of Capital

          5         Account the one that shows us HERA's percentage

          6         of Highland's RCP interest?

          7     A   Because I believe that shows the commitment

          8         prior to the transfer I guess in my

          9         understanding.

         10     Q   What's your understanding based on?

         11     A   Just based on my review of the documents in

         12         this case.

         13     Q   Which documents lead you to believe that

         14         8.9 number was reflective of -- let me back up.

         15               So what do you contend or what do you

         16         believe the 8.87 number is?

         17     A   The amount that was committed as of that date.

         18     Q   As of March 31, 2013?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   By Highland?

         21     A   Yes.

         22     Q   Does this reflect HERA's portion of the

         23         investment?

         24     A   I believe so.  Yeah.  I believe that that

         25         related -- or maybe I'm not saying that



                                                                  98


          1         correctly, but I believe so.

          2     Q   You believe what?

          3     A   That that related to the amount that was

          4         committed as of that date by Highland Capital

          5         that was subsequently transferred.

          6     Q   Well, if you flip the page and look at

          7         Highland Employee Retention Assets Statement of

          8         Capital Account, what is this document showing?

          9     A   It looks like it's showing Highland Employee

         10         Retention Assets investor statement of RCP.

         11     Q   Do you see commitment, 11 million?

         12     A   Yes.

         13     Q   Whose commitment was that?

         14     A   Based on this statement, it looks like it's

         15         HERA's.

         16     Q   But you didn't factor that commitment in in any

         17         way in your calculation of 44 percent, is that

         18         right?

         19     A   That's correct.

         20     Q   Why?

         21     A   I don't have a reason as I sit here.  I just

         22         didn't consider it.

         23     Q   Did you review a Statement of Capital Account

         24         for Highland Employee Retention Assets for any

         25         period other than the one ended March 31, 2013?



                                                                  99


          1     A   I don't recall if that was part of the

          2         statements that I reviewed.  I know some of the

          3         capital account statements had multiple pages,

          4         so I don't recall if it was in there.

          5     Q   Let me ask a better question.

          6               So do you recall reviewing this Highland

          7         Employee Retention Assets Statement of Capital

          8         Account at all?

          9     A   I don't recall.

         10     Q   Seeing this now, what other documents do you

         11         think you would need to see or would you like

         12         to see to confirm your 44 percent figure?

         13                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Objection.  Form.

         14     A   What other documents would I like to see?  It

         15         would probably be helpful to have all of the

         16         historical statements that were available.

         17     Q   Historical statements showing contributions,

         18         funding?

         19     A   The commitment, yes.

         20     Q   Would historical statements showing

         21         distributions be helpful?

         22     A   I believe that they're included on the

         23         statement.

         24     Q   The distributions are included?

         25     A   Yeah.  The cumulative distributions under the



                                                                  100


          1         performance summary.

          2     Q   All right.  Let's try another math exercise

          3         then.  If you take let's start with Bates

          4         number Bolder 1.  So just to make this easy,

          5         I'm going to refer to it as the Highland

          6         Capital Statement of Capital Account and then

          7         I'll refer to Bolder 2 as the HERA's Statement

          8         of Capital Account.

          9     A   Okay.

         10     Q   So let's take cumulative distributions to

         11         Highland Capital.

         12     A   The 6.7 million?

         13     Q   6.7.  And let's add cumulative distributions to

         14         HERA, 17.5.

         15     A   So approximately 24.3 million.

         16     Q   All right.  24.3 million.

         17               So if you take the 24.3 total

         18         distributions, what percentage of cumulative

         19         distributions did HERA receive?

         20     A   So let me understand your question.

         21     Q   Sure.  Let me start over.

         22               As between HERA and Highland, what

         23         percentage of the total cumulative

         24         distributions reflected in Bolder 12 did HERA

         25         receive?



                                                                  101


          1     A   So based on the cumulative distributions

          2         showing in the HERA statement, based on the

          3         total that we just calculated of 24.3, that

          4         percentage looks like approximately 72 percent.

          5     Q   To HERA?

          6     A   If you're adding the HERA and the Highland

          7         together and looking at just the proportion of

          8         HERA based on the total, that proportion is

          9         72 percent.

         10     Q   Let's take a look at the ownership percentage.

         11         This is the third row of each of the capital

         12         account statements.

         13               Do you see that Highland's percentage is

         14         6.58?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   And HERA's is reported as 8.18?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   I won't make you do the math, but you're free

         19         to check my math.  The total percentage

         20         represented there would be 14.76 percent, is

         21         that right?

         22     A   I can see it's approximately 14 percent if

         23         you're adding the two together, the 6.58 and

         24         the 8.18.

         25     Q   I want to be precise about it, not approximate.



                                                                  102


          1         So if you want to do the calculation, feel

          2         free.

          3     A   Yes.  It's 14.8 percent.

          4     Q   Are you rounding?

          5     A   To one decimal point, yes.

          6     Q   Let's take it out to two.

          7     A   14.76.

          8     Q   All right.  Now flip back to Bolder Exhibit 10,

          9         if you would, the Deposition Exhibit 10.  It's

         10         the June 30, 2019 Statement of Capital Account.

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   As of June 30, 2019, Highland's ownership of

         13         RCP is being reported as that same figure,

         14         right, 14.76?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   So let's go back to Bolder Deposition Exhibit

         17         12.  These are the March 31, 2013 statements.

         18         I'm looking at the Highland one.

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   It's got an ownership interest of 6.58 percent?

         21     A   Yes.

         22     Q   And the ending balance is 10.6 million, right?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   So 6.58 percent is represented as 10.6 million.

         25         Do you agree with me there?



                                                                  103


          1     A   Yes.

          2     Q   Flip over to HERA's on the other side of the

          3         page.  HERA's ownership percentage is reported

          4         as 8.18 percent, higher than Highland's

          5         percentage, right?

          6     A   Yes.  It's higher than the 6.5.

          7     Q   But the ending balance is lower.  HERA's ending

          8         balance is 8.8.  Did I read that correctly?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   So HERA has a higher ownership percentage but a

         11         lower ending balance?

         12     A   Yes.

         13     Q   Did you investigate the reason for that

         14         discrepancy?

         15     A   No.

         16     Q   Is it your opinion that the ending balance

         17         represented on either one of these Statements

         18         of Capital Account reflects actual funding?

         19     A   As far as actual funding -- I mean I can see

         20         that it shows the commitment and the

         21         contributions and the distributions.  But as

         22         far as actual funding, I don't know the answer

         23         to that question.

         24     Q   The ending balance reported, is it your

         25         understanding that that's reflective of a fair



                                                                  104


          1         value of a portion of RCP's interest?

          2     A   That's my understanding, yes.

          3     Q   So when we were talking earlier about funding

          4         as of October 1, 2009, do you remember that

          5         from Bolder 11?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   Where on Bolder Exhibit 12 would I determine

          8         what the funding was as of October 1, 2009?

          9     A   I don't know.

         10                       MR. UEBLER:  Why don't we just

         11         stop now, take a break.

         12                      (Recess taken.)

         13     Q   I would like to pick back up where we left off

         14         with Bolder Exhibit 12.

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   Would the Court be able to determine by looking

         17         at Bolder Exhibit 12 Highland's funded

         18         ownership of RCP as of October 1, 2009?

         19     A   I'm not sure just based on this statement.

         20                        -  -  -  -  -

         21            (Plaintiff's Exhibit 13 was marked.)

         22                       -  -  -  -  -

         23     Q   Dr. Bolder, you've been handed Bolder Exhibit

         24         13.  It's called Assignment Agreement and it's

         25         dated April 30, 2013.



                                                                  105


          1               Is this the April 2013 assignment you

          2         referred to in your earlier testimony?

          3     A   Yes.

          4     Q   What's your understanding of the assets

          5         transferred pursuant to this agreement?

          6     A   It's referring to Exhibit A, so HERA's limited

          7         partnership interest in RCP and HERA transfers

          8         and delivers 5,424 shares of NHF.

          9     Q   Okay.  Number 1 under the assignment is the

         10         RCP interest, is that right?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   And this is HERA assigning its RCP interest to

         13         Highland?

         14     A   Yes.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  It's transferring

         15         HERA's limited partnership interest in Highland

         16         in RCP, yes, to Highland.

         17     Q   HERA's interest in RCP to Highland, is that

         18         right?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   There's a reference in number 1 under

         21         assignment to a capital account balance of

         22         9.5 million as of December 31, 2012.

         23               Do you see that?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   Did you review the HERA capital account



                                                                  106


          1         statement as of December 31, 2012 to crosscheck

          2         your calculation based on the March 31, 2013

          3         statement?

          4     A   No.

          5     Q   Why not?

          6     A   I don't have a reason.  It just wasn't part of

          7         what I did.

          8     Q   The capital account balance for HERA as

          9         reflected in Bolder Exhibit 12 is 8.8 million,

         10         is that right?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   Lower than the 9.5 million reported in the

         13         Assignment Agreement as of December 31, 2012?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   Do you know of any events between December 2012

         16         and March 2013 that might have effected HERA's

         17         capital account value?

         18     A   Well, I believe the activity in the account

         19         impacted the value because it shows the

         20         beginning balance as of January and then it

         21         shows the ending balance as of March 31.

         22     Q   So it lists the 9.5 million number you're

         23         referring to on Bolder 12 there?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   So what account activity occurred?



                                                                  107


          1     A   I can only go by what's listed here.  I mean I

          2         don't know other than the activity that's

          3         listed here.

          4     Q   Are you aware of any buyouts of HERA's unit

          5         holders between December 2012 and March 31,

          6         2013?

          7     A   I don't recall.

          8     Q   Do you know how the assignment under Bolder

          9         Exhibit 13 was reflected in the Statement of

         10         Capital Account for the period ending June 30,

         11         2013?

         12     A   June 30, 2013?

         13     Q   Yeah.  For the following quarter.  After the

         14         assignment occurred, did you review capital

         15         account statements for the next quarter?

         16     A   I don't recall if I reviewed the June 2013

         17         statement.

         18     Q   Was that statement provided to you?

         19     A   I don't see it listed in my schedule of

         20         resources produced.  So based on just looking

         21         at my appendix, I don't believe so.

         22     Q   Would a June 30, 2013 Statement of Capital

         23         Account for Highland have been helpful in

         24         trying to ascertain what exactly was

         25         transferred from HERA to Highland in April?



                                                                  108


          1     A   It may have been helpful.

          2     Q   I'm back on Bolder Exhibit 12, the March 31,

          3         2013 capital account statements.  Earlier with

          4         respect to the June 2019 statement we looked at

          5         net investor IRR.  Do you remember that?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   Bolder 12 shows a net investor IRR for Highland

          8         of 16.6 percent?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   And HERA's account shows a net investor IRR of

         11         14.8 percent?

         12     A   Yes.

         13     Q   Do you have any understanding of why there's a

         14         difference between Highland's and HERA's

         15         reported IRR?

         16     A   No.

         17     Q   Apart from the numbers reported in Bolder 12,

         18         did you review documents showing historical

         19         distributions from RCP to Highland or HERA?

         20     A   Not other than just the distributions that are

         21         listed on the capital account statements.

         22     Q   Right.  So apart from the capital account

         23         statement --

         24     A   No.

         25     Q   -- No investigation?



                                                                  109


          1     A   No.

          2     Q   All right.  I would like to look at -- let's go

          3         back to Bolder 1, which is your report, page 8.

          4         There's a section called Value of the RCP

          5         distributions as of July 26, 2019.

          6               Do you see that?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   In your view, was it an error for Dr. Wazzan to

          9         determine the value of the RCP interest using

         10         both value of the interest itself and

         11         historical distributions?

         12     A   I wouldn't say it's in error.  There was no

         13         support for that methodology.

         14     Q   For what methodology?

         15     A   For adding the value of the distributions to

         16         the projected value of the capital account.

         17     Q   Why wouldn't you add historical distributions

         18         to the capital account?

         19     A   Because there were statements available in

         20         close proximity to the valuation dates.

         21     Q   I understand that.  But why would you exclude,

         22         under any circumstances, the economic benefit

         23         of historical distributions?

         24     A   I'm not saying that the historical

         25         distributions should be included, because



                                                                  110


          1         typically -- and I can't confirm if that's the

          2         case here, but typically the distributions are

          3         already accounted for in the capital account.

          4     Q   Okay.  Well, let's look at what you are stating

          5         with respect to the value of the RCP

          6         distributions as of July 26, 2019.

          7               The first disagreement is the interest

          8         rate used, is that right?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   The interest rate used by Dr. Wazzan in this

         11         instance was the same that he used for the

         12         cash, right, the 5 percent over the Federal

         13         discount rate?

         14     A   Yes.

         15     Q   Apart from the interest disagreement, what

         16         other disagreements are you providing in this

         17         section of your report?

         18     A   The only other disagreement is that he did not

         19         provide support for the methodology that he

         20         used.

         21     Q   By methodology --

         22     A   Of adding the distributions to the capital

         23         account.

         24     Q   You're not offering any criticism of his

         25         calculation of the distributions?



                                                                  111


          1     A   No.

          2     Q   Would you turn to Exhibit 8 of Dr. Wazzan's

          3         report, which is Exhibit 6?

          4     A   His original?

          5     Q   Yes.

          6               Do you see at the very top you list

          7         distributions, April 1, 2013 through March 31,

          8         2019?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   There's a reference then to Exhibit 8-A?

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   I just want to confirm, apart from your

         13         challenge to the methodology itself, you're not

         14         offering any opinion regarding his analysis of

         15         the amount of distributions, is that right?

         16     A   That's correct.

         17     Q   Are you aware of any distributions that were

         18         made that are not reflected in Dr. Wazzan's

         19         analysis?

         20     A   Not that I know of.

         21     Q   If you're hypothetically analyzing the value of

         22         RCP as of July 26, 2019, you would not have

         23         given any consideration to historical

         24         distributions, right?

         25     A   I would not have given any consideration to



                                                                  112


          1         historical distributions unless they were not

          2         already reflected in the capital account.

          3     Q   Would you turn to Bolder 1, which is the

          4         June 30, 2019 capital account statement for

          5         Highland Capital?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   Where on Bolder 10 would I find historical

          8         distributions to HERA?

          9     A   To HERA?  I'm not sure.

         10     Q   That's where we're calculating income, isn't

         11         it, HERA's percentage and whatever this is of

         12         Highland's interest?

         13     A   Yes.  Sorry.

         14     Q   And I believe you said as long as you could

         15         determine distributions of the Statement of

         16         Capital Account, you wouldn't include them in a

         17         valuation analysis, is that right?

         18     A   I'm sorry.  Could you repeat the question?

         19     Q   Yeah.  Sure.  Let me start with the original

         20         question.

         21               Where on Bolder 10 would I find

         22         historical distributions allocated to HERA?

         23     A   So the statement lists distributions.  I can't

         24         just looking at this determine what was

         25         distributed to HERA.



                                                                  113


          1     Q   The next section of your report addresses value

          2         of RCP as of December 31, 2016.

          3               Do you see that?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   Halfway through the first paragraph of that

          6         section you stated that, "RCP's audited

          7         financial statements as of December 31, 2016

          8         present RCP's investments at fair value as of

          9         December 31, 2016 and RCP's partners' capital

         10         as of December 31, 2016 which is based on RCP's

         11         total assets at fair value less total

         12         liabilities."  Is that right?

         13     A   Yes.

         14     Q   Is it your opinion that to determine the value

         15         as of December 31, 2016, you would reference

         16         the partners' capital listed in the audited

         17         financial statement ending December 31, 2016?

         18     A   I would reference it, yes.

         19     Q   What else would you want to look at?

         20     A   Well, if there were any other allocations that

         21         would need to be considered, then I would have

         22         to include those as well.

         23     Q   What other allocations could there be?

         24     A   It depends.  It would depend on the

         25         interpretation of the partnership agreement for



                                                                  114


          1         the entity and it could be different for every

          2         entity.

          3     Q   Do you know if different partners of RCP have

          4         different fee structures?

          5     A   I don't know.

          6     Q   Do you know whether the statement of limited

          7         partners capital in the audited financial

          8         statement would account for differences in fee

          9         structures among partners?

         10     A   I don't know if it -- there may be additional

         11         allocations from the audited statements, but it

         12         would just depend.  I don't know.

         13                        -  -  -  -  -

         14            (Plaintiff's Exhibit 14 was marked.)

         15                       -  -  -  -  -

         16     Q   You've been handed Bolder 14 which is the

         17         audited financial statement of RCP as of

         18         December 31, 2016.  The number 10 is my

         19         handwriting from Dr. Wazzan's deposition, so

         20         you can ignore that.

         21               Is this the audited financial statement

         22         you're referring to in the paragraph that we're

         23         looking at on page 8 of your report?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   Would any differences in fee structure preclude



                                                                  115


          1         you from simply taking the listed amount of

          2         partners' capital and multiplying it by 14.76

          3         percent to get to Highland's?

          4     A   There could be.  It just depends on the entity

          5         and what the allocations are.

          6     Q   But in this case you don't know what those

          7         allocations are?

          8     A   No, I don't.

          9     Q   How did the Statement of Capital Account, the

         10         value of capital accounts as of December 31,

         11         2016 differ, if at all, from the amount listed

         12         in this audited financial statement?

         13     A   I don't know that I was provided a Statement of

         14         Capital Account as of December 31, 2016.

         15     Q   Would that have been helpful information to

         16         have?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Did you request that information?

         19     A   No.

         20     Q   Is your disagreement with Dr. Wazzan's

         21         December 2016 valuation effectively the same

         22         as your disagreement with Dr. Wazzan's July 26,

         23         2019 valuation?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   It's the methodology used by Dr. Wazzan that



                                                                  116


          1         you disagree with?

          2     A   Yes.

          3     Q   Are there any differences with your

          4         disagreement with the December 2016 valuation

          5         and the July 2019 valuation that you could

          6         highlight for me here?

          7     A   Yes.  He used the wrong risk free rate in his

          8         analysis when determining the December 31, 2016

          9         value.  And then he estimated the December 31,

         10         2016 capital account value for Highland

         11         Capital.

         12     Q   Okay.  With respect to the risk free rate, I

         13         think Dr. Wazzan acknowledged that error and

         14         fixed it in his revised report, is that right?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   And, again, with respect to the December

         17         valuation, you're not challenging the WACC

         18         analysis, is that right?  It's just the use of

         19         WACC?

         20     A   The use of -- I'm sorry.  I don't understand

         21         the question.

         22     Q   So you're not making a specific challenge to

         23         any part of Dr. Wazzan's WACC calculation, is

         24         that right?

         25     A   Not other than the error, no.



                                                                  117


          1     Q   And the challenge to the beta used is the same

          2         that we've already been over, right?

          3     A   Yes.  Correct.

          4     Q   You reference the growth of 2.8 percent from

          5         the beginning balance in 2016?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   You disagree with that?

          8     A   Yes.  I noted that it lacks sufficient support.

          9     Q   Why does it lack -- first of all, you're not

         10         challenging the mathematical exercise of

         11         determining the 2.8 percent growth during 2015,

         12         is that right?

         13     A   No.  Not the math, no.

         14     Q   What you're challenging is taking the beginning

         15         balance for 2016 and growing it at 2.8 percent?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   And why do you say that that approach lacks

         18         support?

         19     A   Because he's estimating the December 31, 2016

         20         balance when we have audited financial

         21         statements of December 31, 2016.  And also

         22         there was a decline in the value from January

         23         to March based on the statements that we've

         24         received, but he's still including a growth

         25         adjustment and it doesn't appear that he



                                                                  118


          1         considered the decline.

          2     Q   But you don't know what the capital account

          3         statements ended December 31, 2016 reflect for

          4         any limited partner, is that right?

          5     A   That's correct.

          6     Q   Presumably neither did Dr. Wazzan?

          7                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Object to form.

          8     A   I don't know.

          9     Q   Do you know if the December 31, 2016 capital

         10         account statements were produced?

         11     A   Not that I know of, because they weren't listed

         12         in the schedule of resources produced.

         13     Q   Did you ask counsel to see those documents?

         14     A   Which documents?

         15     Q   December 31, 2016 capital account statement.

         16     A   I did not specifically ask for that statement,

         17         no.

         18     Q   You noted a 14.1 percent decline in the first

         19         quarter of 2016?

         20     A   Yes.

         21     Q   What growth or decline was there in the second,

         22         third and fourth quarter of 2016?

         23     A   I don't know.

         24     Q   So you're saying here that he should have just

         25         taken the limited partners capital value in the



                                                                  119


          1         audited financial statement, Bolder 14, and

          2         multiplied it by 14.76 to get Highland's

          3         percentage?

          4     A   And he probably would have also needed to check

          5         to see if there's any additional allocations or

          6         adjustments that would have been needed for

          7         that value.

          8     Q   But it's 14.76 percent that you believe should

          9         be used when attempting to ascertain a limited

         10         partner's share of the partners' capital --

         11         excuse me -- when attempting to ascertain

         12         Highland Capital's?

         13     A   I believe that was their ownership percentage

         14         at that time.

         15     Q   What's that belief based on?

         16     A   The 14.76 percent.

         17     Q   What's that belief based on?

         18     A   The capital account statement.  I don't have it

         19         in front of me.

         20     Q   So Bolder Exhibit 10, for example?

         21     A   Yes.

         22     Q   It shows that Highland's ownership percentage

         23         is 14.76, is that right?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   Did you attempt to determine whether that was



                                                                  120


          1         an accurate ownership percentage?

          2     A   No.

          3     Q   Do you have any idea of whether that's an

          4         accurate ownership percentage?

          5     A   Just based on what's reflected on the capital

          6         account statement.

          7                        -  -  -  -  -

          8        (Plaintiff's Exhibits 15 and 16 were marked.)

          9                       -  -  -  -  -

         10     Q   I want to try to understand where these

         11         percentages are coming from and see if you can

         12         help me through that.

         13               Exhibit 16 that's been placed in front of

         14         you is the audited report for RCP as of

         15         December 31, 2015.

         16               Do you see that?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Would you turn to page 5 of that report?

         19     A   Yes.

         20     Q   Am I reading this report correctly that the

         21         limited partners' capital as of December 31 is

         22         122,103,000?

         23     A   Yes.

         24     Q   Would you then turn to Exhibit 15 that's been

         25         placed in front of you.  This is a packet of



                                                                  121


          1         the Statements of Capital Account for all of

          2         the limited partners of RCP as of March 31,

          3         2016.

          4               In the section called Capital Account

          5         Summary on the very first page there for

          6         CALPERS, do you see it says, "Beginning balance

          7         as of January 1, 2016."

          8     A   Yes.

          9     Q   That's 87,272,394?

         10     A   Yes.

         11     Q   Can we add up the beginning balance as of

         12         January 1, 2016 for all of the limited

         13         partners?

         14     A   So these are statements that are only for the

         15         limited partners?

         16     Q   Right.

         17     A   So I've added them up.

         18     Q   What number did you get?

         19     A   122,103,124.

         20     Q   So the number that you got by adding the

         21         limited partner balances from Bolder 15 equals

         22         the partners' capital reflected in the 2015

         23         audited financial statement?

         24     A   Yes.  Because they have the 12,535 that's

         25         listed as RCP under general partner.



                                                                  122


          1     Q   Right.  But just focusing on the limited

          2         partners' interest which you just added up,

          3         those numbers reconcile, right?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   So if you take Highland Capital Management's

          6         beginning balance as of January 1, 2016 as

          7         reflected on Bolder Exhibit 15 of 22,526,610,

          8         what percentage of the overall partners'

          9         capital as of December 31, 2015 does that

         10         represent?

         11     A   So the total partners' capital, not just the

         12         limited partners that's listed in page 5 of the

         13         audited statements?

         14     Q   The limited partners' capital.

         15     A   Just the limited partners' capital, okay.

         16         18.4 percent.

         17     Q   Just for the sake of completeness here, can we

         18         do the total partners capital?

         19     A   The 134 million?

         20     Q   Yeah.

         21     A   So that's approximately 16.7 percent.

         22     Q   Do you know why the two percentages that you

         23         just calculated are different than the reported

         24         ownership percentage on the Statements of

         25         Capital Account we've been looking at?



                                                                  123


          1     A   No.

          2     Q   How should Dr. Wazzan have calculated the value

          3         as of December 2016 differently than he did?

          4     A   So instead of projecting the balance of the

          5         December 31, 2016 statement, I think his

          6         starting point should have been the audited

          7         financial statements as a starting point.

          8     Q   What would he have done with that document?

          9     A   He would have used the partners' capital in the

         10         audited financial statements as a starting

         11         point.  If there were any additional

         12         allocations that needed to be included, he

         13         would have added those in and then he would

         14         have just multiplied the ownership percentage

         15         by that balance in the absence of a capital

         16         account statement as of December 31, 2016.

         17     Q   Which you didn't have?

         18     A   Right.

         19     Q   What percentage should he have used?

         20     A   I'm sorry?

         21     Q   Which percentage should he have used to

         22         ascertain Highland's interest?

         23     A   Well, the last available statement for 2016

         24         showed the 14.76 percent as the ownership

         25         percentage.



                                                                  124


          1     Q   Does that percentage seem to be consistent with

          2         the limited partners' capital percentages that

          3         we just looked at based on the audited

          4         financial statement for 2016?

          5     A   There were some differences in how they're

          6         calculated, but I don't know what additional

          7         allocations would have been needed to adjust

          8         the audited financial statements.

          9     Q   You didn't consider this issue of ownership

         10         percentage in your analysis of the Wazzan

         11         report, is that right?

         12     A   I'm sorry.  What issue are you referring to?

         13     Q   What Highland's ownership interest actually is,

         14         did you investigate that issue?

         15     A   Did I investigate what their ownership interest

         16         actually is?

         17     Q   Yes.

         18     A   No.  I just reviewed what was on the statement.

         19     Q   In your view, if it says 14.76 on the

         20         Statement of Capital Account, it should be

         21         14.76?

         22     A   Unless I have reason to believe that it's

         23         inaccurate, which I didn't.

         24     Q   Do you now?

         25     A   No.  I don't believe that it's inaccurate.  I



                                                                  125


          1         don't have enough information because I don't

          2         know if there's any additional allocations that

          3         would have been needed to adjust the audited

          4         financial statements.

          5     Q   All right.  With respect to distributions as of

          6         December 2016, I understand your disagreement

          7         to be the same disagreement that you had with

          8         distributions as of July 2019, is that right?

          9     A   Yes.

         10     Q   See, we're cutting some time here as we go.

         11         This is good.

         12                       MR. UEBLER:  Let's go off the

         13         record.

         14                       (Recess taken.)

         15     Q   If you assume that a limited partner has an

         16         ending balance in a quarterly Statement of

         17         Capital Account of $100 in quarter 1 and during

         18         the next quarter that partner receives a

         19         distribution of $10, all else being equal, what

         20         would happen to that partners reported ending

         21         balance as of the next quarter?

         22     A   So I guess if I understand your question, if he

         23         had an amount that increased his capital

         24         account balance --

         25     Q   I'm saying if you start a quarter with $100 and



                                                                  126


          1         in the next quarter you receive a distribution

          2         of $10, all else being equal, what's the

          3         capital account balance in the next quarter?

          4     A   It would increase by $10.

          5     Q   So it would be --

          6     A   And we're saying all else equal, right?

          7     Q   Yeah.  So it would increase by $10?

          8     A   All else being equal, unless there's something

          9         I'm missing with your question.

         10     Q   No.

         11               So let's take Bolder 12, for example.

         12         That's the March 31, 2013 Highland Capital

         13         Statement of Capital Account.  Do you see where

         14         it says, "Beginning balance as of January 1,

         15         2013"?

         16     A   Yes.

         17     Q   It's got 11.8 million?

         18     A   Uh-huh.

         19     Q   And underneath you have Capital Activity.  It

         20         lists 1.67 million in distributions.

         21               Do you see that?

         22     A   Yes.

         23     Q   Was the ending balance for that quarter

         24         increased or decreased by the amount of that

         25         distribution?



                                                                  127


          1     A   It was decreased.

          2     Q   So after Highland Capital received a

          3         distribution in that report, its capital

          4         account balance was decreased by the amount of

          5         that distribution?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   In your answer to my hypothetical why were you

          8         saying the amount would increase?

          9     A   I guess in your hypothetical I was thinking of

         10         income that was allocated to them like in a

         11         typical partnership, and that would increase

         12         their capital balance.  So distribution could

         13         sometimes mean money flowing out, so I guess I

         14         was just confused on what you meant.

         15     Q   Sure.  And I had meant to say cash distribution

         16         flowing out.

         17     A   Okay.

         18     Q   Which I believe was --

         19     A   Would have changed my answer.

         20     Q   Right.  Which would be consistent with what we

         21         saw in Bolder 12?

         22     A   Yes.

         23     Q   On page 10 of your report there's a section

         24         called Value of Highland Restoration Capital

         25         Partners, L.P. to Mr. Daugherty.  And this



                                                                  128


          1         section consists of effectively two

          2         disagreements with the Wazzan report, is that

          3         right?

          4     A   Yes.

          5     Q   The DLOC, D L O C, and the DLOM, D L O M?

          6     A   Yes.

          7     Q   Let's start with DLOC, or Discount for Lack Of

          8         Control.  Explain to me what a DLOC is?

          9     A   A DLOC is an adjustment from value to account

         10         for the lack of control in an ownership

         11         interest.

         12     Q   Do you agree with Dr. Wazzan's application of

         13         a DLOC for purposes of calculating value to

         14         Mr. Daugherty, just the application of one?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   Do you have an opinion regarding what DLOC

         17         should have been applied?

         18     A   No.

         19     Q   Did you undertake any analysis to determine an

         20         appropriate DLOC?

         21     A   No.

         22     Q   In your expert valuation engagements have you

         23         in the past calculated or determined an

         24         appropriate DLOC?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  129


          1     Q   What is your process for determining that

          2         appropriate DLOC?

          3     A   So it depends on the interest that's being

          4         valued, but we typically use a starting rate

          5         based either on Mergerstat or based on other

          6         studies and then we make adjustments to that

          7         based on specific rights and restrictions of

          8         the ownership interests that we're valuing.

          9     Q   Apart from Mergerstat, what other studies are

         10         you referring to?

         11     A   There's control premium studies that are

         12         offered through Business Valuation Resources.

         13     Q   In footnote 71 of his report Dr. Wazzan cited

         14         Business Valuation Resources Update on Control

         15         Premiums, What the Experts Say.

         16               Do you see that?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Is that a source that you have used to

         19         determine DLOC?

         20     A   No.

         21     Q   Are you familiar with the source Business

         22         Valuation Resources?

         23     A   Yes.  I'm familiar with the company.

         24     Q   Is that company's data accepted in your

         25         profession as a reliable resource?



                                                                  130


          1     A   Business Valuation Resources doesn't provide

          2         the data.

          3     Q   Is data reported by Business Valuation

          4         Resources considered reliable in your

          5         profession?  Or should I say compiled?  Would

          6         that be a better question?  Let me start over.

          7               Is data compiled by Business Valuation

          8         Resources considered reliable in your

          9         profession?

         10     A   The studies that they offer that you can

         11         subscribe to are generally considered reliable,

         12         yes.

         13     Q   Have you reviewed the resource cited by

         14         Dr. Wazzan in footnote 71?

         15     A   No.

         16     Q   Why not?

         17     A   Because I typically look at the Mergerstat

         18         studies themselves and it looks like this is an

         19         article.

         20     Q   In your experience of determining appropriate

         21         DLOC, have you ever relied on sources other

         22         than Mergerstat?

         23     A   I may have.  The entities offering the data,

         24         they change over the years.  It's been

         25         primarily Mergerstat, but there may have been



                                                                  131


          1         others that I've used over time.

          2     Q   And you've never relied on a study published by

          3         Business Valuation Resources, is that your

          4         testimony, for purposes of DLOC?

          5                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Object to form.

          6     A   Well, yes.  Because Business Valuation

          7         Resources doesn't provide the data.

          8     Q   Is it not published by Business Valuation

          9         Resources?

         10     A   So typically we rely on the actual studies when

         11         coming up with our DLOC.  I'm not familiar with

         12         this source that's cited here.

         13     Q   And you didn't review the source that's cited?

         14     A   No.

         15     Q   And you're not offering any opinion regarding

         16         the reliability of that source?

         17     A   No.

         18     Q   On page 10 of your report you listed three

         19         bullet points of factors that were taken from

         20         Dr. Wazzan's report.

         21               Do you see that?

         22     A   Yes.

         23     Q   Are you offering any opinion on how those three

         24         factors should be weighted for purposes of

         25         DLOC?



                                                                  132


          1     A   No.

          2     Q   Do you have a view regarding how any of those

          3         factors might affect an appropriate DLOC?

          4     A   No.

          5     Q   If you assume that based on the resource

          6         materials Dr. Wazzan relied on, he selected the

          7         highest reported discount, does the weighting

          8         of these three factors on page 10 of your

          9         report matter for purposes of the DLOC?

         10     A   If he selected the highest reported discount?

         11         Well, I would think that any factors that are

         12         specific to the entity that you're valuing

         13         would still need to be considered, because he

         14         would need a business for selecting the highest

         15         possible discount.

         16     Q   If you were to select the DLOC from a range of

         17         reported samples in the resource and he picked

         18         the largest discount, why would any of these

         19         specific factors need to be considered in that

         20         case?

         21     A   So in selecting the highest possible discount,

         22         he would still need to provide a rationale for

         23         doing that because there still needs to be a

         24         reasonable basis for the number that he

         25         selected.  So whether its these three specific



                                                                  133


          1         factors or if there's any additional factors

          2         that should have been considered, he would

          3         still need to provide support for the discount

          4         that was selected, whether it increased or

          5         decreased his percentage.

          6     Q   Would you agree that having the general partner

          7         constrained by the RCP Limited Partnership

          8         Agreement is a factor that should lower the

          9         discount?

         10     A   I believe so, yes.

         11     Q   Would you agree with the fact that as CALPERS

         12         is the largest limited partner of RCP -- that's

         13         C A L P E R S -- would favor a lower discount?

         14     A   That I can't say.  I haven't really looked into

         15         the impact that they would have, so I don't

         16         know.

         17     Q   Are you familiar with CALPERS?

         18     A   Not really, no.

         19                       MR. MASSIATTE:  You said a lower

         20         discount.  Did you mean higher discount?

         21                       MR. UEBLER:  I meant less of a

         22         discount.  It's always tough to know which

         23         direction you're going with this discussion.

         24     Q   Are you offering any other criticism or

         25         disagreement of Dr. Wazzan's DLOC apart from



                                                                  134


          1         the topics we've just discussed?

          2     A   No.

          3     Q   Did Mr. Wazzan's explanation of his DLOC during

          4         his deposition address any of your concerns

          5         about his DLOC analysis?

          6     A   It did to some extent, but he didn't really

          7         provide a lot of additional support in his

          8         deposition.

          9     Q   What was the extent to which your concerns were

         10         addressed?

         11     A   Well, because he just mentioned -- and I don't

         12         recall his exact words, but he just mentioned

         13         which ones he thought would increase -- which

         14         ones he thought would increase his adjustment.

         15         So he mentioned like in general, you know,

         16         which ones he thought would increase or

         17         decrease, but there wasn't an in-depth

         18         explanation of why he thought that way that I

         19         can recall.

         20     Q   Let's take each of the three briefly that are

         21         listed on page 10.  "RCP's general partner,

         22         Highland Restoration Capital Partners GP, LLC,

         23         is a wholly owned subsidiary of Highland

         24         Capital Management."

         25               Is it your recollection that he testified



                                                                  135


          1         that that would increase the discount?

          2     A   I don't recall what his testimony was with

          3         regard to that factor.

          4     Q   If he testified that it would increase the

          5         discount, would you agree with that?

          6     A   I don't know that I could say that I agree

          7         without doing my own analysis.

          8     Q   With respect to the second bullet, I think

          9         you've already said that the RCP Limited

         10         Partnership Agreement would be a factor --

         11     A   Yes.

         12     Q   -- to lower, decrease the discount?

         13     A   To decrease the discount?  You mean increase,

         14         right?

         15               Well, it would depend.  So I don't know

         16         that I can -- it would depend, I guess, because

         17         there may be some factors in the agreement that

         18         would increase the discount and some that would

         19         lower.  So I don't know that I could give an

         20         opinion, I guess.

         21     Q   It's not something you've looked into?

         22     A   No.

         23     Q   What factors would you look into when

         24         considering whether the Limited Partnership

         25         Agreement should increase or decrease the



                                                                  136


          1         discount?

          2     A   Look at any restrictions on transfer,

          3         management rights, what the voting stipulations

          4         are in the agreement.  And there's probably

          5         other factors that may be specific to different

          6         entities, but those are some of the main ones.

          7         It's basically what restrictions that the

          8         minority owners would have.

          9     Q   You're not offering any expert opinions on

         10         those issues?

         11     A   No.

         12     Q   All right.  Let's talk about the DLOM.

         13               Are you familiar with the Stout

         14         Restricted Stock Study Database?

         15     A   Yes.

         16     Q   What is the Stout Restricted Stock Study

         17         Database?

         18     A   It's a database that provides restricted stock.

         19     Q   Have you used the Stout Database for any

         20         valuations?

         21     A   Yes.  But I think the last time I did use it it

         22         was FMV opinions.

         23     Q   Did you say FMV opinions?

         24     A   Yes.

         25     Q   But you think it was the Stout Database?



                                                                  137


          1     A   I think so.

          2     Q   When was that?

          3     A   I don't recall offhand.  It hasn't been that

          4         long ago though.  Probably within the last

          5         five years.

          6     Q   Is the Stout Database considered a reliable

          7         resource in your profession?

          8     A   Generally, yes.

          9     Q   You wrote in your report that the use of a

         10         simple average without a rigorous analysis is

         11         generally considered not appropriate when

         12         determining a DLOM.

         13               Would you describe for me what a rigorous

         14         analysis is?

         15     A   The analysis that would include support

         16         specific to the ownership interest that's being

         17         valued.

         18     Q   What support?

         19     A   So issues related to marketability, its holding

         20         period, financial performance of the entity.  I

         21         know there's other factors.  I just can't think

         22         of them at this time.  But a lot of it is

         23         holding period, financial performance,

         24         restrictions on transfers.

         25     Q   Did Dr. Wazzan consider the holding period in



                                                                  138


          1         determining his DLOM?

          2     A   Yes.  He did a screening of the database for

          3         restricted stock with a two-year holding

          4         period.

          5     Q   Do you disagree with that approach?

          6     A   No.  I don't disagree with his screening the

          7         database for the stock for a two-year holding

          8         period.

          9     Q   What is your disagreement then with his

         10         approach?

         11     A   That other factors that might impact

         12         marketability did not appear to be considered

         13         in his analysis and that he just used the

         14         median of the stocks from his screening.

         15     Q   And you've said that financial performance is

         16         one of those factors?

         17     A   Yes.

         18     Q   Can you tell me any other factors?

         19     A   Restrictions on transferability.  The ability

         20         of the entity to do a public offering.  Those

         21         are a couple of the factors that come to mind.

         22     Q   If we were starting with a clean plate in this

         23         case and you were engaged to determine the

         24         appropriate DLOM as of July 2019, how would you

         25         approach that project?



                                                                  139


          1     A   I would approach it by starting with a similar

          2         database.  And then the next step would be a

          3         review of the Limited Partnership Agreement.

          4         And then discussions with counsel regarding the

          5         correct interpretation of the agreement.  And

          6         then any specific factors related to the

          7         financial performance of the entity that would

          8         need to be considered.

          9     Q   In your experience have you always focused your

         10         DLOM research on a particular industry?

         11     A   Particular industry?

         12     Q   So, for example, if you're attempting to

         13         determine an appropriate DLOM for an ambulatory

         14         surgery center -- did I get that right?

         15     A   Uh-huh.

         16     Q   Are you limiting your data screening to that

         17         industry?

         18     A   No.

         19     Q   Okay.  So you don't disagree with the use of

         20         data from other industries apart from the

         21         industry of the entity that's being valued?

         22     A   No.  Because the issue is marketability, so

         23         we're looking at issues that impact

         24         marketability.

         25     Q   Not industry specific issues?



                                                                  140


          1     A   Right.

          2     Q   Understood.

          3               Regarding the DLOM for the December 2016

          4         valuation, you noted in your report that the

          5         calculation included a 30 percent figure and

          6         not the 31 percent figure that was reported?

          7     A   Yes.

          8     Q   And that error was corrected in Dr. Wazzan's

          9         updated report, is that right?

         10     A   I'm sorry.  What exhibit was that?

         11     Q   Exhibit 7.

         12     A   Yes.  He did correct that in his amended

         13         report.

         14     Q   Apart from that calculation error which you

         15         pointed out and then was corrected, are you

         16         offering any opinions on the DLOM applied to

         17         the December 8 valuation?

         18     A   No.

         19                        -  -  -  -  -

         20            (Plaintiff's Exhibit 17 was marked.)

         21                       -  -  -  -  -

         22     Q   You've been handed Bolder Exhibit 17, which I

         23         believe is the document cited in footnote 11 on

         24         page 11 of your report?

         25     A   Yes.



                                                                  141


          1     Q   This was an exhibit we used on Friday in

          2         Dr. Wazzan's deposition?

          3     A   Yes.

          4     Q   For what purpose are you relying on this

          5         resource in your report?

          6     A   I was just stating that's one of the issues

          7         with determining a DLOM, if that's something

          8         that has been done, just the use of a simple

          9         average which is what was used in Dr. Wazzan's

         10         report.

         11     Q   What in this report, Bolder 17, would help the

         12         Court determine an appropriate DLOM in this

         13         case?

         14     A   What would help the Court determine an

         15         appropriate DLOM?

         16     Q   Yeah.  How should the Court use Bolder 17 to

         17         determine what the DLOM should be?

         18     A   Is this the full document?

         19     Q   This is the document that was marked as an

         20         exhibit in the Wazzan deposition.

         21     A   Because it goes from page 3 to page 75.

         22     Q   Right.

         23     A   So it would be helpful if I had the full

         24         document to answer that question, because all

         25         of the pages that discuss the different



                                                                  142


          1         approaches aren't included in here.

          2     Q   You're not offering an opinion on what the DLOM

          3         should be, right?

          4     A   Correct.

          5     Q   Are you aware of any authority showing that

          6         the Delaware Court of Chancery follows this

          7         IRS Job Aid in determining an appropriate DLOM?

          8     A   I'm sorry.  Could you repeat the question?

          9     Q   Sure.

         10               Are you aware of any authority that

         11         shows that the Court of Chancery follows this

         12         IRS Job Aid in determining DLOM?

         13     A   I am not aware of any.

         14     Q   Is it the IRS' position that this may not be

         15         used or cited as authority for setting any

         16         legal position?

         17     A   That's what's stated on the front of the

         18         document.

         19     Q   Is it also the IRS' position that this guide is

         20         not all encompassing and should not be cited or

         21         relied upon as legal or any other precedent?

         22         That would be under the disclaimer on page 2.

         23     A   Yes.  That's correct.

         24     Q   How have you used Bolder 17 in the past in

         25         determining an appropriate DLOM for a



                                                                  143


          1         valuation?

          2     A   Well, I looked at the approaches cited in the

          3         document and then also I try to make sure that

          4         any issues with using the data that they've

          5         acknowledged in the report I have addressed and

          6         I'm not making those same issues in my

          7         analysis.

          8     Q   So tell me what Dr. Wazzan did here that, in

          9         your view, is inconsistent with this Job Aid

         10         for IRS Valuation Professionals?

         11     A   The use of a simple average.

         12     Q   From the studies does the IRS Job Aid tell us

         13         what he should have done instead?

         14     A   So this isn't the full document, so I think

         15         there's some additional discussion in there,

         16         but in this section it just lists that as one

         17         of the issues.

         18                       MR. UEBLER:  Let's go off the

         19         record.

         20                      (Recess taken.)

         21     Q   Dr. Bolder, are you aware of any disagreements

         22         that you have that are reflected in your report

         23         that we haven't addressed today?

         24     A   I don't think so.

         25     Q   Are there any areas of disagreement that are



                                                                  144


          1         not listed in your report that you plan to

          2         testify about at any trial in this action?

          3     A   I don't think so.

          4                       MR. UEBLER:  In that case, I

          5         thank you for your time today.  I don't have

          6         any more questions.

          7                       THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

          8                       MR. MASSIATTE:  Defendants

          9         reserve the right to examine Dr. Bolder at the

         10         time of trial.  The witness will read and sign.

         11                (Off the record at 2:36 p.m.)

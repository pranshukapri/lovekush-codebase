          11          Q.    We have an interpreter here

          12   today, correct?

          13          A.    Correct.

          14          Q.    I understand that you speak

          17   BY MR. LINN:

          18          Q.    For purposes of today, it's

          19   my understanding that you feel more

          21   correct?

          22          A.    That's correct.

          23          Q.    So for purposes of today, I

           2   question before you begin to answer.

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    I never want us to be in a

           5   situation where you later told us that

           6   you didn't understand our questions.

           7          A.    That's fine.

           8          Q.    So I'm going to take your

           9   deposition today.  Have you ever had your

          10   deposition taken before?

          11          A.    No.

          12          Q.    All right.  Basically what

          13   this is is a question-and-answer session.

          14   I'm going to ask you some questions

          15   concerning your background.

          16          A.    Mhmm.

          17          Q.    The accident, and some other

          18   matters.  If at any time I ask you a

          19   question that you don't know the answer

          20   to, please let me know that you do not

          21   understand my question and I will repeat

          22   it or rephrase it.

          23          A.    Okay.

          24          Q.    If you don't know the answer

           4          Q.    I may ask you for estimates

           6   provide us with an estimate, please do

           7   so.  But if you simply have no idea, just

           8   let me know and I'll move on.

           9          A.    Yes.

          10          Q.    It's important today that

          11   you answer all questions verbally.  A

          12   shrug or a gesture does not show up on

          13   our transcript.  And sir, if I ask you a

          14   question today and you did not tell me

          15   that you were confused or you did not

          16   understand the question, I'm going to

          17   assume that you understood the question

          18   that I asked you and that you answered

          19   that question honestly.

          20          A.    That's fine.

          21          Q.    All right.  Sir, are you

          22   under the influence of any drugs,

          23   medication, or alcohol that would prevent

          24   your ability to understand and answer

           1          Q.    Okay.  If the police report,

           2   sir, in this matter indicates that the

           3   incident took place at the intersection

           4   of 12th and Potter streets, would you

           5   have reason to disagree with that?

           6          A.    No, that's probably right.

           7          Q.    All right.  The police

           8   report indicates that prior to the

           9   accident, you had been traveling

          10   eastbound on 12th Street; does that sound

          11   right to you?

          13                MS. KRENICKY:  Just before

          14          you continue, I just want a

          16          the police report to any extent

          17          that it could be used into trial.

          18          But I understand what you're doing

          19          at this point.  So just so I don't

          20          keep interrupting you, I'd just

          21          like a standing objection to the

          22          admissibility of the police report

          23          in this case.

          19          Q.    Okay.  Sir, from the time

          20   that you got onto 12th Street

          21   approximately two blocks before Potter

          22   Street, can you take me from that point

          23   in time and tell me what happened?

          24          A.    I still had like about ten

           1   meters to arrive to the stop sign, and

           2   when I looked at her car, she was already

           3   very close to the corner, to my corner.

           4          Q.    Tell me what happened at

           5   that point.

           6          A.    I couldn't brake -- I did

           7   brake, but...

           8          Q.    What happened after you

           9   applied your brakes?

          10          A.    I stood there because we

          11   were already together.

          12          Q.    Okay.  Let's bring us back

          13   in time.  Do you know what street you

          14   were on just before you got onto 12th

          15   Street?

          16          A.    I think it was 322, I

          17   believe.

          18          Q.    All right.  Is the

          19   intersection of 322 and 12th Street

          20   approximately two blocks away from

          21   Potter?

          22          A.    Yes.

          23          Q.    Okay.  So you turn off of

          24   322 and you get onto 12th Street,

           1   correct?

           2          A.    Yes.

           3          Q.    And then you traveled one

           4   block?

           5          A.    Yes.

           6          Q.    What is the intersection

           7   after that one block?

           8          A.    I don't know.

           9          Q.    Okay.  Is that intersection

          10   a block before Potter Street controlled

          11   by a traffic light or a stop sign?

          12          A.    A stop sign.

          13          Q.    Did you stop at that

          14   intersection one block before 12th and

          15   Potter Street?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    And then the next

          18   intersecting street after that stop sign

          19   would be 12th and Potter?

          20          A.    Yes.

          21          Q.    Do you know what the speed

          22   limit would be on 12th Street as you're

          23   approaching Potter?

          24          A.    25.

           1          Q.    Okay.  If the police report

           2   in this matter indicated that the speed

           3   limit for 12th Street would have been 15

           4   miles an hour, would you have a reason to

           5   agree or disagree with that?

           6          A.    No, must be correct.

           7          Q.    I'm sorry.

           8          A.    It must be correct.

           9          Q.    So if you were doing 25

          10   miles an hour and the speed limit was 15

          11   miles an hour, can we agree that you were

          12   traveling faster than the speed limit

          13   permitted as you were traveling on Potter

          14   Street?

          17   BY MR. LINN:

          18          Q.    You can answer.

          19          A.    I said 25 because I'm not

          20   sure.  I know that the speed limit is

          21   very slow.

          22          Q.    Okay, fine.  As you were

          23   approaching Potter Street while

           2          A.    No.

           3          Q.    Were you making any calls?

           4          A.    I made calls after the

           5   accident.

           6          Q.    Were you making calls just

           7   before the accident?

           8          A.    No.

           9          Q.    Does your Kia that you had

          10   on the date of the accident, does that

          11   have hands-free use of your cellphone?

          12          A.    Yes.  All my vehicles have

          13   that.

          14          Q.    Do you have to hold your

          15   phone in order to make a phone call?

          16          A.    No.

          17          Q.    Were you texting at the time

          18   of this accident?

          19          A.    No.

          20          Q.    Does your Kia Rio have the

          21   capability of hands-free texting while

          22   you're operating your vehicle?

          23          A.    No.

           1   physically have to text on your phone in

           2   order to text if you were in your

           3   vehicle?

           4          A.    Yes.  But I wasn't doing

           5   that.

           6          Q.    Understood.  As you approach

           7   Potter Street, is there any obstruction

           8   to your view for cars that are traveling

           9   on Potter Street which approach 12th

          10   Street?

          11          A.    No.

          12          Q.    And by that I mean

          13   construction?

          14          A.    No.

          15          Q.    Shrubbery or trees?

          16          A.    No.

          17          Q.    Okay.  So as you're coming

          18   down 12th Street, at any point in time,

          19   do you stop at the stop sign before the

          20   impact?

          21          A.    No, because I hadn't gotten

          22   to the stop yet.

          23          Q.    Okay.  At the moment of

          24   impact, approximately how fast were you

           1   traveling?

           2          A.    I was almost stopped.  Like

           3   5 or 10, something like that.

           4          Q.    Okay.  When you first see

           5   the other vehicle for the very first

           6   time, where is that vehicle?

           7          A.    She was coming out of her

           8   stop from the street.

           9          Q.    Was she coming out from

          10   Potter Street?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    When you first see her for

          13   the first time you say she's coming out,

          14   has she entered the intersection yet?

          15          A.    She had already come out.

          16          Q.    How much of her vehicle had

          17   entered the intersection at the time that

          18   you first see her?

          19          A.    She had already come into

          20   the street.

          21          Q.    Was half of her car into the

          22   intersection, her entire car into the

          23   intersection, a small portion, can you

          24   give us an estimate as to how much of her

           1   car was into the intersection when you

           2   first lay eyes on it?

           3          A.    Half of the vehicle.

           4          Q.    Okay.  So half of the

           5   vehicle was still on Potter Street and

           6   half of her vehicle was into the

           7   intersection; is that correct?

           9          first saw it.

          10   BY MR. LINN:

          11          Q.    When you first saw it.

          12          A.    Yeah.  The first time that I

          13   saw it, it was half inside.

          14          Q.    Okay.  Where is the front of

          15   your vehicle when you see her vehicle for

          16   the very first time?

          17          A.    I was arriving to the stop.

          18          Q.    Okay.  Can you give us an

          19   estimate as to how far you were from the

          20   stop sign when you first saw her vehicle

          21   for the first time?

          22          A.    Like five meters.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And at that point,

          24   your vehicle was traveling five miles an

           1   hour?

           2          A.    Yeah, because I was getting

           3   ready for the stop.

           4          Q.    Okay.  At the moment of

           5   impact, can you tell us where your

           6   vehicle was?

           7          A.    Behind the stop.

           8          Q.    Okay.  Were you still five

           9   meters from the stop sign at the moment

          10   of impact?

          11          A.    No.  What happens is that

          12   she came out very fast and she went into

          13   my lane.

          14          Q.    Okay, and I understand that.

          15   I guess what I want to know is at the

          16   moment of impact, how far from the stop

          17   sign were you?

          18          A.    Like three meters.

          19          Q.    And you said that when she

          20   made her turn, she was in your lane of

          21   travel, correct?

           1          Q.    At the moment of impact, she

           2   was in your lane of travel?

           3          A.    Not all of it, but half of

           4   it, a part of it, yes.

           5          Q.    And we can agree that you

           6   were in the eastbound lanes of 12th

           7   Street, correct?

           8          A.    Yes.

           9          Q.    How much of her vehicle was

          11   impact?

          12          A.    The street is small, like a

          13   meter.

          14          Q.    Okay.  Was any portion of

          15   her vehicle in the westbound lane of 12th

          16   Street at the moment of impact?

          17          A.    Yes.

          18          Q.    How much of her vehicle was

          19   in the westbound lane versus how much of

          20   her vehicle was in the eastbound lane?

          21          A.    She only went like a meter

          22   inside of my lane.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And the impact took

          24   place approximately three meters before

           2          A.    Yes.

           3          Q.    From the time that you first

           4   see her when you were five meters from

           5   the stop sign until the moment of impact,

           6   can you give us an estimate as to how

           7   much time passed?

           8          A.    How much time went by?

           9          Q.    From the moment that you

          10   first see her until the moment of impact,

          11   how much time passed?

          12          A.    Seconds.

          13          Q.    Did you do anything to try

          14   and attempt to avoid the accident?

          15          A.    Yes, I applied the brakes.

          16          Q.    Did you blow your horn?

          17          A.    I didn't have time for that.

          18          Q.    Did the other driver blow

          19   her horn?

          21   crashed she did.

           5          Q.    Do you have any explanation

           6   as to why she would have blown her horn

          12          A.    I can only say that she came

          13   out of the stop very fast, that's the

          14   only thing that I think.

          15          Q.    Do you ever see any part of

          16   her vehicle traveling up Potter Street?

          17          A.    Yes.

          18          Q.    Where was she on Potter

          19   Street when you saw her traveling up

          20   Potter Street?

          21          A.    Well, I just saw her when

          22   she came out of the stop.

          23          Q.    Okay.  Did you ever see her

           1   intersection of Potter Street?

           2          A.    No.

           3          Q.    Was there anything that

           4   would have obstructed your view from

           5   seeing her traveling down Potter Street

           6   before it got to the intersection?

           7          A.    No.

           8          Q.    When you were five meters

           9   from the stop sign, approximately how far

          10   down Potter Street can you see the

          11   vehicle?

          12          A.    Inside of the street, very

          13   little.

          14          Q.    Why is it that you can only

          15   see very little?

          16          A.    Because there are cars

          17   parked on that street.

          18          Q.    Okay.  Were cars parked on

          19   Potter Street as it approached its

          20   intersection on that particular day?

          21          A.    Yes.

          22          Q.    And those parked vehicles

          23   was what would have obstructed your view

          24   of seeing her car come up Potter Street

           1   as it approached 12th?

           2          A.    Not me, but I guess the

           3   other vehicle would have had problems

           4   because they're parked on the other side.

           5          Q.    So when you say, "Not me,"

           6   was your view of vehicles coming up

           7   Potter Street obstructed?

           8          A.    No.

           9          Q.    So you had a clear view of

          10   cars coming up Potter Street?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    Could you see half a block

          13   down Potter Street where it meets its

          14   intersection with 12th Street?

          15          A.    Yeah.  You can see when the

          16   cars are coming up to do the stop.

          17          Q.    From five meters from the

          18   stop sign, could you see half a block

          19   down Potter Street as it approaches its

          20   intersection with 12th Street?

          21          A.    Half the block, no.

          22          Q.    How much of the block can

          23   you see when you're five meters from the

          24   stop sign?

           1          A.    Like ten meters.

           2          Q.    Okay.  As you were five

           3   meters from the stop sign, did you look

           4   down Potter Street?

           5          A.    Yes.

           6          Q.    And at that point, you could

           7   see ten meters down Potter Street?

           8          A.    More or less.

           9          Q.    What part of your vehicle

          10   was struck?

          11          A.    The driver side.

          12          Q.    Would that be the front of

          13   your car?

          14          A.    No, it wasn't in front, it

          15   was in the corner of the bumper.

          16          Q.    Is that where the front of

          17   your car meets the side of your car?

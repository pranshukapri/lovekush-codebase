      16   BY MR. BLUM:

      17        Q    Good morning.  Could you state your

      18   full name for the record.

      19        A    Randy Clemens.

      20        Q    Good morning, Randy.  Do you mind if

      21   I call you Randy throughout the deposition?

      22        A    That's fine.

      23        Q    My name is Joseph Blum and I

      24   represent Mercedes-Benz in the lawsuit that


                                                         8




       1   has been brought by Clemens Cleaning Village

       2   and P.R. Clemens Family Partnership.

       3             I'm going to ask you a series of

       4   questions today.  If at any time you don't

       5   understand my question, please tell me right

       6   away.  If you don't hear the question, please

       7   tell us, we'll be happy to restate it or read

       8   it back.

       9        A    Okay.

      10        Q    We would ask that you keep all your

      11   responses verbal, because the court reporter

      12   cannot take down nods of our heads or shrugs

      13   of our shoulders.

      14             Another thing which we all seem to

      15   struggle with is trying to just let each other

      16   finish speaking before you start answering or

      17   I start asking a new question, because the

      18   court reporter has to take everything down,

      19   and she can't take both of us down at one

      20   time.

      21             Do you understand that?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    Is there anything that would prevent

      24   you from accurately testifying today?


                                                         9




       1        A    No.

       2        Q    Okay.  Could you tell us your

       3   educational background, please?

       4        A    Graduated from Christopher Dock High

       5   School.

       6        Q    All right.  And after you graduated

       7   from high school, can you just tell us

       8   basically what your employment history has

       9   been?

      10        A    Worked for Clemens Dry Cleaners for

      11   several years, and then when the uniform

      12   rental was started, I moved into that.

      13        Q    Okay.  And approximately when was it

      14   that you started at Clemens Dry Cleaners?

      15        A    During high school.

      16        Q    Okay.  And what year did you

      17   graduate from high school?

      18        A    '85.

      19        Q    All right.  And how many years did

      20   you work for the dry cleaner?

      21        A    1988, so five years.

      22        Q    Okay.  And in '88 you left the dry

      23   cleaner and came to the uniform business?

      24        A    When we opened this facility, yes.


                                                        10




       1        Q    Okay.  And I take it that the dry

       2   cleaning was a family run business?

       3        A    Correct.

       4        Q    And was it run by your parents?

       5        A    Correct.

       6        Q    And does the dry cleaning business

       7   still operate today?

       8        A    No.

       9        Q    Okay.  When did that stop?

      10        A    Approximately 2007.

      11        Q    Okay.

      12        A    Approximately.

      13        Q    And when you came here in 1988 to

      14   the -- I'll call it the uniform facility, does

      15   that make sense?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    Was that the first time that the

      18   family had gotten into the business of like a

      19   uniform business?

      20        A    No.

      21        Q    Okay.  How long had the uniform

      22   business been operating before that?

      23        A    Two years, 1986.

      24        Q    And where was it located before it


                                                        11




       1   came here to the facility we're sitting at

       2   today?

       3        A    In the dry cleaning location.

       4        Q    Okay.  And just so we're all clear,

       5   is it okay with you if I just call this

       6   building we're sitting at the 5th Street

       7   facility?

       8        A    (Witness shakes head.)

       9        Q    So for the purposes of your

      10   deposition today, did you do anything to

      11   prepare?

      12        A    No.

      13        Q    All right.  Did you review any of

      14   the claims information that has been

      15   submitted?

      16        A    I don't understand.

      17        Q    Okay.  So you understand that

      18   Clemens Cleaning Village and P.R. Family

      19   Partnership are both making claims in this

      20   case?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Okay.  And did you review any of the

      23   what I'll call documents or information that

      24   backs up those claims in terms of the amount


                                                        12




       1   of damages?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  Tell me what you reviewed?

       4        A    So I originally gave the invoices of

       5   the -- what do you say, the estimates that we

       6   had given for each thing, the bills, I was

       7   involved in compiling all that information

       8   that we gave six months ago.

       9        Q    Okay.  I'm going to stop you for one

      10   second.  I understand that you certainly have

      11   worked with John to support the claim.  But I

      12   was talking specifically in order to get ready

      13   for today, like yesterday did you sit down and

      14   review all those materials or anything like

      15   that?

      16        A    No.  I did that last week.

      17        Q    Okay.

      18        A    But I didn't -- I mean, there was

      19   nothing, I didn't go study any kind of

      20   questions or anything like.

      21        Q    No.  But in terms of the

      22   documentation like for the claims that are

      23   being submitted by both companies, you have

      24   taken the time to review that and familiarize


                                                        13




       1   yourself?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Okay, great.  Have you read any of

       4   the deposition transcripts that have been

       5   taken in this or any other related cases?

       6        A    The deposition that I read was when

       7   they had the drivers from two months ago or

       8   something like that.

       9        Q    Okay.

      10        A    I didn't read the fire people, but

      11   the drivers, our drivers, I read that.

      12        Q    All right.  And when you read those

      13   transcripts, did you notice anything that they

      14   had said that was in error or that you think

      15   should be corrected?

      16        A    No.  No, I don't recall anything

      17   that was said or anything -- didn't seem like

      18   there was a lot of information there.

      19        Q    Okay.  And other than speaking to

      20   John, your counsel, did you speak to anyone to

      21   prepare for your deposition today?

      22        A    So John had said in the part that we

      23   got from -- I don't know if it was from you,

      24   they wanted to know who would be answering the


                                                        14




       1   questions.

       2        Q    Sure.  The notices, okay.

       3        A    Okay.  So Janet and I went over who

       4   we thought would be best to answer those

       5   questions.

       6        Q    Okay.  All right, great.  Anybody

       7   else that you spoke to?

       8        A    I spoke to my wife about hers

       9   yesterday.

      10        Q    Okay.  Anyone else?

      11        A    The gentleman that was here last

      12   week for Millers, I don't remember his name.

      13                  MR. SLATTERY:  We had a meeting

      14        with other counsel in this case

      15        representing other plaintiffs.

      16                  MR. BLUM:  Okay.

      17   BY MR. BLUM:

      18        Q    And what took place at that meeting?

      19        A    They wanted to know more of those

      20   questions that Janet and I discussed about who

      21   is going to be answering, I think it said --

      22   if I recall correctly --

      23        Q    You know, I'm going to ask you about

      24   those notices, so don't try to guess about


                                                        15




       1   that because we are going to pull them out in

       2   a minute.

       3             So basically at that meeting that

       4   occurred last week with everybody present, you

       5   discussed which categories each person would

       6   answer?

       7        A    Correct.

       8        Q    Okay.  And was there anything else

       9   discussed at that meeting?

      10        A    I don't recall.

      11        Q    Okay.  Have you ever had your

      12   deposition taken before?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    In what capacity?

      15        A    We were involved in a lawsuit,

      16   somebody fell at one of our customers'

      17   locations, and they had questions about the

      18   floor mats that were on the floor and things

      19   like that.

      20        Q    Sure.  Anything other than that one

      21   time?

      22        A    Yes.  I believe that -- I believe it

      23   was a deposition, it might have just been a

      24   question/answer thing.  We were rear-ended in


                                                        16




       1   a car accident -- by "we" I mean my wife and

       2   I -- and that was maybe four years ago.  And

       3   there was a meeting in Norristown, but I'm not

       4   sure if that was actually a deposition or if

       5   that was just --

       6        Q    Was that personal injury litigation

       7   about that accident?

       8        A    Yeah.  They were paying -- we had to

       9   present our medical bills and reimbursement

      10   for that.

      11        Q    Okay.  So there was the time where

      12   the company, you were there as a witness on

      13   the slip and fall, the personal injury case.

      14   Any other times that you have been deposed?

      15        A    Not that I can recall.

      16        Q    Okay.  I'm going to show you a

      17   series of documents which are the notices for

      18   these depositions that we're here about

      19   today.

       1   BY MR. SLATTERY:

       2        Q    And this first one I'm going to mark

       3   as Exhibit 1 to your deposition is just the

       4   actual notice for you personally.  I'm going

       5   to ask you if you have ever seen that before?

       6        A    I believe that's the one that was

       7   forwarded to me.

      13        of Clemens Cleaning Village, Inc., marked

      16   BY MR. BLUM:

      17        Q    I'm going to show you two documents

      18   now which we've marked as Exhibits 2 and 3,

      19   and these are what I'm going to call them the

      20   persons with the most knowledge deposition

      21   notices and ask you to take a look at each of

      22   those, and then I'm going to ask you a series

      23   of questions about them.

      24             Okay.  They're essentially the same


                                                        18




       1   except one is addressed to Clemens Cleaning

       2   Village and one is addressed to P.R. Family

       3   Partnership.  Okay?  So I'm going to ask you

       4   now, if you look at Page 3 of either of those

       5   two notices, there's a list of topics.  Do you

       6   see where I'm at?

       7        A    Uh-huh.

       8        Q    And after you and Janet discussed

       9   these topics, who did you decide was the best

      10   person to give testimony on the day-to-day

      11   business operations, including the processing

      12   of laundry intake and delivery?

      13        A    Myself.

      14        Q    Okay.  The second one, property

      15   damage claims as alleged in your December 21,

      16   2018, Second Amended Complaint?

      17        A    Okay.  So we weren't sure exactly

      18   what you were after here, so the property, is

      19   that like equipment and inventory and things

      20   like that?

      21        Q    Well, it really would have been all

      22   of the above.  Like, in other words, inventory

      23   and equipment here as well as the real estate.

      24        A    Okay.  So that was compiled by


                                                        19




       1   Janet, but the -- I don't know if it would be

       2   an adjuster or -- they were the ones who

       3   compiled, you know, went over and certified

       4   the list to make sure this was in the building

       5   and that was in the building and the value and

       6   things like that.

       7        Q    Okay.  I accept that, and there are

       8   some questions I'll ask you about that.

       9             But in terms of representatives of

      10   the company -- and you're making claims like

      11   above and beyond the insurance, okay -- so in

      12   terms of the inventory and equipment in the

      13   building, the claims above and beyond the

      14   insurance, would it be you or Janet would be

      15   the best person?

      16        A    We thought that it would be Janet

      17   because she could give you the information as

      18   far as how the inventory lists and things like

      19   that.

      20        Q    Okay.  And how about the building

      21   itself, the portions of the claim where you

      22   have allegations above and beyond the

      23   insurance, who would be best for that?

      24        A    That would be myself.


                                                        20




       1        Q    Okay, great.  There's also what we

       2   call a business interruption or extra expense

       3   claim?

       4        A    That was Janet.

       5        Q    Okay.  Purchasing and maintenance of

       6   the vehicles, your counsel has already told us

       7   that that would be Brett, we've already done.

       8             Construction and alterations made to

       9   the property here that we're sitting in, the

      10   5th Street property?

      11        A    Myself.

      12        Q    Okay, thank you.  You had told us

      13   that you came to work here at this facility in

      14   1988.  I'd like to just go through what your

      15   personal history is, like the positions you

      16   have held here at the company, if you could

      17   tell us that?

      18        A    When we first started, it was a

      19   part-time position.  I would do different jobs

      20   here because we were just getting started, and

      21   then the other times I'd be working at the dry

      22   cleaning for the first six months or a year.

      23        Q    Okay.

      24        A    And so you name it, I did it.


                                                        21




       1        Q    And does that include, did you go

       2   out making deliveries?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    Did you go out and do sales?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    Okay.  And at some point did your

       7   role change here at the 5th Street facility?

       8        A    As we added more people.

       9        Q    All right.  And so from 1988 going

      10   forward, have you had what I'll call an

      11   official title here at the company?

      12        A    General manager.

      13        Q    Okay.

      14        A    Vice-president.

      15        Q    And just on a day-to-day basis, can

      16   you tell us like the different types of issues

      17   that you're dealing with at the company?

      18        A    Could be production, could be sales,

      19   it could be delivery.

      20        Q    And has that been true from 1988 to

      21   the present?

      22        A    Yes.

      23        Q    And Janet, is that your sister?

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        22




       1        Q    And when did Janet first start

       2   working for the company?

       3        A    I am really not sure about that.

       4   She did our, originally did just bookkeeping,

       5   and then she went and worked at the dry

       6   cleaning place, and then she came and worked

       7   here when we closed the dry cleaning place

       8   down.  But as far as years, I do not remember.

       9        Q    Okay.  Is she listed as like the

      10   president of the company?

      11        A    Yup.

      12        Q    And when did she assume that title?

      13        A    I don't know.  You would have to ask

      14   her.  I really don't.

      15        Q    All right.  The company, Clemens

      16   Cleaning Village, Inc., are you personally a

      17   shareholder in that company?

      18        A    Yes.

      19        Q    And who are the owners of Clemens

      20   Cleaning Village?

      21        A    Janet and myself.

      22        Q    And did you take that over from your

      23   parents?

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        23




       1        Q    And when did you and your sister

       2   take over the ownership?

       3        A    The complete ownership I believe it

       4   was approximately 2014.  But I'm not 100% sure

       5   of that.

       6        Q    Okay.  P.R. Clemens Family Limited

       7   Partnership, does that own the property that

       8   we're sitting in?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    Okay.  And who are the members of

      11   that partnership?

      12        A    My father, Paul, and myself.

      13        Q    And when did you and your father

      14   become the members of that?

      15        A    So I believe that was 1998,

      16   approximately.

      17        Q    And I want to just talk about the

      18   history of the business, the cleaning

      19   business, if we could.

      20             Did it start out as uniforms, is

      21   that how the business started?

      22        A    At this location?

      23        Q    At this location, yes.

      24        A    Yes.


                                                        24




       1        Q    Okay.  And did it expand beyond

       2   uniforms into other things?

       3        A    As far as linens or --

       4        Q    Yes, linens, mats --

       5        A    The uniforms and the -- we did

       6   pretty well a little bit of those all,

       7   uniforms, mats, linens, at the other locations

       8   before we came here.

       9        Q    So those types of things were being

      10   done at the dry cleaning location?

      11        A    Yeah.

      12        Q    And then there was a decision to

      13   expand that portion of the business or

      14   separate it?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    Okay.  And after it separated and

      17   came here to the 5th Street facility, did the

      18   business change or grow over time?

      19        A    It grew.

      20        Q    Okay.  And did it grow just by

      21   increasing the volume of the things it was

      22   doing or did it add different lines of

      23   business or things that it was doing?

      24        A    It basically grew through the


                                                        25




       1   production of the same type of items.  We

       2   added embroidery and silk screen to our mix.

       3        Q    And approximately when did that

       4   happen?  I mean -- I'll just ask a different

       5   way --

       6        A    2000.

       7        Q    I was going to say it was before the

       8   fire in 2016?

       9        A    Yes, yes.

      10        Q    And anything else that got added to

      11   the business beyond the basic mats, uniforms,

      12   I assume you do linens for restaurants?

      13        A    Correct.

      14        Q    The embroidery business, was there

      15   anything else that I'm missing?

      16        A    The only thing -- and I'm sure

      17   there's other minor things that you could

      18   say -- but the first aid business.

      19        Q    Okay.  And tell me what is the first

      20   aid business?

      21        A    We service and sell first aid kits

      22   that you would mount on the walls at

      23   businesses.

      24        Q    And is that operated by Clemens


                                                        26




       1   Cleaning Village, Inc., or by another --

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    -- company?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    About when did that portion of the

       6   business start?

       7        A    This is an estimate only, but 2010.

       8        Q    Okay, again, before the fire

       9   occurred in 2016, okay.

      10             And was there any other business

      11   that your family was operating out of the

      12   facility before the fire in 2016?

      13        A    No.  Everything was under Clemens

      14   Cleaning.

      15        Q    Okay.  And the building that was

      16   destroyed in the fire in 2016, when your

      17   family first came here, did they lease or did

      18   they purchase a piece of the building?

      19        A    Leased 4,000 square feet.

      20        Q    And if we were standing on the 5th

      21   Street side of the building and looking at the

      22   front, could you tell us which units it was?

      23        A    To the right.

      24        Q    Okay.


                                                        27




       1        A    All the way to the right.

       2                  MR. BLUM:  Can we mark this as

       3        Exhibit 4, please.

       4                       - - -

       5                  (Floor Plan marked R. Clemens

       6        Exhibit 4.)

       7                       - - -

       8   BY MR. BLUM:

       9        Q    Randy, I'm going to show you a

      10   document which was marked as Exhibit 4 to your

      11   deposition.  This was produced by -- I'm not

      12   sure -- somebody in the litigation process and

      13   it is a floor plan, I believe, of the old

      14   building where the fire occurred.

      15             Do you agree with that?

      16        A    Uh-huh.

      17        Q    Have you ever seen this document

      18   before?

      19        A    Not this document, but one that's

      20   similar.

      21        Q    Okay.  And am I correct that at the

      22   bottom of that diagram where it says Floor

      23   Plan, that would be the 5th Street side of the

      24   building; is that correct?


                                                        28




       1        A    Correct.

       2        Q    So when your family first brought

       3   the business here, you were in the unit which

       4   is all the way to the right, and it's entitled

       5   Clemens Cleaning Village, Inc., I think it

       6   says Area --

       7        A    Correct.

       8        Q    -- #6, maybe?  Can't tell.

       9             And at some point did your family or

      10   did the business purchase that unit?

      11        A    The first purchase was the three

      12   right units.

      13        Q    The three right units together?

      14        A    Uh-huh.

      15        Q    There's one that's Dallas Avionics,

      16   then Clemens Cleaning, then Clemens Cleaning?

      17        A    Right.

      18        Q    When did that purchase occur,

      19   approximately?

      20        A    I believe that was in 1998.

      21        Q    Okay.  And after, when you purchased

      22   it or when the company purchased it, were

      23   those all three separate units, there was like

      24   no -- you couldn't pass from one unit to the


                                                        29




       1   other, would that have been accurate?

       2        A    When we purchased them?

       3        Q    Yes.

       4        A    No.  We already had all three, we

       5   were occupying all three.

       6        Q    So at some point you were leasing

       7   all three and then purchased them?

       8        A    Correct.

       9        Q    And at some point did the company

      10   put up what I'll call openings or doorways

      11   between those units?

      12        A    Correct.  They had like -- the

      13   building was built in six different sections,

      14   and in each section they had like office,

      15   office, office and then warehouse, warehouse,

      16   warehouse behind there.  And then in

      17   between -- I don't even know if it shows it on

      18   here -- there was parts that could be opened

      19   up.  So, for instance, Dallas Avionics has two

      20   sections here.  So they built the building

      21   that had the punchouts or something like that,

      22   so you could go between sections if you chose

      23   to.

      24        Q    Okay.  And after Clemens Cleaning


                                                        30




       1   Village started to operate the first three

       2   units, did you or did the company put

       3   punchouts through those properties?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    Okay.  And could --

       6        A    But that was before we bought it.

       7        Q    Right, okay.  Can you mark on this

       8   diagram, if I hand you a pen, where those

       9   original punchouts were on the walls between

      10   Units 1, 2, and 3?

      11        A    Yes.  I just can't remember between

      12   2 and 3 how that was.  I'm not sure how far

      13   between the 2 and the 3 it is or if I have

      14   that in the right geographic section.

      15        Q    Okay.  So the punchouts that were

      16   there, the original set of punchouts, were

      17   they, for lack of a better word, I'll call

      18   them man doors, or were they bigger than that?

      19        A    No.  They were bigger than that.

      20        Q    Can you tell us the approximate

      21   size?

      22        A    10 feet wide.

      23        Q    Okay.  And how about in terms of

      24   height, did they go all the way to the ceiling


                                                        31




       1   or did they only go part of the way up?

       2        A    These two here -- well, first of

       3   all, this is the office, so that's an office

       4   door.

       5        Q    Those are man doors, okay.

       6        A    So those would be man doors.

       7             So these would be like 10 by 10, 10

       8   by 10, and then this one, I don't know if

       9   that -- I don't know how wide that was, if

      10   that was this section.  I don't really recall.

      11        Q    Okay.  And just so we're clear,

      12   because the court reporter can't take down

      13   pointing, okay?

      14        A    Yep.

      15        Q    The original in between, this is

      16   Unit 1; right?

      17        A    1 and 2, I'm pretty sure of that,

      18   that that was two 10-foot sections.

      19        Q    Okay.  And one like man door at the

      20   office?

      21        A    Yup.

      22        Q    Okay.  And then between 2 and 3

      23   there's one man door down at the offices?

      24        A    Correct.


                                                        32




       1        Q    And then there's an opening that's

       2   bigger, but you don't recall the exact size?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    Okay, perfect.  And did that, did

       5   those openings remain the same all the way

       6   through to the time of the fire?

       7        A    Let's see.  See, I think that this

       8   wall here, I believe that was opened up, like

       9   removed onto this section here, I think about

      10   that line, so midway up to the office.

      11        Q    Okay.  So in the break between

      12   Section 2 and 3 at some point the opening was

      13   expanded from the original opening you told us

      14   about all the way up to the office almost?

      15        A    I believe so, yes.

      16        Q    Okay.  And approximately when did

      17   that occur?

      18        A    I believe it was when we added the

      19   back section on.

      20        Q    Okay.  And when did that occur?

      21        A    So I think that, I believe that was

      22   around 2004.

      23        Q    All right.

      24        A    And, again, the dates --


                                                        33




       1        Q    That's fine, it's approximate,

       2   that's fine.

       3             And then at some point did the

       4   company take over, either through lease or

       5   through purchase, what I'll call Units 4, 5,

       6   and 6?

       7        A    Okay.  Which way are you going here?

       8        Q    Up to you, let's be consistent,

       9   so --

      10        A    I think you said this was 6; right?

      11        Q    Okay.  Let's say that was the first

      12   unit you bought, was 6?

      13        A    (Indicating.)

      14        Q    So the record is clear, the witness

      15   just numbered the units from --

      16        A    That we are going to use for this.

      17        Q    For this purpose, sure.  Just to be

      18   clear we, the original unit you bought was?

      19        A    We bought 4, 5 and 6.

      20        Q    You first occupied 6?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Then you eventually bought 4, 5, and

      23   6.  How about Units 1, 2, and 3, did they come

      24   into the possession of the company at some


                                                        34




       1   point?

       2        A    Yes, about a year later.  And then

       3   we did not do anything with those at the

       4   beginning, we had tenants in there.

       5        Q    All right.  And when, if ever, did

       6   the tenants leave and Clemens start using

       7   those for operations?

       8        A    Again, these dates are going to be,

       9   so I believe somewhere around 2000, Intertech

      10   had -- they had 1, 2, and 3.  Okay?  And then

      11   we bought the entire building and then they

      12   were our tenants, Intertech was our single

      13   tenant.  And then they built a building and

      14   moved out.  And then at that point when they

      15   moved out, we took Unit 3 and then we had two

      16   separate tenants in 1 and 2.

      17        Q    Okay.  And when you started to

      18   occupy Unit No. 3, were there any kind of

      19   punchouts put in the wall?

      20        A    There was a very small one here,

      21   I'll just say 10 feet by 10 feet.

      22        Q    Okay.

      23        A    There was nothing put in here or

      24   anything here.  The reason that that was


                                                        35




       1   put -- the reason that we couldn't open this

       2   whole thing up, this is a separates level.

       3        Q    Okay.

       4        A    The floor was like, I'm going to

       5   say, 3 feet lower.  So this had, 1, 2, and 3

       6   had a lower floor level, and then this had a

       7   higher floor level.

       8        Q    All right.

       9        A    So we didn't -- we couldn't use it

      10   for production.  We used that for our

      11   warehouse.

      12        Q    And did you ever expand your

      13   business beyond Unit 3 into 2 and 1?

      14        A    So 2 was never, never, ever a

      15   possession of ours.  Just the tenant.  And

      16   then 1 at the end was, we were using that for

      17   some warehouse, but it was basically empty at

      18   the time of the fire.

      19        Q    Okay.

      20        A    Because we were planning on moving

      21   the other people over.

      22        Q    And that had not occurred?

      23        A    (Witness shakes head.)

      24        Q    All right.  You have to say yes or


                                                        36




       1   no for the record.

       2        A    Yes.  Sorry.

       3        Q    Now, you mentioned at some point in

       4   or about 2004 there was an addition put on the

       5   building.  Can you just like put an outline

       6   there of where that was?

       7        A    (Indicating.)

       8        Q    All right.  And I want to talk now

       9   for a moment about what I'll call the parking

      10   lot side of the building.  Okay?  There were a

      11   series of garage doors at the rear of the

      12   property.  Can you tell us where those garage

      13   doors were at the time of the fire, where were

      14   those openings?

      15        A    So you're talking loading dock

      16   doors, garage doors, drive-in doors, what type

      17   of doors are you talking about?

      18        Q    Well, the way I asked the question

      19   was garage doors.  Okay?  But maybe a better

      20   way is if you could just describe for us,

      21   starting at one end or the other, whichever

      22   you're comfortable with, what were the

      23   openings that were available at the back of

      24   the building, let's say the day before the


                                                        37




       1   fire?

       2        A    Okay.  I believe that there were

       3   four drive-in doors on the building.

       4        Q    Okay.  And just so we're clear, if

       5   we look at the addition which is at the back

       6   of Unit 6, there was one of the doors there;

       7   right?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    And the addition kind of split Unit

      10   No. 4 in half; is that correct?

      11        A    Correct.

      12        Q    All right.  And then there's a

      13   garage door at the back of Unit 4 and next to

      14   it there's a garage door in Unit 3, and

      15   there's a garage door in Unit 1; is that

      16   correct?

      17        A    Yeah, but I just think there was one

      18   in 5, so.

      19        Q    Okay.

      20        A    I'm pretty sure of that, yeah.

      21        Q    So there was, in the addition there

      22   were two garage doors, one at the back of 6

      23   and one at the back of 5?

      24        A    Correct.


                                                        38




       1        Q    All right.  So are you familiar with

       2   that there was one of the Sprinter vans, that

       3   the allegation is that the fire started in

       4   that van?

       5        A    Correct.

       6        Q    And are you familiar with the spot

       7   where that van was sitting on the day of the

       8   fire?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    Could you please put, just put an S

      11   for the Sprinter?

      12        A    These will be approximate, but.

      13        Q    And then there was another vehicle

      14   which was parked, if we were standing at the

      15   back, it would have been parked to its right;

      16   is that correct?

      17        A    I believe, I'm not sure if it was

      18   this way or the other way.

      19        Q    Okay.  And is it accurate that there

      20   was a ramp that went from the parking lot up

      21   to that garage door where the two trucks were

      22   parked?

      23        A    Correct.

      24        Q    All right.  Now, in this building


                                                        39




       1   there was a time clock for the employees; is

       2   that correct?

       3        A    Correct.

       4        Q    Could you just put on the diagram

       5   like a TC for time clock for me?

       6        A    (Indicating.)

       7                  MR. BLUM:  Could we mark that

       8        as Exhibit 5, please.

       9                       - - -

      10                  (Copy of color photograph

      11        marked R. Clemens Exhibit 5.)

      12                       - - -

      13   BY MR. BLUM:

      14        Q    I'm going to show you a photograph,

      15   and we marked this as Exhibit 5.  I asked you

      16   about the time clock and you indicated a spot

      17   where it was on the building.  Is the time

      18   clock that we talked about in that photograph?

      19        A    Yep.

      20        Q    Okay.  And is that a fairly accurate

      21   picture of what the inside of the facility

      22   would have looked like the day before the

      23   fire?

      24        A    At that section, yeah.


                                                        40




       1        Q    And if we're looking --

       2        A    And this is an optical illusion,

       3   because this is a rail here, so there's a --

       4   this is a walkway here and there is a walkway

       5   here that you can't -- like it looks like this

       6   is all on top of each other.  But this is an

       7   optical illusion because this is higher than

       8   what the things are here.  This rail is a lot

       9   higher.

      10        Q    Okay.  When you're talking about the

      11   rail, you're talking about the metal piping

      12   that's hanging down?

      13        A    Yeah.

      14        Q    And approximately, if I was standing

      15   there, how high up would that railing be?

      16        A    Above your head.

      17        Q    All right.  So and then if we're

      18   looking at this photograph, if you like look

      19   into the distance away from the photograph,

      20   there is an opening that appears there.  Is

      21   that correct?

      22        A    Correct.  That's what I was

      23   (indicating) I had marked there.

      24        Q    So that's my question, is that this


                                                        41




       1   opening here?

       2        A    No.

       3        Q    It's this opening here?

       4        A    Yeah.  This is a man door in the

       5   office.

       6        Q    Okay.  And just so I'm clear, the

       7   space between -- the wall between space 4 and

       8   5 was fairly open --

       9        A    Right.

      10        Q    -- at the time of the fire?

      11        A    Correct.

      12        Q    Okay.  Now, at some point there were

      13   a series of security cameras that were

      14   installed in this property; is that correct?

      15        A    Correct.

      16        Q    And when were those installed?

      17        A    I do not know.  Prior to the fire.

      18        Q    Years before or shortly before?

      19        A    I don't really recall.  They have

      20   the -- the State Police took the camera

      21   things, so there might be something that they

      22   could get the date of the serial number off of

      23   that.  I don't really recall.

      24        Q    Okay.  And do you recall who the


                                                        42




       1   company was that installed it?

       2        A    As far as the equipment in the

       3   office?

       4        Q    Like the actual physical cameras and

       5   everything, who came here and put that in?

       6        A    We did that ourselves, I believe.

       7        Q    Okay.  And where did you purchase

       8   the equipment from?

       9        A    I don't recall.

      10        Q    And did you personally do the work

      11   or did somebody else do it?

      12        A    I didn't personally do it, no.

      13        Q    And can you tell me like -- I don't

      14   know what to call it -- but there would have

      15   been like a base unit or a DVR that actually

      16   captured the video, can you tell us where that

      17   was located?

      18        A    I believe it was in Unit 4,

      19   somewhere in that area.

      20        Q    Okay.  Just so we're clear, the

      21   witness put an X in Unit 4 where he believes

      22   the base unit was located.  Okay.

      23             And do you recall where the cameras

      24   were throughout the facility?  Why don't you


                                                        43




       1   put a C where they are?

       2        A    (Indicating.)  I don't even know how

       3   many there were, but that will be the only

       4   ones -- I think what we wanted to do, we

       5   wanted to shine on the back parking lot and

       6   then I think we wanted to shine down the side

       7   street.  And then this one hit our front door,

       8   and the one was where the main base was, and

       9   then the one was at the time clock.

      10        Q    Just so we're clear, you put, is it

      11   2 or 3 that were on the parking lot side?

      12        A    Three, I believe.  But it might have

      13   been one here and one there.

      14        Q    Okay.

      15        A    So on the -- there is video from

      16   there.  Do you know how many was on there?

      17        Q    I believe there's eight.

      18        A    Oh.  If I would be able to look at

      19   the thing, I would be able to tell you where

      20   they are, the shots from there.

      21        Q    Okay, great.

      22        A    So then it would be probably this

      23   way.

      24        Q    I don't want you to guess.  Okay?


                                                        44




       1        A    All right.

       2        Q    If those are the ones you

       3   remember --

       4        A    If you showed me the cameras, I can

       5   tell you where they're shot at.

       6        Q    Okay.  And what led the company to

       7   put that system in?

       8        A    We had some issues with kids outside

       9   doing different things, and then we also had

      10   problems where one employee would punch

      11   somebody else in or out.

      12        Q    Okay.  And at the time that this

      13   security system was put in, was there any

      14   discussions about putting in any kind of fire

      15   alarms?

      16        A    No.

      17        Q    Had the company ever discussed

      18   putting in a fire alarm of any type in the

      19   building?

      20        A    Fire alarm?

      21        Q    Yes.

      22        A    No.

      23        Q    Why not?

      24        A    I don't know.


                                                        45




       1        Q    Okay.  Who would be the person who

       2   would know that?

       3        A    Myself would be involved in that

       4   decision.

       5        Q    And would you be acting on behalf of

       6   like the owner of the building when you made a

       7   decision to either put an alarm in or not put

       8   an alarm in?

       9        A    No.

      10        Q    Who would you be acting on behalf

      11   of?

      12        A    Tenant.

      13        Q    Okay.  And was there ever any

      14   discussions about putting any sprinkler

      15   systems in the building?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    When did that discussion take place?

      18        A    When we were looking at remodeling

      19   the entire building.

      20        Q    And when did that take place, that

      21   discussion?

      22        A    I would say 2000 -- prior to the

      23   fire.

      24        Q    Okay.  Like how long before the


                                                        46




       1   fire?

       2        A    I don't know.

       3        Q    Weeks, months, years?

       4        A    It was part of the ongoing remodel

       5   plan, so let's just say less than one year.

       6        Q    All right.  And the remodel plan

       7   you're talking about, was that something that

       8   was in writing?

       9        A    As far as the equipment that we

      10   were -- we were in design phase with the

      11   equipment manufacturer.

      12        Q    Okay.  So let me try to clarify.  So

      13   when you talked about the redesign, were you

      14   talking about redesign of the physical

      15   building or redesign of the equipment or a

      16   combination?

      17        A    Redesign of the interior of the

      18   building and equipment.

      19        Q    Okay.  And had you hired, I'll call

      20   it, outside consultants or someone to work

      21   with you on that?

      22        A    We had some design drawings,

      23   preliminary design drawings made.

      24        Q    And who was that done by?


                                                        47




       1        A    White Conveyer.

       2        Q    I'm sorry, say it again?

       3        A    White Conveyer.

       4        Q    And what type of business is White

       5   Conveyer in?

       6        A    Conveyer.

       7        Q    Okay.  And so that would have been a

       8   preliminary design of like conveyer systems

       9   that would have moved the laundry like inside

      10   the building?

      11        A    Sorting system.

      12        Q    Sorting, okay.  And had you obtained

      13   pricing from anyone about that sorting system?

      14        A    I do not know if it was that far

      15   along.  I know we had preliminary design

      16   drawings because we were trying to figure out

      17   how many square feet it would take.

      18        Q    And had you consulted with anyone

      19   else other than White Conveyer about

      20   remodeling of the inside of the building?

      21        A    As far as taking, moving walls and

      22   things like that?

      23        Q    Sure.

      24        A    We had just discussions with our


                                                        48




       1   builder, Fenster Construction.

       2        Q    And when did those discussions take

       3   place?

       4        A    That would probably be in the same

       5   time period that I was talking about, with the

       6   year.

       7        Q    And that would have been within a

       8   year of the fire occurring?

       9        A    Yes, uh-huh.

      10        Q    Okay.  And during those discussions

      11   was there a discussion of adding a sprinkler

      12   system to the building?

      13        A    He had mentioned, I believe it was

      14   Chris, had mentioned that if we would want to

      15   do what we had talked about, opening up the

      16   entire building, then we'd be required to get

      17   sprinklers because it would raise up, go above

      18   the square footage threshold.

      19        Q    Okay.  So Chris is somebody who

      20   works at the construction company?

      21        A    Correct.

      22        Q    What is his last name?

      23        A    Zaun, Z-A-U-N.

      24        Q    And was there ever any discussion


                                                        49




       1   other than that about the sprinkler system

       2   about putting in fire alarms in the building?

       3        A    Not that I recall.

       4        Q    And when you said we had those

       5   discussions, was it you or was it you and

       6   Janet or somebody else who had those

       7   discussions about the redesign of the interior

       8   of the building?

       9        A    I don't know if Janet was involved

      10   or not.  You asked about, I said Chris, I

      11   meant we, Chris and I.

      12        Q    Okay.  Now, as Clemens started to

      13   expand through the different sections of the

      14   building, did you have to upgrade portions of

      15   the electrical systems in the building?

      16        A    No.

      17        Q    Okay.

      18        A    Each electrical system had their own

      19   separate panel.

      20        Q    All right.  And did you ever have

      21   any electrical contractors who did any work in

      22   the building for you?

      23        A    Well, they had to when they did,

      24   redesigned the -- I shouldn't say redesign,


                                                        50




       1   when they added the --

       2        Q    Addition?

       3        A    -- addition.

       4        Q    Okay.  And that took place in 2004;

       5   is that correct?

       6        A    About then.  If -- that date may be

       7   correct.

       8        Q    Okay.  And what was the purpose of

       9   the addition in 2004?

      10        A    We needed additional space.

      11        Q    And what did you need that

      12   additional space for?

      13        A    Loading and unloading.

      14        Q    And so tell me what was in the

      15   addition when it was completed?

      16        A    There was a -- so there was a dryer,

      17   a washer, a DAF, and a water tank.

      18        Q    Okay.  You have to excuse my

      19   ignorance, but what is a DAF?

      20        A    It's a wastewater treatment system,

      21   dissolved air flotation, so, in other words,

      22   it makes the dirt float to the top of the

      23   water.

      24        Q    Okay.  And the washer and the dryer

       1   that were installed at the back of Units 4 and

       2   5, were they new equipment at the time of

       3   the --

       4        A    Everything was new.

       5                  MR. BLUM:  Okay.  Why don't we

       6        take a break for a minute.

       7                  MR. SLATTERY:  Sure.

      11   BY MR. BLUM:

      12        Q    Randy, we talked for minute about

      13   the video system.  Can you tell me like who

      14   would the people have been at the company who

      15   would have worked on that, like physically

      16   done the work?

      17        A    I believe that a gentleman, John

      18   Camioni.

      19        Q    And can you spell his last name for

      20   me?

      21        A    C-A-M-A-I-N-O.

      22        Q    Okay.  Is he still employed here?

      23        A    No.

      24        Q    And I'm sorry, yes, he is?


                                                        52




       1        A    No.

       2        Q    And when did he leave?

       3        A    Possibly around 2017.

       4        Q    And what was John's position at the

       5   company?

       6        A    He worked in the office.

       7        Q    And what kind of work did he do?

       8        A    He was the daily accounting.

       9        Q    Okay.  Do you know where he lived?

      10        A    Gilbertsville.

      11        Q    I want to go back to the diagram

      12   which we marked as, I think it was Exhibit 4,

      13   if we could.  And I'm going to ask you to

      14   switch colors, give you a black pen, so if we

      15   go back to where the Sprinter van was parked,

      16   can you tell me if we're standing at the back,

      17   looking at it from the back, what would have

      18   been to the left of that van?

      19        A    So we're standing at the back

      20   looking in?

      21        Q    Yes.

      22        A    We're standing right here?

      23        Q    Yes, right there looking in, what

      24   would have been in that area right there?


                                                        53




       1        A    Mat storage.

       2        Q    Okay.  And what did that mat storage

       3   look like?

       4        A    Rolled up floor mats on racks.  If

       5   you look out in our building out here, you can

       6   see exactly what it looks like.

       7        Q    Okay.  How high would that rack have

       8   gone?

       9        A    Just estimate, I would say 8 feet.

      10        Q    And at the end of the day when

      11   people are getting ready to walk out from the

      12   day of work, would that mat storage have been

      13   filled or would it be empty typically?

      14        A    There was always mats on it.

      15        Q    Okay.  And are those new mats or are

      16   they mats that have been like used and cleaned

      17   and ready to go?

      18        A    Used, clean, ready to go.

      19        Q    And if we went forward from those

      20   mats, like towards the offices, what would

      21   have been in that space, number 4?

      22        A    Clean garment storage.

      23        Q    Okay.  And so it would have been

      24   clean garment storage all the way from the


                                                        54




       1   front of the vehicles to the office wall?

       2        A    So this would be a sorting conveyer

       3   and then this would be clean garment storage.

       4        Q    Okay.  And could you describe for us

       5   what that clean garment storage looked like?

       6        A    Your closet.

       7        Q    Okay.  And was it on metal racks?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    Stationary metal racks or movable?

      10        A    Stationary.

      11        Q    And would it have been one level or

      12   more than one level?

      13        A    Two.

      14        Q    Okay.  And how high would the

      15   highest level have been?

      16        A    6 feet, something like that.

      17        Q    Okay.  And the way you drew that, it

      18   looks like the clothes would have been

      19   parallel to the side walls, like the racks, is

      20   that accurate, that they ran front to back?

      21        A    As the drawing.

      22        Q    And did they go all the way across

      23   the whole width of that space, the unit?

      24        A    I would say it's more so as the


                                                        55




       1   drawing, so, in other words, I don't know

       2   exactly, but there was definitely not -- it

       3   wasn't the whole way.

       4        Q    Okay.  And at the end of the day

       5   would those racks typically have been full or

       6   empty or partially full?

       7        A    Partially full.

       8        Q    Okay.  And then if we go over to

       9   Unit 5, where this opening is or was in the

      10   wall there, can you tell me what was present

      11   in Unit 5?

      12        A    (Indicating.)  So this is what we

      13   would call a steam tunnel, which is where all

      14   the uniforms went through, and then there was

      15   the dry cleaning presses, which would be the

      16   shirt unit and pants press for your executive

      17   wear.  And then in the middle I believe there

      18   was two tables.  But that's all just from

      19   vague memory.

      20        Q    Okay.  And you said dry cleaning

      21   unit.  Were there clothes that were actually

      22   dry cleaned in the premises?

      23        A    Yes.  But those were what we call

      24   dry cleaning presses, is that it's


                                                        56




       1   separately -- so everything is washed here,

       2   the washers were over here, and then this

       3   would be like shirts that you're wearing, like

       4   dress shirts.  So dress shirts, like shirts

       5   like you're wearing have to be washed, they

       6   can't be dry cleaned.

       7        Q    Okay.  So there was not what I'll

       8   call dry cleaning at that spot, it was just

       9   pressing of those types of clothes?

      10        A    Right.  We call it dry clean presses

      11   because it looked --

      12        Q    Looked like it?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    Were there any dry cleaning

      15   facilities in this plant at all?

      16        A    (Indicating.)

      17        Q    Can you mark that for me.

      18        A    (Indicating.)

      19        Q    All right.  And what was done in

      20   that dry cleaning spot, what kind of clothes

      21   or what was cleaned there?

      22        A    So if we would have stained

      23   garments, things that we couldn't get clean in

      24   the regular laundry facility.


                                                        57




       1        Q    Okay.  And were there various

       2   solvents or materials that went along with

       3   that dry cleaning aspect of the business?

       4        A    Well, I mean, they're in that

       5   machine.

       6        Q    And where was the storage for those

       7   materials?

       8        A    In the machine.

       9        Q    Okay.  And were there, was there

      10   extra like drums or --

      11        A    No.

      12        Q    It wasn't stored anywhere?

      13        A    No.  So when they deliver, it goes

      14   right into the machine.

      15        Q    Okay.  And what was in that machine,

      16   what was the solvents that were in it, if you

      17   know?

      18        A    Perchloroethylene.

      19        Q    Do you know the manufacturer of that

      20   equipment, the dry cleaning equipment?

      21        A    Multimatic.

      22        Q    And who was the supplier of the

      23   solvents?

      24        A    I don't know.  We have had several


                                                        58




       1   suppliers.  I don't know.

       2        Q    Okay.

       3        A    You can get that from any dry

       4   cleaner supplier.

       5        Q    Right.  But when they came here like

       6   with a truck and delivered it, right into the

       7   machine?

       8        A    Uh-huh.

       9        Q    You have to say yes or no.

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    And do you know when the last

      12   delivery was before the fire occurred?

      13        A    No.

      14        Q    Now, just in terms of the general

      15   operations in this facility, where was the

      16   main laundry area, like where the things were

      17   really washed?

      18        A    (Indicating.)  So that would be in

      19   Unit 6.

      20        Q    And you put four washing machines

      21   there; is that accurate?

      22        A    I believe that's what we had.  I

      23   don't remember.

      24        Q    And how old were those washing


                                                        59




       1   machines, how long had they been in there?

       2        A    Oh, various years.

       3        Q    Were they all used in the same

       4   manner or were some of them used for like

       5   clothes and others were used for the --

       6        A    No.  Same, did everything.  Each one

       7   had, you can just program the different

       8   formulas, and all the formulas were the same,

       9   so you could wash shirts in one, linens in the

      10   other one, then tomorrow you can wash linens

      11   and shirts, it doesn't matter.

      12        Q    And how about the rugs that came in,

      13   were they processed in those machines as well?

      14        A    Throughout the time they were.  We

      15   generally used this one here in our addition,

      16   and this one here because they were the

      17   largest two.  So we had so many mats.

      18        Q    Okay.  Just so we're clear, because

      19   you said this one here, it's not clear on the

      20   record, so you were talking about the new one

      21   which was in the addition and the one that was

      22   at the extreme back of Unit 6; is that

      23   correct?

      24        A    Correct.


                                                        60




       1        Q    All right.  And then after the

       2   things came out of those washing machines, did

       3   they go into dryers of some sort?

       4        A    So there was a dryer back here.

       5        Q    Which is in the addition; right?

       6        A    Right, in the addition.  And then --

       7   and this isn't to scale, but we had maybe

       8   three or four dryers in Section 6.

       9        Q    Can you just put a D next to those

      10   or dryer?

      11        A    (Indicating.)

      12        Q    And just so we're clear in terms of

      13   process, so if the driver came in here where

      14   that Sprinter was and he unloaded his --

      15        A    Here's where he unloaded.

      16        Q    All right.  So you marked at the

      17   back --

      18        A    Unload.

      19        Q    -- of Unit 5?

      20        A    Yes.

      21        Q    All right.  So was it the procedure

      22   that they would come into the back of Unit 5

      23   and unload all their dirty materials?

      24        A    Correct.


                                                        61




       1        Q    And what did they do with them?

       2        A    They put them in carts.

       3        Q    And then was there someone who was

       4   responsible for taking those carts and putting

       5   the material then into the dirty side, the

       6   laundry portion?

       7        A    Uh-huh.

       8        Q    After the clothes came out of the

       9   dryers, where did they go?

      10        A    This, I didn't draw this to scale,

      11   but there was a linen ironer here in Unit 6,

      12   so that's where the linens would go.  And then

      13   the uniforms would go into the steam tunnel.

      14        Q    Okay.  And after the uniforms came

      15   out of the steam tunnel, what happened to

      16   them?

      17        A    They went on conveyer over to the

      18   sorting area in Unit 4.  And then they went

      19   onto the storage rails in Unit 4.

      20        Q    Okay.  And that conveyer, did that

      21   just move everything together and the humans

      22   actually sort it or was that conveyer used to

      23   somehow help sort the different types of

      24   uniforms?


                                                        62




       1        A    Just transportation.

       2        Q    And what would have been taking

       3   place in Unit 3?

       4        A    Unit 3 was storage.  So this would

       5   be pallet racks in those two areas.

       6        Q    Okay.  So those would have been

       7   pallet racks in Unit 3?

       8        A    Uh-huh.

       9        Q    And what would have been on those

      10   pallet racks?

      11        A    Oh, could have been out of service

      12   linens, new towels, could have been detergent.

      13   I would say that would probably be the basic

      14   of it.

      15        Q    And on any given day, do you know

      16   the percentage of like your uniforms that were

      17   on the premises versus that were off?

      18        A    I do not know that percentage.

      19        Q    And could we determine that somehow

      20   by looking at the books and records?

      21        A    I would imagine that our computer

      22   system would be able to tell you in service,

      23   out of service garments.  And then it would

      24   also -- so the only thing that we wouldn't --


                                                        63




       1   we scanned the garments, but we lost all the

       2   information from the day of the fire.  So we

       3   knew how many garments were in the place that

       4   were picked up the Friday before the fire, the

       5   Thursday before the fire.  But the day of the

       6   fire those never got scanned, so that was a

       7   very difficult thing for when we had to

       8   replace those garments, because we didn't have

       9   that information for that day.

      10        Q    And can you tell me, though,

      11   typically if a truck came in today and it had

      12   like dirty uniforms from a restaurant, how

      13   long did those stay on the premises?  Would

      14   they be there just a day and they were back

      15   out or would they --

      16        A    Week, week.

      17        Q    So in general like the inventory for

      18   a company would have been there for a week?

      19        A    Correct.

      20        Q    Okay.  And how about in terms of the

      21   mats, did they cycle in a typical fashion?

      22        A    So we have on the mat customers, you

      23   have a choice of going weekly or every other

      24   week.


                                                        64




       1        Q    Okay.

       2        A    So that we would exchange some

       3   people's mats on a weekly basis, and other

       4   people's are every two weeks.

       5        Q    In terms of uniforms, were there new

       6   uniforms that were held in inventory, or did

       7   you buy them, like if you had a new customer

       8   come on, you would just go out and buy them

       9   and add them to the cycle?

      10        A    Oh, there was always new -- so we

      11   always had both.  So, in other words, if we

      12   need a size that we don't have, we would order

      13   that, you know, immediately.  But your common

      14   things, we would have that, you know, Navy

      15   blue pants and things like that.

      16        Q    And where were those stored?

      17        A    I believe that would have been in

      18   this area here.

      19        Q    You don't have to mark it, so it

      20   would have been in the --

      21        A    Unit 4.

      22        Q    In Unit 4 in the front of the office

      23   area or in the office area?

      24        A    Well, it would have been, some would


                                                        65




       1   have been in and some would have been above.

       2        Q    When you say above, you mean like it

       3   actually would have been stored on the ceiling

       4   of Unit 4?

       5        A    Yeah.  There was the storage for the

       6   garments was above the offices.

       7        Q    Okay.  So if we go back to the

       8   photograph we marked as Exhibit 5, this is the

       9   storage area up here above the offices that

      10   you're speaking of?

      11        A    Uh-huh.

      12        Q    Okay.  And so would it have been --

      13   I'm sorry, you have to say yes or no for the

      14   record.

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    And is it accurate that there would

      17   have been storage all the way across the

      18   ceilings in all the units or just in Unit 4?

      19        A    Well, okay.  This is Unit 6, so you

      20   can see there's storage there.  So, yes, I

      21   mean, it was across those units.

      22        Q    So it would have been clearly across

      23   4, 5, and 6.  And what about on 3?

      24        A    I believe, yes, there was, there was


                                                        66




       1   three steps going down to that area, I

       2   believe.

       3        Q    Okay.  And was there an office or an

       4   area where the embroidery was handled?

       5        A    That was in Unit 6.

       6        Q    Okay.  And tell me the types of

       7   equipment that they had in that office?  Was

       8   that in the office area of Unit 6?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    Tell me what types of equipment they

      11   had in that area?

      12        A    Embroidery machine.

      13        Q    Okay.  And was there also

      14   machines -- again I don't know what the right

      15   words are, but -- wasn't necessarily

      16   embroidery but where it could have been

      17   pressed-on type or heated-on type of logos?

      18        A    Are you talking about like silk

      19   screening?

      20        Q    I guess.  You tell me.

      21        A    Okay.  Well, we had silk screening

      22   was in the office area of Unit 3.

      23        Q    Okay.  So tell me what was in that

      24   office?  What type of an -- and excuse my


                                                        67




       1   ignorance -- what is used to do silk

       2   screening?

       3        A    So you print the shirt and then you

       4   run it through a dryer that cures it, so that

       5   when you wash it, it doesn't come off.

       6        Q    And what kind of a dryer, what kind

       7   of a unit is that?

       8        A    It's a small dryer with a conveyor

       9   on it.

      10        Q    And does it use like heat lamps or

      11   what kind of element does it use to heat or

      12   dry?

      13        A    It uses heat.  I don't know what

      14   kind of heat.

      15        Q    And do you know what type of

      16   equipment or how long that equipment had been

      17   there in Unit 3?

      18        A    No.

      19        Q    In terms of the customers of the

      20   business, what types of business are the

      21   customers, your customers typically in?

      22        A    So a lot of them are in

      23   manufacturing, service businesses, food

      24   service businesses, food manufacturing


                                                        68




       1   businesses, nursing, some nursing homes.

       2        Q    And was there any portion of the

       3   business that handled what I'll call soiled

       4   rags coming back from businesses?

       5        A    Was there any -- say that again?

       6        Q    Did you handle soiled rags of any

       7   type for any businesses?

       8        A    Correct.

       9        Q    Yes, you did?

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    Okay.  And what types of businesses

      12   were those coming from?

      13        A    Auto mechanics, they are our biggest

      14   user of those type of rags.

      15        Q    Was there any rags that came back

      16   from manufacturing businesses?

      17        A    They don't generally use, I mean,

      18   most of the red rags are used, if they're used

      19   in manufacturing, they're used for the

      20   maintenance.

      21        Q    Okay.  And so did any of, as we sit

      22   here today, do you remember any of your

      23   manufacturing clients that sent rags back from

      24   maintenance on their equipment?


                                                        69




       1        A    No, I don't -- I mean, I'd have to

       2   look at a list.

       3        Q    Okay.  And what list would you look

       4   at?

       5        A    Customer list.  And I would have to

       6   check to see if they got red shop towels or

       7   whatever.

       8        Q    Okay.  And if shop towels came back

       9   in on any given day, where did they get

      10   stored, the dirty shop towels?

      11        A    Right here in like Unit 6 area, 5,

      12   6.

      13        Q    All right.  By what you called, was

      14   it the DAF unit?

      15        A    Yes.  So this would be your area

      16   (indicating).

      17        Q    Can you just write "rags" there for

      18   me.

      19        A    I don't know if that was rags, I'm

      20   just saying that's where they could be.

      21        Q    Okay.  And they came in, how would

      22   they be handled, the dirty rags, do they go

      23   into bins or --

      24        A    Yes, bins.


                                                        70




       1        Q    How about the floor mats, do any of

       2   those come back from manufacturing facilities?

       3        A    Yes, yes.  There's a lot of

       4   manufacturers that use them for their

       5   entrances, for their offices.  The biggest

       6   user of mats would be like a company like

       7   here, you would have them at the front door

       8   and then you would have it from where the

       9   manufacturing backed into the office.  So, in

      10   other words, everyone wants to protect the

      11   office and keep the entrance nice.

      12        Q    Okay.  And as we sit here today, do

      13   you remember any of the manufacturers who you

      14   did rug service for?

      15        A    No.  I'd have to look at a list.

      16        Q    Prior to the fire in June of 2016,

      17   had there ever been any other fires on the

      18   premises?

      19        A    On the premises?

      20        Q    Yes.

      21        A    We had a towel, small towel fire at

      22   one point.  And that was the only thing that

      23   ever happened, and that wasn't even in the

      24   premises.  That actually was, they pushed the


                                                        71




       1   cart outside and it was outside.

       2        Q    Okay.  And when you say a towel

       3   fire, tell me how that fire started?

       4        A    After they came out of the dryer,

       5   they were -- they took them out too hot and so

       6   they realized, that's when they pushed them

       7   outside.

       8        Q    When you say they took them out too

       9   hot, so was there basically like spontaneous

      10   combustion occurred in the pile of towels?

      11        A    I don't want to speculate on that.

      12        Q    Okay.  And after that incident

      13   occurred, was there ever any discussion of

      14   adding any type of fire suppression equipment

      15   in the building?

      16        A    No.  The dryers have it on, and

      17   the -- they didn't let the -- you know, if

      18   they would have left it in the dryer, it would

      19   have had the suppression system in the dryer.

      20        Q    Okay.  Other than the towel fire,

      21   any other fire on the premises that you can

      22   recall?

      23        A    In the building?

      24        Q    In the building, yes.


                                                        72




       1        A    I do not.

       2        Q    The purchase of new vehicles or the

       3   leasing of new vehicles by the company, who

       4   handles that?

       5        A    I would take care of that.

       6        Q    Okay.  And were you involved in the

       7   leasing of the Sprinter that's alleged to have

       8   started the fire?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    Can you tell me who you spoke to or

      11   who you went to to lease that vehicle?

      12        A    I don't recall the gentleman's name.

      13        Q    What is his company?

      14        A    Bergey's.

      15        Q    Okay.  And did you at any time visit

      16   the Mercedes dealership that that Sprinter

      17   came from?

      18        A    No.

      19        Q    Did you ever have any conversations

      20   with anyone at that Mercedes dealership about

      21   the purchase or lease of that vehicle?

      22        A    No.

      23        Q    Did you ever speak to anybody who

      24   worked for Mercedes about the purchase or


                                                        73




       1   lease of that vehicle?

       2        A    No.

       3        Q    When the vehicle was delivered, did

       4   you read any of the materials that came with

       5   the vehicle?

       6        A    No.

       7        Q    All right.

       8                  MR. BLUM:  If I could just mark

       9        as Exhibit 6 a copy of the lease, if we

      10        could.

      11                       - - -

      14        marked Exhibit 6.)

      15                       - - -

      16   BY MR. BLUM:

      17        Q    Randy, we've put in front of you a

      18   document that was marked as Exhibit 6 to your

      19   deposition.  I'm going to ask you if you have

      20   ever seen this before?

      21        A    I have not seen this one.

      22        Q    Okay.  It actually looks like this

      23   was signed by Paul.  Is that your father?

      24        A    Uh-huh.


                                                        74




       1        Q    And at the time of this lease in

       2   October of 2011, was Paul handling that

       3   portion of the business?

       4        A    He was involved in it, yes.

       5        Q    And did you have some type of an

       6   agreement with Bergey's about leasing vehicles

       7   from them, like as a fleet in general?

       8        A    We had other leases with them.

       9        Q    So was there just what I'll call

      10   stand-alone leases for each vehicle or was

      11   there any kind of a, what I'll call a fleet

      12   leasing agreement?

      13        A    Stand-alone.

      14        Q    Did you personally ever have any

      15   involvement with the use of the Sprinter that

      16   we're talking about?

      17        A    Not that I know of.

      18        Q    And prior to the fire occurring in

      19   2016, had anyone ever spoken to you about that

      20   vehicle?

      21        A    Yes.  It let us sit before, prior to

      22   the fire.

      23        Q    Okay.  What do you mean by that?

      24        A    It wouldn't start.

       1        Q    And who discussed that with you?

       2        A    I believe it was Brett.

       3        Q    And what did Brett tell you?

       4        A    Vehicle won't start.

       5        Q    And do you recall what was done, if

       6   anything, about that?

       7        A    We called Bergey's.

       8        Q    And did Bergey's come out and

       9   service the vehicle or what happened?

      10        A    They came out and picked the vehicle

      11   up.

      12        Q    Okay.  And do you know what happened

      13   after they picked it up?

      14        A    No.

      15        Q    And after the fire occurred, have

      16   you personally had any conversations with

      17   anyone from the dealership about that vehicle?

      18        A    Yes.

      19        Q    Who did you speak to about that?

      20        A    I do not know, but we had to get a

      21   copy of the lease for the -- I think it was

      22   Nationwide that was, so we could get paid for

      23   it.

      24        Q    Okay.  And when I said the


                                                        76




       1   dealership, I should have been more specific.

       2   Are you referring to Bergey's?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    Okay.  And after the fire did you

       5   have any conversation ever with any

       6   representative of Devon Euro Motor Cars where

       7   the vehicle came from?

       8        A    Never.

       9        Q    And did you have any conversation

      10   ever with anyone on behalf of Mercedes after

      11   the fire?

      12        A    I don't believe so.  But I talked to

      13   a few people that were here investigating the

      14   fire, so I don't know, it could have been

      15   Mercedes.  I don't know.

      16        Q    Okay.  And did you ever personally

      17   pick up the phone to call like Mercedes-Benz

      18   USA?

      19        A    No.

      20        Q    Did you ever try to talk to anybody

      21   at Mercedes-Benz Vans about the Vehicle?

      22        A    No.

      23        Q    How did you learn of the fire?

      24        A    The borough called.


                                                        77




       1        Q    Called you at home?

       2        A    Yeah.

       3        Q    Okay.  And did you respond to the

       4   fire?

       5        A    Did I come here?

       6        Q    Yes.

       7        A    Yes.

       8        Q    What time was it when you got here?

       9        A    I don't recall.  It was some time

      10   after midnight.

      11        Q    And what did you observe when you

      12   got here?

      13        A    The building was in complete flames.

      14        Q    And were you interviewed by anyone

      15   that night?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    Who were you interviewed by?

      18        A    So I believe that it was the chief,

      19   the fire chief, Jay Daveler, and they wanted

      20   me to show them in the building where there

      21   could be any possible flammable items.  And I

      22   took them to where our fork truck was and so

      23   they put a hose on the fork truck so the

      24   propane wouldn't explode.  And they wanted to


                                                        78




       1   know where there was any other kind of

       2   chemicals or anything like that.

       3        Q    Okay.  And where was the fork truck,

       4   where would that have been parked?

       5        A    So that was parked in Unit 4, right

       6   at the loading dock (indicating) -- I'm sorry,

       7   Unit 3 right at the loading dock, I apologize,

       8   right here.

       9        Q    But it was inside the building?

      10        A    Yup.

      11        Q    Okay.

      12        A    Right here.

      13        Q    Okay.  And what other locations did

      14   you tell them there could be any flammable

      15   liquids that they should be concerned about?

      16        A    I said we don't have any flammable

      17   things.  Then they were concerned about

      18   chemicals.

      19        Q    Okay.  And what other chemicals were

      20   on the property?

      21        A    So I asked him about the bleach, if

      22   they were concerned about that.  And they

      23   weren't real concerned about that.

      24             The sulfuric acid, they were


                                                        79




       1   concerned about that.

       2        Q    And where was that stored?

       3        A    That was just a drum right here

       4   (indicating).

       5        Q    And could you just mark that?

       6        A    It's right next to the DAF.

       7        Q    And what was the purpose of having

       8   sulfuric acid there?

       9        A    That lowers your pH to treat the

      10   water to go out to the sewer.

      11        Q    So is it used as part of the DAF

      12   unit?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    And where were the bleach and other

      15   detergents stored?

      16        A    They would be in (indicating), let's

      17   put "detergent."

      18        Q    And were those in 55-gallon drums?

      19        A    Yup.

      20        Q    Were they plastic?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Okay.  Do you remember being

      23   interviewed by anyone else the night of the

      24   fire?


                                                        80




       1        A    Yes.

       2        Q    Who else were you interviewed by?

       3        A    I believe it was the State Police.

       4        Q    And what, if anything, did they ask

       5   you?

       6        A    I don't recall.

       7        Q    Okay.  And --

       8        A    Oh, they wanted to know about the

       9   cameras, I do remember that.

      10        Q    Okay.  And what do you remember

      11   talking to them about?

      12        A    They wanted to know if we had

      13   cameras.

      14        Q    Okay.

      15        A    And I said, yes, we did.

      16        Q    And did they ask you where the, what

      17   I'll call the DVR base unit was?

      18        A    I don't even think they did at that

      19   time.

      20        Q    And after that --

      21        A    Because there was an active, you

      22   know, it was an active fire.  They knew they

      23   couldn't go in there then.

      24        Q    Right.  And after that first day,


                                                        81




       1   were you ever reinterviewed by anybody?

       2        A    I believe that the State Police did.

       3   But I am not sure.

       4        Q    And did anyone ever ask you whether

       5   you thought there was anyone who could have

       6   started the fire intentionally?

       7        A    I don't recall if that was one of

       8   the questions.

       9        Q    And were you ever concerned that

      10   there was anyone who started the fire

      11   intentionally?

      12        A    No.

      13        Q    Now, other than the main building,

      14   there are some other buildings like located in

      15   the same vicinity of the main building.  Were

      16   any of those owned by your family?

      17        A    By myself and my father.

      18        Q    Okay.  Which buildings are there

      19   that were owned by you?

      20        A    Just the one building directly

      21   behind.

      22        Q    Okay.  And what is like the address

      23   of that building or how --

      24        A    805 West 5th Street.


                                                        82




       1        Q    And how big is that building?

       2        A    63,000 square feet.

       3        Q    And before the fire was that

       4   building used or empty or --

       5        A    So we had moved our items out of

       6   Unit 1, we were using this for excess storage.

       7   And we moved our things out of Unit 1 into

       8   that building.

       9        Q    Before the fire?

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    And what was it that you moved, like

      12   you said excess.  What do you mean by that?

      13        A    So we import cage covers for

      14   pharmaceutical companies, and we get them in a

      15   container load at a time.  We also had hangers

      16   that we use for, we get those in trailer load

      17   at a time or half a trailer load.  So we put

      18   things like that in there.

      19        Q    I'm sorry, did you say cage covers?

      20        A    Yeah.

      21        Q    What do you mean by cage covers?

      22        A    So you know how you have an animal

      23   cage and the cover covers the animal cage.

      24        Q    And were those covers that you


                                                        83




       1   actually laundered for them or just sold?

       2        A    No; sold.

       3        Q    Was that business operated by

       4   Clemens Cleaning Village as well?

       5        A    It's not a business.  It's a

       6   product.

       7        Q    Okay.  Was that product sold by --

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    Okay.  When did you and your father

      10   purchase 805?

      11        A    I believe that it may have been

      12   October of 2015.

      13        Q    And prior to you purchasing that

      14   property, had there been some other tenant in

      15   there or somebody in there?

      16        A    Oh, there was two or three tenants

      17   maybe when we purchased it.

      18        Q    Okay.  And those tenants, did you at

      19   some point like end their leaseholds for them?

      20        A    No.

      21        Q    Okay.  Were those tenants still in

      22   the building when the fire occurred?

      23        A    Yes.  And additional tenants.

      24        Q    Say that again?


                                                        84




       1        A    And additional tenants.

       2        Q    Okay.  So after you had purchased

       3   it, you had added tenants to the property?

       4        A    Correct.

       5        Q    Okay.  And so how much of the space

       6   in that building of the 63,000 square feet,

       7   how much of it was open before the fire that

       8   your company was using?

       9        A    That we were using?

      10        Q    Yes.

      11        A    Oh, I mean, less than 4,000.

      12        Q    And after the fire occurred, did you

      13   then try to move some of the Clemens

      14   operations into that rear building?

      15        A    Absolutely.

      16        Q    And did you have any of the tenants

      17   leave or did those tenants stay in the

      18   property?

      19        A    They stayed.

      20        Q    And the ownership of that building,

      21   805, what's the name of the company or is

      22   there a partnership that owns that?

      23        A    Clemens Family, LP, I believe it is.

      24        Q    Now, before the fire occurred, was


                                                        85




       1   Clemens Cleaning Village paying rent to the

       2   building owner at the main building that we're

       3   here about?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    Okay.  And was there a written lease

       6   by which that payment was made?

       7        A    There was.

       8        Q    And do you have that or was that

       9   destroyed in the fire?

      10        A    That was destroyed in the fire.

      11        Q    And what was the amount of the rent

      12   per month at the time of the fire?

      13        A    I believe that it was $11,700, but I

      14   am not 100% sure.

      15        Q    Who would know that?

      16        A    I would think that Janet would know

      17   that.

      18        Q    Okay.  And other than paying a rent

      19   payment, did the tenant, Clemens Cleaning

      20   Village, have to pay any insurance or taxes or

      21   anything like that?

      22        A    Triple net.

      23        Q    It was triple net?

      24        A    Yeah, oh yeah.


                                                        86




       1        Q    And do you know what the taxes were

       2   that were being paid by Clemens Cleaning

       3   Village?

       4        A    No.

       5        Q    There was at least one tenant in the

       6   main building at the time of the fire; is that

       7   correct?

       8        A    Correct.

       9        Q    And what was the name of that

      10   tenant?

      11        A    I believe they went by S-Bond.  Only

      12   thing here it says MRI.  I think that was

      13   their original name, then they changed to

      14   S-Bond.

      15        Q    Was that like Material Resources or

      16   something like that?

      17        A    That's what -- here you have it

      18   listed or somebody has it listed as MRI.  But

      19   that is S-Bond.

      20        Q    Okay.  And do you know how much,

      21   what the amount of rent that was being paid by

      22   S-Bond before the fire?

      23        A    I believe it was around 18 to 19

      24   hundred dollars a month.


                                                        87




       1        Q    Triple net also?

       2        A    Oh, yeah.

       3        Q    And do you know how much longer they

       4   had left on their lease before the fire?

       5        A    I do not.

       6        Q    Had they been a long-term tenant in

       7   the building?

       8        A    Several years, I would say.

       9        Q    Well, at least their predecessor.

      10   That diagram goes back quite some time; right?

      11        A    Yeah, right.

      12        Q    So probably 15 years before the

      13   fire?

      14        A    I don't think it was that long.

      15        Q    Okay.  And what did you understand

      16   their business to be?

      17        A    So I think they specialized in

      18   bonding of dissimilar metals.

      19        Q    And did they perform the actual

      20   bonding or whatever process on the premises?

      21        A    So it was my understanding -- and I

      22   do not know, you'll have to ask them -- but I

      23   think that most of their business came from --

      24   what do you do when you lease the


                                                        88




       1   technology --

       2        Q    Licensing fees?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    Okay.

       5        A    I believe that's it.  I do not know.

       6   You would have to ask S-Bond that.

       7        Q    Okay.  So after the company moved

       8   its operations into their other building after

       9   the fire, tell me the steps that you recall

      10   taking to like keep the business operating?

      11        A    So the first thing was we had to

      12   figure out how we were going to keep our food

      13   processing companies in garments, because they

      14   can't operate without garments.  So at

      15   8 o'clock in the morning we were ordering

      16   replacement garments for the food processing

      17   companies, like lab coats and things like

      18   that.  And they have a warehouse in Allentown,

      19   so we -- at the time they did.  So then we set

      20   up an office in the back building and we got

      21   phone service switched to our cell phones.

      22             And just, it was like -- it was a

      23   huge mess.  I can't even recall the exact

      24   steps in it.


                                                        89




       1        Q    Did the company have any kind of

       2   written disaster or --

       3        A    No.

       4        Q    Just let me finish my question

       5   before you answer, okay?

       6             Did you have any kind of a written

       7   disaster recovery plan of any type?

       8        A    No.

       9                  MR. BLUM:  Let's take a break

      10        for five minutes.

      22   BY MR. BLUM:

      23        Q    Randy, I'm going to show you a

      24   document which we've marked as Exhibit 7 to


                                                        90




       1   your deposition.  Take a look at that and I'll

       2   have some specific questions.

       3             Take a look at the very last page

       4   for me, if you could.  Is that your signature

       5   that appears there?

       6        A    Yes.

       7        Q    And did you understand at the time

       8   you signed this that you were verifying that

       9   the answers in these Interrogatories were true

      10   and correct, to the best of your knowledge and

      11   belief?

      12        A    I believe that's what we had.

      13        Q    So yes, you did?

      14        A    Yes.

      15        Q    Okay.  I'm going to direct your

      16   attention, if we could, to Page 21,

      17   Interrogatory No. 84.  I'm going to ask you a

      18   series of questions about damages that are

      19   being claimed by, first by Clemens Cleaning

      20   Village that are above and beyond the

      21   insurance policy.  Okay?

      22        A    Uh-huh.

      23        Q    Again, this is not like a memory

      24   test.  I put this in front of you so that we


                                                        91




       1   have some background to review it from.

       2             So one of the things I believe that

       3   is being claimed here, if you look at the

       4   first paragraph, it says that you were insured

       5   with Harleysville for business personal

       6   property, do you see that, up to $2 million?

       7        A    Correct.

       8        Q    Is it your understanding that you --

       9   not you, but Clemens Cleaning Village -- was

      10   paid the policy limits available from

      11   Harleysville for the business personal

      12   property?

      13        A    I believe so.  But I am not 100%

      14   sure.

      15        Q    Okay.  And when those funds were

      16   paid to Clemens Cleaning Village, what did you

      17   do with them?

      18        A    They were deposited in our bank

      19   account.

      20        Q    And when they were deposited in the

      21   bank account, did you keep a separate running

      22   information about how or the equipment that

      23   you bought with those funds?

      24        A    I mean, there was replacement, we


                                                        92




       1   had everything coded for replacement, uniforms

       2   and so, for instance, when we were buying all

       3   the uniforms for replacement, we had that

       4   under a separate general ledger account.

       5        Q    Okay.

       6        A    So that if you had, like, say a

       7   customer was a new customer going down two

       8   months later, that was under a separate

       9   account because that was something that wasn't

      10   lost in the fire.

      11        Q    Okay.  But that section, the

      12   business personal property, also would have

      13   covered what I'll call the equipment, the

      14   operating equipment in the building.  Was that

      15   your understanding?

      16        A    No.  That's a separate -- you have

      17   to ask Janet, but that's a separate accounting

      18   thing.  Equipment is not under -- there's a

      19   separate accounting code for that.

      20        Q    Okay.  Under your books, I

      21   understand that.  But I mean under the

      22   insurance coverage, was it your understanding

      23   that Harleysville was the company that was

      24   reimbursing you for the actual equipment that


                                                        93




       1   was lost?

       2        A    I don't know that for a fact.  I

       3   don't know how they were paying or what they

       4   were paying.  They gave us the sheets of like

       5   the different calculations and they gave us

       6   the sheets as far as how they figured out the

       7   business interruption insurance, and so on and

       8   so forth.

       9        Q    Okay.

      10        A    So I think Harleysville would

      11   probably be better to answer that question for

      12   you.

      13        Q    Well, they can answer a piece of the

      14   question, which is what they wrote a check to

      15   you for.  Okay?  And so my two questions are,

      16   did you spend that 2 million replacing

      17   inventory and equipment?

      18        A    We spent that and a lot, lot more.

      19        Q    Okay.  So then that leads to the

      20   next question is, what is the amount, okay,

      21   for equipment and inventory that you believe

      22   the company was not reimbursed for?

      23        A    So I believe that would be the 993,

      24   if that includes everything that we're talking


                                                        94




       1   about or if that's -- you're talking about

       2   business interruption --

       3        Q    Yes.

       4        A    I'm sorry, I don't have that figure

       5   off the top of my head.

       6        Q    Okay.  So would you or Janet be the

       7   best person to ask those questions to?

       8        A    So I don't have it off the top of my

       9   head, maybe if I read through here, it would

      10   say what this --

      11        Q    Okay, you know what, there's two

      12   separate paragraphs there, one is for Clemens

      13   Cleaning Village and one is for P.R. Clemens.

      14   So I'm going to try to ask you a series of

      15   questions about Clemens Cleaning Village

      16   first, so why don't you take a minute and go

      17   ahead and read that, that first paragraph.

      18   Take your time.

      19        A    Okay.  I don't have it broken down

      20   in here.

      21        Q    Okay.  So --

      22        A    I would have to go back through our

      23   correspondence that would have -- I don't have

      24   that.

       1                  MR. SLATTERY:  What's the

       2        question?

       3   BY MR. BLUM:

       4        Q    Okay.  On --

       5        A    You want to know how much we spent

       6   for equipment over the amount that we were

       7   insured for?

       8        Q    My question really was both the

       9   equipment and the inventory, okay, so I want

      10   to know what you're claiming here is that

      11   difference?  I'm going to give you a minute to

      12   look at one other thing.

      13                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to mark as

      14        Exhibit 8, if we could, a copy of what

      15        I'm going to call the Jerry Hammar

      16        report.

      17                       - - -

      18                  (Hammar report, Bates numbers

      19        HWIC000849 through 000866, marked

      20        R. Clemens Exhibit 8.)

      21                       - - -

      22                  THE WITNESS:  So what I think

      23        that -- if you read this, if I'm reading

      24        correctly, this is what we're saying is


                                                        96




       1        the loss for -- at first I thought you

       2        were asking equipment, now you're asking

       3        equipment --

       4   BY MR. BLUM:

       5        Q    And inventory.

       6        A    But not business interruption?

       7        Q    That is correct.

       8        A    So I would have to --

       9                  MR. BLUM:  Let's go off the

      10        record.

      11                       - - -

      12                  (Discussion off the record.)

      13                       - - -

      14   BY MR. BLUM:

      15        Q    I put in front of you another

      16   document which is the Jerry Hammar report,

      17   which we've marked as Exhibit 8.  Have you

      18   ever seen this report before?

      19        A    Yes.

      20        Q    Okay.  What was your understanding

      21   of what this report showed?

      22        A    This is the report that shows every

      23   piece of equipment that we had in our location

      24   at the time of the fire.


                                                        97




       1        Q    All right.  And did you personally

       2   sit with Mr. Hammar, who prepared this report,

       3   to go through with him and talk about the

       4   various pieces of equipment that were present?

       5        A    Yes.

       6        Q    Okay.  And did you provide him with

       7   descriptions of the equipment?

       8        A    So he went and got the serial

       9   numbers off of the equipment where he could.

      10   He got the, did all the reference, you know,

      11   as far as, and he came back to me and there

      12   was one or two items that he couldn't find,

      13   like a purchase, like where to purchase it.

      14   And then we gave him, I gave him that

      15   information.  Like, I remember this recycle

      16   cake press, he couldn't find anything on that.

      17        Q    That's item number 17?

      18        A    Yes.

      19        Q    What is that?

      20        A    So after the sludge comes out of the

      21   wastewater, the DAF, then it gets pressed into

      22   there, and then it gets all the water out and

      23   then the cake is dropped down so then you can

      24   dispose of that.


                                                        98




       1        Q    Okay.  And do you remember what the

       2   other item was that he could not find?

       3        A    I don't recall the exact item that

       4   he was having trouble with.

       5        Q    Okay.  And before we came here

       6   today, at some point did Mr. Hammar provide

       7   you with a copy of this like before he

       8   finalized the report for you to review?

       9        A    He gave -- we sat down when he was

      10   trying to find everything out, and he asked

      11   like, where we bought these certain items

      12   because he wanted to have receipts, if

      13   possible.  Well, we didn't have the receipts

      14   because they were burned, so like some of the

      15   things he, you know, like I know that he

      16   wanted to get Pac's number and he wanted to

      17   get Frankford's number, because I think he was

      18   getting receipts or something from them.

      19        Q    And then after he compiled that

      20   information, did he give you like a

      21   preliminary version of this to review and say,

      22   "This is accurate, everything is included"?

      23        A    I do not believe so.  I believe that

      24   after that initial or second meeting with him,


                                                        99




       1   I mean, I didn't have any input on pricing or

       2   anything like that.

       3        Q    Okay.  And at some point did the

       4   insurance company provide you with a copy of

       5   this report?

       6        A    I believe it was similar to this

       7   report.

       8        Q    And when you got that copy, did you

       9   go through it?

      10        A    Just like I did here, yeah.

      11        Q    Well, today you did a very what I'll

      12   call cursory review?

      13        A    Right.

      14        Q    Did you at some point do what I'll

      15   call a detailed review of this report to see

      16   if it was accurate?

      17        A    So I went through and we, to make

      18   sure the equipment was on there and, you know,

      19   that was -- we made sure that we had

      20   everything that was on there, that it wasn't

      21   deleted or something.

      22        Q    So to the best of your knowledge,

      23   Mr. Hammar was accurate in obtaining a list of

      24   everything that was lost?


                                                       100




       1        A    Yes.

       2        Q    Okay.  So there's nothing, as we sit

       3   here today, where you would say, "Oh, by the

       4   way, Hammar missed the following three

       5   things"?

       6        A    I would say that you're correct.

       7        Q    All right.  And have you done

       8   anything to review or analyze the values that

       9   Mr. Hammar put on any of the property?

      10        A    I mean, he had the receipts for most

      11   of the things, and the other things that said

      12   estimate looked like they were fair to me.

      13        Q    Okay.  And were all the, let's say

      14   the washers and dryers and everything that

      15   were lost, they were ultimately replaced with

      16   new equipment; is that correct?

      17        A    Correct.

      18        Q    Okay.  And is the washing and drying

      19   capacity, like as we sit here today, in the

      20   new facility, is it larger, smaller, or the

      21   same as the capacity at the time of the fire?

      22        A    So it's a different configuration,

      23   but.

      24        Q    That's kind of why I asked it as


                                                       101




       1   capacity versus number of units; okay?

       2        A    Yeah.  I would say that the capacity

       3   is definitely higher on the washing, not so

       4   much on the drying.

       5        Q    All right.  And how much higher is

       6   it today?

       7        A    The capacity, well, we have two 450,

       8   we had one 75, so it looks like it would be --

       9   let me just add this up.  So it looks like the

      10   washing is about 15% higher than what it is

      11   before.  The drying would be fairly similar.

      12   We had more, now we have less but bigger.  We

      13   had one linen ironer before, we have one linen

      14   ironer now.  We had two steam blowers before,

      15   we have one now.  Yeah, the presses are

      16   exactly the same for the dry cleaning stuff.

      17   The steam tunnel is exactly the same, that was

      18   the same thing.  So, you know.

      19        Q    How about like, I don't know what

      20   the right words are, but like all the towels,

      21   the tablecloths, and things like that that

      22   come back through, do they all get pressed as

      23   well?

      24        A    Yes -- well, not the towels don't


                                                       102




       1   get pressed.

       2        Q    I'm sorry, that's true.  But like

       3   all the tablecloths and napkins, how were

       4   those pressed in the old building?

       5        A    Same, like the ironer you see there.

       6        Q    And so is the capacity of the

       7   ironing for those things the same?

       8        A    Yeah.  So the ironer is the same,

       9   it's what they called a 232.  I believe this

      10   one is a little wider, but just for the longer

      11   tablecloths, but yeah.

      12        Q    And you had mentioned earlier today,

      13   I think you called it the clothing sorter?

      14        A    Uh-huh.

      15        Q    So it sounded to me like in the old

      16   building there was like hand sorting; is that

      17   correct?

      18        A    There's still hand sorting, okay,

      19   it's not computerized or anything like that.

      20   But the way, what it is is, it's two systems

      21   back to back so that it's just much easier to

      22   process, takes up more space, but it's easier

      23   to process.

      24        Q    So in the old building like


                                                       103




       1   basically things came down the conveyer and

       2   there was some person or persons there who

       3   were doing all that sorting; correct?

       4        A    Correct.

       5        Q    So what is different with the system

       6   today that makes it operate better?

       7        A    So we used to have to wash in

       8   smaller groups, so we'd have to keep like the

       9   accounts, you know, like three or four

      10   accounts together.  And then when they come

      11   through, then we would sort them out.

      12             So now we can run a larger batch

      13   together because we have two sorts, we have

      14   what we call a presort and then that that

      15   divides it up by account.  And then we have a

      16   post sort or man sort, and that divides it up

      17   by the man.

      18        Q    The man being the employee at a

      19   place?

      20        A    Yes.

      21        Q    Okay.  And so at the end of the day

      22   when the driver comes in, he's picking up his

      23   clean uniforms, that is all presorted by

      24   client and by person for him when he does that


                                                       104




       1   pickup?

       2        A    Correct.

       3        Q    All right.  And so if we went back

       4   to the day before the fire at the facility,

       5   how many employees worked inside the plant?

       6        A    Oh, I would have to get that number

       7   off, we had the payroll number.

       8        Q    Okay.  And how many employees work

       9   in the plant today?

      10        A    I would say probably about the same.

      11        Q    Okay.  And the business of Clemens

      12   Cleaning Village, how does it compare today in

      13   2019 as compared to, let's say, 2015, the year

      14   before the fire?

      15        A    So I believe -- and I would have to

      16   get the records specifically for you -- we did

      17   lose a little business after the fire.  But I

      18   believe that we're up around, you know,

      19   probably 10% from, I don't know how many years

      20   ago that was.

      21        Q    So about three years ago now.

      22        A    Yeah.

      23        Q    When you say up 10%, is that 10% --

      24        A    Over 2015.


                                                       105




       1        Q    10% of what, of the gross sales?

       2        A    Gross sales, yes.

       3        Q    Okay.

       4        A    So our growth rate really, you know,

       5   decreased because of the fire.

       6        Q    What do you mean by that?

       7        A    Because if you would look back over

       8   the time before that, four years before that,

       9   it would have been a higher growth rate than

      10   that.

      11        Q    Okay.

      12                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to mark

      13        this next document as Exhibit 9.

      14                       - - -

      15                  (Group of documents, Bates

      16        numbers Clemens 003215 through 003228,

      17        marked R. Clemens Exhibit 9.)

      18                       - - -

      19   BY MR. BLUM:

      20        Q    This is a document that was produced

      21   in the litigation.  I'm first just going to

      22   ask you if you can tell me if you know what it

      23   is?

      24        A    So this is, the first receipts are


                                                       106




       1   what we paid to the subcontractors.

       2        Q    Okay.  So there are a series of

       3   handwritten pages that run from page 3215

       4   through page 3217, is that what you're talking

       5   about?

       6        A    Yeah.  This -- well, the first ones

       7   are from Town Valet Cleaners, a dry cleaning

       8   place.

       9        Q    So just page 3215?

      10        A    The first three.

      11        Q    Okay.  So tell me what they were

      12   doing for you?

      13        A    So Town Valet was doing all like the

      14   shirts and pants, the dry cleaning stuff that

      15   I was telling you about.

      16        Q    Okay.  And is this your handwriting

      17   or someone else's handwriting?

      18        A    That's theirs.

      19        Q    Okay.  So is this their basically

      20   invoice to you for the cleaning they did for

      21   you in that period?

      22        A    That's correct.

      23        Q    Okay.  So is it accurate that they

      24   did those services from 8/7 through it looks


                                                       107




       1   8/25?

       2        A    Yeah.  So, I mean, you realize that

       3   they did all throughout the year, but those

       4   weren't provided to you because Nationwide

       5   paid for those.

       6        Q    Okay.  So --

       7        A    The question was -- so, in other

       8   words, you're asking, these were things that

       9   were done after the business interruption

      10   insurance ran out.

      11        Q    Okay, all right.  So is it accurate,

      12   then, that this receipt where it says 8/7 is

      13   not for 8/7/16, it's for 8/7/17?

      14        A    Correct.

      15        Q    Okay.  And so that company had other

      16   invoices that were paid under the business

      17   interruption claim?

      18        A    Correct.

      19        Q    Okay.  So then if we go to page

      20   3218, can you tell me what that is?

      21        A    That is K Cleaners, and it's a

      22   subcontractor.

      23        Q    Okay.  And is this from your

      24   QuickBooks at Clemens Cleaning Village?


                                                       108




       1        A    Correct.

       2        Q    All right.  And am I accurate that

       3   then this is payments from Clemens Cleaning

       4   Village to K Cleaners after the business

       5   interruption insurance was done?

       6        A    Correct.

       7        Q    Okay.  And what was K Cleaners doing

       8   for you?

       9        A    They were doing some of the greasy

      10   dry cleaning things that weren't coming clean

      11   at the subcontractors.

      12        Q    Okay.  And is it accurate that they

      13   provided those services up until 8/25 of '17?

      14        A    Yeah.

      15        Q    Okay.  And after that what did you

      16   do to get that work done?

      17        A    So that we occasionally still use

      18   them now.

      19        Q    Okay.  So when was the new building

      20   open and operating?

      21        A    Totally or just so that we could

      22   do -- so, in other words, it opened in phases.

      23        Q    Okay.

      24        A    Like the first phase we were able to


                                                       109




       1   stop was the uniforms.  We were able to wash

       2   the uniforms, process the uniforms.  What we

       3   would do is we would wash the uniforms and we

       4   would put them through the steam tunnel and

       5   then we would transport them to the back

       6   building and sort them out there.

       7        Q    Okay.  So when did that first become

       8   available to you?

       9        A    So that would be approximately the

      10   first week, so if you see Acme's invoices

      11   stop --

      12        Q    What page are you looking at?

      13        A    3223.

      14        Q    Okay.

      15        A    So that was the first subcontractor

      16   that we were able to -- or that's when we

      17   stopped Acme uniforms, I shouldn't say first,

      18   I should say that's when we stopped Acme.

      19        Q    So you stopped then on or about 8/7

      20   of 2017?

      21        A    Right.

      22        Q    Okay.  So I take it that the

      23   building was at least partially operational by

      24   like the first week of August of '17?


                                                       110




       1        A    Very limited.

       2        Q    Okay.  But at least there was

       3   something in the building?

       4        A    Uh-huh, yes.

       5        Q    So tell me then in phases how you

       6   got from, okay, we got this one piece here in

       7   August until 100% of the building was up and

       8   operating?

       9        A    Okay.  So the next thing that we

      10   were able to, or at the same time was the

      11   MacIntosh Linen, they were doing all our

      12   towels --

      13        Q    Okay.

      14        A    -- and aprons.  So we were able to

      15   stop that.

      16        Q    And can you tell me what page you're

      17   looking at right now?

      18        A    3220.

      19        Q    And it looks like the last payment

      20   to them is like August 3rd?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Okay.

      23        A    Gemini on 3222, the linen ironer was

      24   the -- that didn't get set up until two weeks


                                                       111




       1   later, so 8/15 they were doing work yet for

       2   us.

       3        Q    All right.

       4        A    So we discussed 3219, so going back

       5   to 3220, Absorbtech did roll towels for us,

       6   it's a minimal thing, and Kleentech washed the

       7   other towels.  So that was -- those were the

       8   last ones.

       9        Q    All right.  So then by Absorbtech it

      10   looks like the last payment is 8/22.

      11        A    Uh-huh.

      12        Q    And then Kleentech is 8/31; is that

      13   correct?

      14        A    Yeah.  And that's -- could be a

      15   delivery thing -- see, okay, so on Kleentech

      16   it was every two weeks that they came here.

      17   So we basically, the Absorbtech and the

      18   Kleentech, we did away with theirs, the same

      19   thing, but they already had the things from

      20   before, so.

      21        Q    So by the end of August, then, that

      22   portion that they were handling for you was

      23   completed?

      24        A    Correct.


                                                       112




       1        Q    Okay.

       2        A    And then the next page, 3224, that

       3   was for rental vehicles because we couldn't

       4   get our trucks purchased in time.

       5        Q    Okay.  Let's just stop for one

       6   second.  Let's just stick with the building,

       7   then we'll definitely come to that page.

       8             So is it accurate, then, that by the

       9   end of August of 2017, the operations of the

      10   actual company were all in the new building?

      11        A    No.

      12        Q    Okay.  So tell me what was not in

      13   the building on, let's say, September 1st of

      14   2017?

      15        A    So the part where they get the

      16   uniforms ready, so when we have a new customer

      17   or are assigning new garments for a new

      18   employee, those have to be labeled, they have

      19   to be hemmed, and so on and so forth like

      20   that.  So that whole operation was still down

      21   in the other building at the time.

      22        Q    Your building?

      23        A    Yes, correct.

      24        Q    And by your employees doing the


                                                       113




       1   work?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  And when did that make it

       4   over to the new building?

       5        A    December.

       6        Q    Okay.  So is it accurate, then, that

       7   all the operations were in this building other

       8   than that last piece?

       9        A    No.  The office wasn't.

      10        Q    Okay.  But I mean, let's talk

      11   about -- I'm talking about like people really

      12   doing the work, of the cleaning and pressing

      13   and everything?

      14        A    Okay.  So the sorting thing that you

      15   were asking about, all right, that wasn't

      16   installed until November.  So what we would do

      17   for the uniforms is we would take them from

      18   here into the back building, they would be

      19   sorted out, and then they would come up

      20   from -- they would come up -- actually, I

      21   guess they would stay down there and the

      22   drivers would pick them up there.

      23        Q    So is it accurate that there were no

      24   subcontractors paid for extra work by the end


                                                       114




       1   of August of '17?

       2        A    I believe that's correct.

       3        Q    All right.  So then you were going

       4   to also, you were looking at page, I think,

       5   3224?

       6        A    So 3224 is the amount that we paid

       7   to Bergey's for renting vehicles that we

       8   couldn't get the replacement trucks fast

       9   enough.

      10        Q    Okay.  And were all of those

      11   vehicles on leases from Bergey's, the vehicles

      12   that were lost?

      13        A    No.

      14        Q    Do you know how many of them were on

      15   leases from Bergey's versus how many you

      16   owned?

      17        A    No, I do not.  I can get that for

      18   you, but I don't have that.

      19        Q    And on the vehicles that were leased

      20   from Bergey's, what arrangement did they make

      21   for you for I'll call it the termination of

      22   the lease, what did they do about that?

      23        A    That was a bad situation because

      24   they -- we had to keep on paying Bergey's for


                                                       115




       1   the lease of the vehicle because Bergey's and

       2   Nationwide were going back and forth.  And so

       3   we had to wait that out till we could get a

       4   replacement for that vehicle.

       5        Q    And how long did it take for

       6   Bergey's and Nationwide to resolve all those

       7   issues?

       8        A    A few months.  But that was just for

       9   the vehicle that caused the fire.

      10        Q    Okay.  So then was that the only

      11   vehicle that was leased?

      12        A    That had to be replaced, I am not

      13   sure about that.  I don't know.

      14        Q    So were there lease payments that no

      15   longer had to be made as a result of vehicles

      16   being lost?

      17        A    I don't know.  I don't believe so.

      18   Janet would know that.

      19        Q    Then if we go to the next page,

      20   which would be 3225?

      21        A    Okay.  That was our transportation

      22   truck that we had to -- we had a truck rented

      23   from DelVal International, and it was a larger

      24   truck.  And that would make the route so it


                                                       116




       1   would go to Gemini, it would go to MacIntosh,

       2   it would go to Acme, take the dirty stuff

       3   there, pick up the clean stuff.

       4        Q    So that is the transportation cost

       5   from the existing facility to the

       6   subcontractors?

       7        A    Uh-huh.

       8        Q    Okay.  And how long was that truck

       9   in place?

      10        A    I believe that would have been, I

      11   think we kept that the whole month of August

      12   because to wait until everything was done.  I

      13   don't know.  I would have to check here.

      14        Q    Okay.  And did the insurance company

      15   reimburse you for that expense up until June

      16   of 2017?

      17        A    Yes.

      18        Q    All right.  If you take a look at

      19   page 3226, what are those expenses, if you

      20   know?

      21        A    I believe -- I'll go back here -- so

      22   I believe that is the exact -- so that's

      23   related to 3225, you see 3225 doesn't have any

      24   amounts on it.


                                                       117




       1        Q    Right.

       2        A    So that is just what we discussed

       3   there.

       4        Q    Okay.

       5        A    So the tolls and then the rental of

       6   that vehicle.

       7        Q    Okay.  Let's take a look at page

       8   3227 through 3228, if we could.  Do you have

       9   an understanding of what this document is?

      10        A    Yes.

      11        Q    And what is your understanding?

      12        A    So my understanding is that the

      13   invoices that we have listed on the first ten

      14   pages of this document that you gave, that is

      15   the backup for that.  So, in other words,

      16   K Cleaners is on there, Town Valet, MacIntosh,

      17   Gemini, Absorbtech.  And those numbers add up

      18   to 230,399, which is what the papers in the

      19   front should back that up.

      20             And then the next page was what we

      21   had talked about, the last item, the truck

      22   leases to the end of August.  So the total

      23   subcontract expense, 239, that's what I

      24   believe this is.


                                                       118




       1        Q    Okay.  And isn't it also true,

       2   though, that from those, like you didn't have

       3   to perform those services, your company, in

       4   other words, so you didn't have during this

       5   time frame expenses for all of the laundry

       6   detergent and everything else that would have

       7   gone into producing the same work that the

       8   subcontractor did for you?

       9        A    That would be correct.  But then we

      10   also have the added transportation and sorting

      11   and everything expense, too.

      12        Q    Okay.  And have you done anything,

      13   though, to account for the amounts that were

      14   in fact saved?

      15        A    We haven't looked at it either way,

      16   what more cost us to have it and what loss it

      17   cost us.

      18        Q    Then if you look down, continuing

      19   down on that page, it says "Replacement Cost,"

      20   okay, and in the total replacement cost it's

      21   listed as $674,928.  Do you see that?

      22        A    Uh-huh.

      23        Q    And then it says, underneath it,

      24   "Insurance valuation," so is it accurate that


                                                       119




       1   the only amount being claimed by Clemens is

       2   the difference between those two, the 218?

       3        A    I don't want to say that.  I don't

       4   know, again, I'm not going to put that -- I

       5   don't have the copies of the receipts or what

       6   you're exactly asking here for.

       7        Q    Okay.  So let me ask you this:  Did

       8   you prepare this document?

       9        A    No.

      10        Q    Who did prepare it?

      11        A    Janet.

      12        Q    So Janet would be definitely the

      13   person to ask about that?

      14        A    Uh-huh.

      15                  MR. BLUM:  I don't have

      16        anything further on that document.

      17                  We'll mark this as 10, if we

      18        could.

       1        Q    Randy, have you seen this document

       2   before, which we marked as Exhibit No. 10?

       3        A    I haven't seen it as a whole.  This

       4   looks like the monthly statement that we used

       5   to receive from Nationwide.  But I don't ... I

       6   never saw it as a whole like this.

       7        Q    According to this report, the

       8   company did not actually sustain from the day

       9   of the loss, June 15th through June 15th of

      10   2017, the company did not sustain any loss of

      11   income and in fact had a higher income.  Do

      12   you agree with that?

      13        A    Absolutely not.

      14        Q    Okay.  And tell me what the basis --

      15   again I use the word income, gross income,

      16   coming into the company, okay?  Tell me the

      17   basis for your dispute of that?

      18        A    Because they're counting the monies

      19   that we -- that they were giving us as

      20   revenue, I believe.

      21        Q    Okay.  Go ahead.

      22        A    So our profits were, they're

      23   counting that as profit but we didn't have

      24   any -- we were making very good money


                                                       121




       1   beforehand, and we didn't take any money out

       2   of the business at all, no bonuses, nothing.

       3        Q    Okay.

       4        A    So --

       5        Q    Again, it was not a question of lost

       6   profits, okay.  The question was, was there a

       7   change in the gross income of the company?

       8        A    I don't -- I don't know -- that's an

       9   accounting thing.

      10        Q    Have you done anything to dispute

      11   with the insurance company its analysis?

      12        A    There were different things that we

      13   did, yes.

      14        Q    And what did you dispute?

      15        A    There was one of the things on the,

      16   if you notice on the statement that you had

      17   asked about, there was a $10,000 payment made

      18   for, that was originally on the invoice for

      19   accounting, and that $10,000 was then paid out

      20   of some kind of a line item that they had.

      21        Q    Okay.  So you made a claim to them

      22   for extra accounting expenses that the company

      23   had, they did not pay it, and eventually they

      24   paid you $10,000?


                                                       122




       1        A    That's correct.

       2        Q    Okay.  Anything else that you

       3   remember being disputed?

       4        A    I don't know if it was a dispute.

       5   They had -- there was equipment that we had

       6   purchased and then resold at the end that we

       7   couldn't recover the money for.  And it was

       8   used just for our temporary use.  And so then

       9   they did come through and pay some of that.

      10        Q    Okay.  And is there some amount of

      11   that, I'll call that difference that you're

      12   claiming?

      13        A    That's not listed on your -- this

      14   happened before the amount was made on there,

      15   so it's not -- it has nothing to do with the

      16   monies that we have listed here.

      17        Q    Okay.

      18        A    The only thing that is on there is

      19   that $10,000, that's a post thing.

      20        Q    Okay.  And if we go back to that

      21   Interrogatory answer, I don't think there's

      22   anything in there for a loss that you incurred

      23   from equipment that you purchased and resold.

      24   Are you claiming some loss in this lawsuit


                                                       123




       1   about that?

       2        A    No.

       3        Q    All right.  If you could take the

       4   document we put in front of you and look at

       5   page 1741, if you could.  So this, if you

       6   begin on this page and go through the end of

       7   the report, there are a list of invoices that,

       8   according to this report, your company

       9   submitted to the insurance company and they

      10   paid.

      11        A    Uh-huh.  Yes.

      12        Q    Were you on like a monthly basis

      13   submitting those invoices to them?

      14        A    We tried to be, yes.

      15        Q    Okay.  And were they all paid?

      16        A    As far as I know, these invoices

      17   were all paid.

      18        Q    Okay.  And I believe their total

      19   that they show as having been paid, if you

      20   look on page 1758, is $1,976,815.39.  Do you

      21   have any dispute of that number?

      22        A    I don't have a dispute with that

      23   number.  But I don't -- couldn't tell you off

      24   the top of my head if that number is exactly


                                                       124




       1   correct to the dollar.

       2        Q    Okay.  There was also, I believe,

       3   under the business interruption insurance the

       4   first day of the loss was not covered; is that

       5   correct?

       6        A    Correct.

       7        Q    All right.  So do you know on a

       8   day-to-day basis in 2016 what the operating

       9   income of the company was, the gross income

      10   that came in?

      11        A    Depending on what day it was, like

      12   Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday were higher,

      13   that could be 16 to 18 thousand.  Monday and

      14   Fridays, that could be like more like 12 to 14

      15   thousand.

      16        Q    All right.  And that was the gross

      17   number that would have been, let's say, billed

      18   for the day?

      19        A    Uh-huh.

      20        Q    You have to say yes or no.

      21        A    Yes.  Sorry.

      22        Q    I want to switch now, if we could go

      23   back to that Interrogatory answer.

      24                  MR. BLUM:  Why don't we take a

       2                  MR. SLATTERY:  Sure.

       6   BY MR. BLUM:

       7        Q    Referring back to Interrogatory

       8   No. 84, the second paragraph deals with the

       9   loss by the Family Limited Partnership.

      10        A    Correct.

      11        Q    All right.  So can you tell me what

      12   is the claim of the Family Limited Partnership

      13   above and beyond the insurance payment they

      14   got on the building?

      15        A    So it would be these two, am I

      16   reading that?

      17                  MR. SLATTERY:  Yes.

      18                  THE WITNESS:  So just the doing

      19        a quick addition, maybe $546,000.

      20   BY MR. BLUM:

      21        Q    Okay.  And tell me what are the

      22   components of that, what are the numbers that

      23   you're putting together there?

      24        A    The 74,000 of that is for the lost

       3   have that information as far as exactly when

       4   it would be till December when we got the

       5   occupancy permit.

       6        Q    And is that for the tenant, is that

       7   for S-Bond?

       8        A    That was for -- that was for the

       9   amount of -- the amount for the total, I guess

      10   it was 11,700 plus the 1,800.

      11        Q    So it's the loss of rent from both

      12   the tenants that were in the building?

      13        A    I believe that's how that number was

      14   arrived at, but I would have to double-check

      15   that.

      16        Q    Okay.  And then other than the loss

      17   of rent, what is the other expense that's

      18   being claimed?

      19        A    The expense for rebuilding the

      20   building of things that we weren't reimbursed

      21   for.  So we had to put all new sidewalks in,

      22   new storm sewers.  We had to put new -- what

      23   do you call it -- manhole covers -- I mean

      24   manhole.  We had to put new electric service.


                                                       127




       1   We had to repave.  Just, you know, things that

       2   were above what Millers paid.

       3        Q    Okay.  After the fire occurred, was

       4   there an opportunity for the company to

       5   rebuild the old building?

       6        A    So we -- you mean as far as

       7   rebuilding the exact same thing or no?

       8        Q    I'll ask a better question.

       9             So the day after the fire there were

      10   portions of the structure which were still

      11   standing; is that correct?

      12        A    That's correct.

      13        Q    All right.  And did you have an

      14   option at that point to say, we want to

      15   salvage pieces of the existing structure

      16   rather than knock it all down?

      17        A    No.

      18        Q    Okay.  Why not?

      19        A    Because we weren't allowed to get --

      20   nobody was allowed near the building because

      21   it was -- first of all, they had the

      22   investigation going on.  And then, secondly,

      23   the fire, I believe it was the fire chief or

      24   fire marshal said the building was unsafe, so.


                                                       128




       1        Q    And was that the entire building or

       2   just sections of the building?

       3        A    He said the building is unsafe.  He

       4   didn't really say anything.  I mean, visually

       5   you could see that they tore the front of the

       6   building off during the fire, so you knew that

       7   was unsafe.  And then there was other places

       8   where there was cracks in the masonry because

       9   the heat was so high.

      10        Q    So was there ever any discussion

      11   that you had with an engineer about whether or

      12   not you could save any of the building?

      13        A    No.  We were waiting for Millers.

      14        Q    All right.  And did Millers tell you

      15   that the building couldn't be saved?

      16        A    Millers told us that they had an

      17   engineer in and they said that it's not worth

      18   saving.

      19        Q    Okay.  And did you at the time of

      20   the fire have a personal opinion of what the

      21   value of the building was before the fire?

      22        A    Well, I mean, normally you figure on

      23   something like this, they figure around $100 a

      24   square foot.


                                                       129




       1        Q    And how many square feet was the

       2   original building?

       3        A    27,500.

       4        Q    All right.  And what in total were

       5   you paid by the insurance company on the

       6   building loss, if you know?

       7        A    Millers would have that information.

       8        Q    Okay.  And the extra expenses that

       9   you had, were they rejected by the insurance

      10   company or they were above the limit?

      11        A    So some of the things, like I said,

      12   like when they brought the fire -- when they

      13   brought the backhoe or track hoe in here to

      14   tear out the front of the building, the fire

      15   marshal made them do that.  So it ruined the

      16   sidewalk, ruined the curbing, you know,

      17   because they brought that across there and

      18   everything like that.  So that in the policy

      19   it says, no paving, no, whatever, you know, no

      20   sidewalks, no curbing or anything like that,

      21   won't pay for that.  And then they had -- we

      22   had to put, bury the wastewater -- not

      23   wastewater, rainwater all into the storm

      24   sewers, not storm sewers, through the


                                                       130




       1   retention basin, which wasn't before.  So then

       2   that all had to be dug up and that had to be

       3   paved over, and they wouldn't pay for any of

       4   that.  And then we had to pay to rip the trees

       5   out, then we had the pay to put the trees back

       6   in.

       7        Q    And those receipts for all that

       8   work, have they been submitted to your

       9   attorney?

      10        A    Yes, yes.

      11        Q    Okay.  As we sit here today, are

      12   there any other losses that you're claiming

      13   other than what we've already discussed?

      14        A    Hair.

      15        Q    Say that again?

      16        A    Hair.

      17        Q    I don't think that counts, I don't

      18   think changes in the color of your hair

      19   counts, either.

      20        A    I don't know of any.  I mean, we

      21   made a claim, I don't think that is any

      22   other --

      23                  MR. BLUM:  If you want to take

      24        a break for a minute.


                                                       131




       1                  MR. SLATTERY:  I mean, I

       2        think --

       3                  THE WITNESS:  I mean --

       4                  MR. SLATTERY:  I think the

       5        claim is reflected in the Interrogatory

       6        that we've discussed.  You didn't touch

       7        on the deductibles for the truck, I mean,

       8        maybe there were some other things.

       9                  MR. BLUM:  Okay.

      10   BY MR. BLUM:

      11        Q    So other than what we've discussed

      12   and what appears in the Answer to

      13   Interrogatory No. 84, is there any other

      14   losses that you can think of that should be

      15   included in the claim?

      16        A    I believe you're correct.

      17        Q    Okay.  So after the fire occurred,

      18   when was the first time that anyone ever told

      19   you they thought the fire started in the

      20   Mercedes Sprinter?

      21        A    So the night of the fire, when they

      22   took me around to the different places, like

      23   they wanted to see what was chemicals, what

      24   was things.  They wanted to know what was


                                                       132




       1   where the Sprinter was parked.  And I said it

       2   was the Sprinter and that's, I said that's it.

       3   And they said because that area is exactly

       4   where the fire started.

       5        Q    Right.  And who is it that said

       6   that?

       7        A    I believe it was a member of the

       8   fire staff.

       9        Q    Was it Mr. Daveler?

      10        A    There were several people, there

      11   were several people there, so I don't know --

      12   Mr. Daveler was one of the people there, but I

      13   do not believe he said it.  I think it was one

      14   of the people that was there, that went in the

      15   fire.

      16        Q    Okay.  And then after that, other

      17   than things that you have been told by your

      18   attorney, who if anyone ever told you that the

      19   fire started in the Sprinter?

      20        A    Oh, there was a guy from Stutman law

      21   firm, I don't know if that was -- if it was an

      22   attorney or if it was an investigator.

      23        Q    Okay.  And was that within days

      24   after the fire?


                                                       133




       1        A    That was like real, like right away,

       2   because that was why we couldn't move

       3   anything.  And then I believe Mercedes like

       4   flew a couple people in, and there was like 20

       5   people here the one day.  And we had to pay to

       6   have security here to keep the thing secure.

       7        Q    And has anyone ever told you that

       8   the fire started anyplace else other than in

       9   that Mercedes?

      10        A    No, no.

      11                  MR. BLUM:  I have no further

      12        questions.

      13                       - - -

      14                    EXAMINATION

      15                       - - -

      16   BY MR. DIVIS:

      17        Q    Sir, I've got a few questions for

      18   you.  I don't anticipate being all that long.

      19   But I represent Bergey's, my name is Dan

      20   Divis.  We have probably been introduced

      21   before.

      22             You said the first person who told

      23   you that they believe the fire started in the

      24   Mercedes, I think you said someone who went


                                                       134




       1   into the fire.

       2        A    I believe that it was one of the

       3   first people on the scene of the fire.  But

       4   they told me exactly where it started, they

       5   didn't tell me it started.

       6        Q    They told you exactly where it

       7   started meaning --

       8        A    Location.

       9        Q    Okay.  And you said that was one of

      10   the first people who went to the fire.  Do you

      11   mean one of the firefighters?

      12        A    Yeah, uh-huh.

      13        Q    The next person you talked to about

      14   where the fire started was who?

      15        A    There was three people, there was

      16   like three people there, I believe it was the

      17   fire chief and I believe it was another

      18   firefighter.  I don't believe Jay Daveler was

      19   there at that point yet.

      20        Q    And when they told you this, did

      21   they point to an area where they believe the

      22   fire started as opposed to saying it was the

      23   Mercedes?

      24        A    At that point they did not say that,


                                                       135




       1   I don't believe that.  They just wanted to

       2   know what was there.  And I said just the

       3   Mercedes.

       4        Q    Just to make sure I'm clear, they

       5   were telling you that area where the Mercedes

       6   was, was where the fire started.  Is that

       7   accurate?

       8        A    That area, correct.

       9        Q    I'm sorry to jump around, but that's

      10   the nature of asking questions second.

      11             The document marked R. Clemens 6 is

      12   the lease for the vehicle that you were asked

      13   about.

      14        A    Uh-huh.

      15        Q    I just want to make sure I

      16   understand.  The lease was signed -- can you

      17   go to page 2481, sir.  And that's signed by

      18   Paul Clemens?

      19        A    Uh-huh.

      20        Q    Correct?

      21        A    Yes.

      22        Q    Paul is your father?

      23        A    Yes.

      24        Q    Is he still involved in the


                                                       136




       1   business?

       2        A    Not very much, no.

       3        Q    As of 2011, he was?

       4        A    Yes.

       5        Q    And what was his role in the

       6   business?

       7        A    He was part owner.

       8        Q    And I think it says "Title" there,

       9   is that --

      10        A    He just put chairman, I think.

      11        Q    So as far as you know, that's his

      12   signature and he was signing the agreement on

      13   behalf of Clemens Cleaning Village, Inc.;

      14   correct?

      15        A    Correct.

      16        Q    And as I understand it, you never

      17   actually read that lease; is that accurate?

      18        A    No.  I'm not saying that I didn't

      19   read, you know, before we got the vehicle,

      20   they sent over the lease, okay.  But I didn't

      21   read this exact lease, but I imagine it's the

      22   same that was sent over to us.

      23        Q    I guess my question is, do you have

      24   a recollection of ever reading this lease or


                                                       137




       1   any lease that was sent to you by Bergey's

       2   before October of 2011?

       3        A    We, for sure the first several, you

       4   know, that we had we did, yes.

       5        Q    Okay.  Did you ever consult with any

       6   lawyer or have any dispute with Bergey's about

       7   what the provisions of the lease were?

       8        A    No.  They were real good friends of

       9   ours, so we trust them.

      10        Q    And do you still lease vehicles from

      11   Bergey's?

      12        A    At this point I do not believe we

      13   have any left on lease.  We purchase the

      14   vehicles from Bergey's.  In fact, all the

      15   vehicles, all the trucks that you see out

      16   there, 20-some trucks, are all purchased from

      17   Bergey's.

      18        Q    Let me ask, if you go to page 2480,

      19   Paragraph 9 of that lease, if you could, 9B

      20   says, "Exclusive remedy.  In the event of

      21   mechanical failure of a leased vehicle,

      22   Customer's exclusive remedy shall be as

      23   provided in this agreement.  Under no

      24   circumstances shall Customer be entitled to


                                                       138




       1   recover from Lessor any incidental or

       2   consequential damage, including, but not

       3   limited to, damage or loss of property or

       4   equipment, loss of profits or revenue, cost of

       5   capital, cost of purchased or replacement

       6   equipment, or damage or claims for damages of

       7   Customers."

       8             You knew that provision was in there

       9   when you leased vehicles from Bergey's; is

      10   that accurate?

      11        A    So from what I understand is, that

      12   you're saying that if I take -- if you pick up

      13   a leased vehicle and you don't put the tire on

      14   right and I go down the street and I kill

      15   somebody, that you're not responsible?

      16        Q    My question, sir, is did you read

      17   that --

      18        A    I didn't read it as you're saying.

      19        Q    Okay.  But that was part of the

      20   lease, was it not?

      21        A    Yeah.

      22        Q    Okay.  And when your father entered

      23   into this lease agreement, do you remember him

       1   Bergey's about that particular provision?

       2        A    No.

       3        Q    Did you ever talk to anybody at

       4   Bergey's about that particular provision?

       5        A    Never.

       6        Q    You said -- we were discussing, this

       7   is Exhibit 9, if you go -- let me look at

       8   mine.

       9                  MR. SLATTERY:  3224.

      10                  MR. DIVIS:  Thank you.

      11   BY MR. DIVIS:

      12        Q    I'm not entirely sure, this is part

      13   of the recap of the damages that you're

      14   claiming, and I think this is something that's

      15   in excess of what you were paid

      16   insurance-wise.  Can you tell me what is --

      17        A    So the Nationwide policy has 30 days

      18   of rental coverage.  So you can't replace as

      19   many vehicles as we have in 30 days.

      20        Q    So these were rentals from Bergey's

      21   that your business incurred following the fire

      22   that was not covered by Nationwide; is that

      23   accurate?

      24        A    Repeat that one more time.


                                                       140




       1        Q    Sure.  The expenses incurred here,

       2   the $40,000, is rental expense to the business

       3   that you incurred because of rentals that you

       4   got from Bergey's that was not otherwise

       5   covered by Nationwide; is that accurate?

       6        A    That's correct.

       7        Q    Okay.  And you said there was a

       8   dispute between Nationwide and Bergey's about

       9   some particular issue, and I wasn't sure what

      10   that was.

      11        A    The title.

      12        Q    And you're talking specifically

      13   about the Sprinter which --

      14        A    Caused the fire.

      15        Q    Okay.  So the dispute wasn't with

      16   respect to the items identified in 3224,

      17   you're talking specifically about the Sprinter

      18   at issue in this case; correct?

      19        A    Yeah.  You said if there was any

      20   other -- I'm sorry, you didn't.  He asked if

      21   there was any other disputes of things, and I

      22   mentioned that one was the counting thing, and

      23   that was paid later and that was marked there.

      24   There was something that happened at the very


                                                       141




       1   beginning, okay?  The dispute was that we had

       2   to keep on paying Bergey's for a leased

       3   vehicle that was burned up and out of here,

       4   okay.  And it was because Bergey's wouldn't

       5   release the title to Nationwide, so that's

       6   what the whole thing was.

       7        Q    Okay.

       8        A    And then, so then Bergey's continues

       9   to charge for the rental, so that's probably

      10   why it is, because they knew that they were

      11   going to get more money.

      12        Q    Well, did Bergey's ultimately

      13   provide a replacement for the leased vehicle

      14   that was involved in the fire?

      15        A    No.

      16        Q    Okay.  Did you have any discussions

      17   with anybody at Bergey's about the fire or the

      18   cause of the fire?

      19        A    No.  We needed to have the copy of

      20   the lease so that we could get paid for it.

      21        Q    Okay.  But at some point did you

      22   ever -- just so I'm clear, you never had any

      23   discussions with anybody at Bergey's about the

      24   cause of the fire or the Sprinter being the


                                                       142




       1   cause of the fire; is that correct?

       2        A    I called over there to get the

       3   records for the vehicle and they said that

       4   they wouldn't release them to me.

       5        Q    Any other discussions you had with

       6   Bergey's about the Sprinter that's at issue in

       7   this case? -- let me say after the fire?

       8        A    I don't believe so.

       9        Q    Sorry for the delay, just going

      10   through my notes, I don't want to reinvent the

      11   wheel with you.

      12        A    That's fine.  I get paid by the

      13   hour.

      14        Q    You were asked by Mr. Blum earlier

      15   questions about whether or not a fire alarm

      16   had been installed or whether or not a fire

      17   alarm had been considered.  Would your answers

      18   be the same to the question as to whether or

      19   not a smoke alarm had been considered and/or

      20   installed in the building?

      21        A    Yes, the answer would be the same.

      22        Q    Before this facility was opened,

      23   where was the Clemens Cleaning dry cleaning

      24   business?


                                                       143




       1        A    614 East Main Street, one of the

       2   locations.

       3        Q    And how many locations did you have

       4   before --

       5        A    I'm sorry, that was the only

       6   location under that corporate name.

       7        Q    I'm sorry, the only --

       8        A    Corporation, the only location under

       9   that corporate name.

      10        Q    And were there any other addresses

      11   where Clemens conducted business other than

      12   that location before this building was opened?

      13        A    Oh, multiple locations.

      14        Q    All over?

      15        A    Well, in the general area.

      16        Q    How many locations did you have?

      17        A    Oh, throughout the years, who knows,

      18   we might have had ten.

      19        Q    And ultimately those locations were

      20   closed at some point?

      21        A    Sold.

      22        Q    And in 2016, June 2016, how many

      23   employees, approximately, did you have come in

      24   here on a daily basis?


                                                       144




       1        A    Counting the drivers?

       2        Q    Yes, sir.

       3        A    I would say somewhere in the mid

       4   40s, 45, 48, something like that, off the top

       5   of my head.  We have the records of that.

       6        Q    Sure.  To the extent you can

       7   estimate, that's fine.  I'm not going to

       8   nitpick and hold you to the specific number.

       9   But approximately 40 to 48 employees that you

      10   had back in 2016?

      11        A    Yes, probably 45 to 48.

      12        Q    And what do you have now in terms of

      13   employees here on a daily basis?

      14        A    Right over 50, 52, 54, something

      15   like that.

      16        Q    And how many vehicles -- do you own

      17   all your vehicles now?

      18        A    I believe so.  I think the last one

      19   came off the lease, but if you need that I can

      20   get that for you, but I don't know.

      21        Q    The number of vehicles that your

      22   business now has that you own to operate the

      23   business is how many?

      24        A    My guess is 20.

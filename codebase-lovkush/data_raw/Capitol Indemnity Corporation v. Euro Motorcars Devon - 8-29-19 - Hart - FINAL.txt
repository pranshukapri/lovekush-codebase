      14   BY MR. BLUM:

      15        Q    State your full name for the record?

      16        A    Alex Hart.

      17        Q    Alex, by whom are you employed?

      18        A    Millers Mutual.

      19        Q    Alex, my name is Joseph Blum and I

      20   represent Mercedes in a case that's been

      21   brought by your company against them in

      22   reference to a loss at the Clemens facility

      23   here in Lansdale.

      24             I'm going to ask you a series of


                                                         6




       1   questions today.  Any time you don't

       2   understand my question, please let me know,

       3   I'll be happy to restate it for you.  I'd ask

       4   you keep all your responses verbal because the

       5   court reporter cannot take down a nod of the

       6   head or shrug of the shoulders.  Okay?

       7        A    Yep.

       8        Q    If at any time today you want a

       9   break or anything like that, please let me

      10   know.  The other thing that I would ask you to

      11   do, if you could, is to let me finish my

      12   question before you start to speak because,

      13   again, the court reporter has to take

      14   everything down.  All right?

      15        A    Okay.

      16        Q    Alex, how long have you worked for

      17   Millers?

      18        A    About four years.

      19        Q    In what capacity are you employed

      20   there?

      21        A    I'm a property claim adjuster.

      22        Q    And has that been consistent through

      23   the whole four years you have been there?

      24        A    Yes, it has.


                                                         7




       1        Q    Are there any particular type of

       2   property claims that you handle?

       3        A    I mean, anything under -- basically

       4   anything that we write under commercial

       5   property, or, you know, business owner's

       6   policy, builder's risk, subro marine,

       7   basically anything that we write.

       8        Q    So it's basically commercial

       9   property versus residential?

      10        A    Correct.

      11        Q    Okay.  And could you tell us

      12   basically what your educational background is?

      13        A    I've a Bachelor's degree from

      14   University of Pittsburgh, and that's the

      15   highest level.

      16        Q    Okay.  And when did you graduate

      17   from University of Pittsburgh?

      18        A    In 2010.

      19        Q    I won't hold that against you, by

      20   the way, that you went to school there.

      21             And what is your degree in from

      22   University of Pittsburgh?

      23        A    It was social sciences.

      24        Q    And after you left University of


                                                         8




       1   Pittsburgh, can you tell us what your

       2   employment history was up until the time you

       3   went to Millers?

       4        A    Yeah.  After college I worked for a

       5   trucking company doing operations management

       6   and managing drivers and logistics and things

       7   like that.

       8        Q    How long did you work there?

       9        A    I guess almost five or six years,

      10   something like that.

      11        Q    Is that the only other job you

      12   had --

      13        A    Right.

      14        Q    -- other than Millers?

      15        A    Correct.

      16        Q    So when you got to Millers, did they

      17   provide you with any type of training about

      18   how to be a property adjuster?

      19        A    Yeah.  I mean, we did, you know,

      20   seminars, training classes or seminars or

      21   something through The Institutes, which is

      22   like how you get accreditations and things

      23   like that.

      24        Q    And have you received any kind of


                                                         9




       1   certificates or anything --

       2        A    I haven't completed the AIC yet, but

       3   I have completed some of that, so.

       4        Q    Okay.  What, if anything, did you do

       5   to prepare for your deposition today other

       6   than speak to your attorney?

       7        A    I reviewed some items in the file

       8   and the file notes and some pictures of the

       9   damage and things like that.

      10        Q    All right.  And what was in the file

      11   other than the file notes that you looked at?

      12        A    Various reports from our independent

      13   adjuster, a lot of invoices and -- I'm trying

      14   to think what else -- photographs, engineer

      15   reports.  I don't know, there's a lot in

      16   there.

      17        Q    Okay.  And when was the first time

      18   that you had anything to do with this loss at

      19   the Clemens facility?

      20        A    It was assigned to me originally, so

      21   basically when we got the loss report, which I

      22   think was the day after the fire, it was in my

      23   name, and it was in my name the whole time, I

      24   think, so.

       1        Q    And who was the insured that Millers

       2   had on that property?

       3        A    I believe it was P.R. Clemens

       4   Family, LP.

       5        Q    And is it your understanding that

       6   your insured owned the physical plant there,

       7   the building?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    Okay.  And what was the insurance,

      10   basically what was the insurance coverage that

      11   Millers provided to P.R. Family Partnership?

      12        A    It was for building coverage and

      13   with that business income, which was rental

      14   income from I think Clemens Uniform or Clemens

      15   Cleaning, something like that.  So the

      16   businesses that ran in the building.  But our

      17   coverage applied to the building.

      18        Q    Okay.  And after this loss was

      19   received or you got notice of it, did you

      20   personally go there to the scene?

      21        A    Yes.  I think it was within -- I

      22   think it was the day after we received the

      23   report of the claim, so within 48 hours of the

      24   loss.

       1        Q    And what was the purpose of going

       2   there?

       3        A    Just overall site inspection and

       4   kind of, I don't know, scope it out, I guess,

       5   and meeting with, I believe the fire marshal

       6   was still onsite, emergency services

       7   contractors were there, our independent

       8   adjuster, Dave Bennett, was there.  And I

       9   think there may have been a few other people,

      10   I can't remember.  But basically just to kind

      11   of get eyes on it, see the extent of the

      12   damage and what the building looked like.

      13        Q    You mentioned that there was an

      14   independent adjuster, David Bennett, who was

      15   there.  When was Mr. Bennett retained?

      16        A    Would have been the same day we

      17   received the loss.  Just knowing the size, I

      18   think there was news coverage of it, we just

      19   kind of knew with the limit and the video and

      20   what the news was reporting, it was a large

      21   loss.  And he's usually who we use for losses

      22   of that size.

      23        Q    Okay.  And what was he retained to

      24   do?


                                                        12




       1        A    To adjust the claim and basically

       2   quantify the damages.

       3        Q    And when you say adjust the claim

       4   and quantify the damages, can you be more

       5   specific in terms of what was his real

       6   assignment, what was he supposed to do?

       7        A    Sure.  Basically to write a repair

       8   estimate or determine the value of the

       9   building, if it's a full replacement or, you

      10   know, answer questions regarding the policy or

      11   apply the appropriate coverages to, you know,

      12   items they may run into that may not fall

      13   under the typical building coverage but might

      14   be added on as extensions or enhancements or

      15   things like that.  So basically to apply the

      16   coverage as it appears on the policy.

      17        Q    Okay.

      18                  MR. BLUM:  I'm going to mark

      19        this as Exhibit 1 if we could.

       2   BY MR. BLUM:

       3        Q    Alex, have you ever seen this

       4   document before?

       5        A    It's possible, but I don't recall.

       6        Q    I'm going to direct your attention,

       7   if we could, to Interrogatory No. 85, and I

       8   apologize, there's no page numbers on here.

       9        A    85, you said?

      10        Q    Yes.

      11        A    Okay.

      12        Q    And if you could, could you take a

      13   moment and review, just in your head, the

      14   question 85 and the answer that's there.

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    Have you had an opportunity to

      17   review that?

      18        A    Yes.

      19        Q    And is that an accurate answer in

      20   terms of the total amount that was paid by

      21   Millers Capital Insurance to or on behalf of

      22   the Clemens Family Partnership?

      23        A    I believe it is, yes.

      24        Q    Okay.  So there really, as you said,


                                                        14




       1   there are two things that were paid.  First

       2   there was $2,401,763.52 paid for building

       3   damage; correct?

       4        A    Correct.

       5        Q    And then there was $187,560.52 for

       6   business income?

       7        A    Correct.

       8        Q    And we'll get into it more, but that

       9   business income is actually a loss of rental

      10   income; correct?

      11        A    Correct.

      12        Q    So let's talk about the building

      13   damage, that $2.4 million.  What does that

      14   number represent?  Is it a number for the

      15   repair of the building or is that a number for

      16   what the building was worth before the fire?

      17        A    That was basically our policy limit

      18   was $2.3 million.  Then there was, I think

      19   there's an automatic 4% increase every year,

      20   so I think Dave Bennett calculated it as our

      21   limit would have been like $2.365, or

      22   something like that, so that would be for the

      23   repair or replacement of the damage up to that

      24   amount.


                                                        15




       1             And then there was various

       2   enhancements or extensions of things that are

       3   added on.  I know debris removal is one of

       4   them.  I think some landscaping we can cover,

       5   fire department charges.  Certain things are

       6   added on to increase the limit other than

       7   what's stated on the property schedule.

       8        Q    Okay.  And is it your understanding

       9   that that $2.4 million that was paid was like

      10   the max limit that was available?

      11        A    Yes, I believe it was.

      12        Q    Okay.  And was there a determination

      13   made by you or anyone acting on behalf of

      14   Millers of what the value of the building was

      15   the day before the fire?

      16        A    Yeah, I believe Dave Bennett would

      17   have done that with, I think he used a

      18   program, Marshall Swift, that you can type in

      19   the square footage of a building, the

      20   occupancy, the construction, everything.  I

      21   mean, you can lay in as many details as you

      22   know and it should give you an accurate amount

      23   of what it would cost to tear it down and

      24   rebuild it.


                                                        16




       1        Q    Okay.  That's not my question.

       2   Okay?  That's a question of, like, like you

       3   said, tearing it down and rebuilding it.  But

       4   did anyone make a determination of what was

       5   the value of that building the day before the

       6   fire?

       7        A    Yeah, I believe I did answer that

       8   Dave Bennett would have done that as part of

       9   the initial investigation that he was doing,

      10   is determine that.

      11        Q    And did you ever, did Mr. Bennett

      12   ever verbally or in writing convey to you what

      13   that number was?

      14        A    I don't remember.

      15        Q    Okay.

      16        A    He may have, but I don't recall.

      17        Q    All right.

      18                  MR. BLUM:  I'll mark this as

      19        Exhibit 2, if I could, please.

       1   BY MR. BLUM:

       2        Q    Alex, if you can take a moment and

       3   look at this document and tell me if you have

       4   ever seen it before?

       5        A    Yes, I have.

       6        Q    And who was C.N. Timbie Engineers

       7   retained by?

       8        A    He was retained by Millers to do

       9   structural evaluation of the building.

      10        Q    Okay.  And why was that done, why

      11   did Millers hire him to do that?

      12        A    I believe the borough or the fire

      13   marshal wanted to tear the building down.  And

      14   we, I know we knew many people would want to

      15   be in there and looking around and, you know,

      16   determining their own cause and origin

      17   investigation.  And also to determine if the

      18   building needed to be torn down, as they said.

      19        Q    All right.  And what was your

      20   understanding of what Mr. Timbie's

      21   recommendations were in terms of whether or

      22   not the building needed to be torn down?

      23        A    I believe he said part of it could

      24   remain, which would have been, I don't


                                                        18




       1   remember the direction, but basically the far

       2   end of the building away from where the fire

       3   started, I think he said it could remain.

       4        Q    And who made the decision, if you

       5   know or if you have been told, who made the

       6   decision that the building would be torn down

       7   in its entirety?

       8        A    I believe the insured made that

       9   decision, but I don't know for sure.

      10        Q    And when the insured made that

      11   decision, did that impact in any way the value

      12   of what Millers was willing to pay in terms of

      13   like the rebuilding or restoring the property?

      14                  MR. SLATTERY:  Object to form.

      15                  You can answer.

      16                  MR. BLUM:  Actually, you know

      17        what, would you read that back?

       2   BY MR. BLUM:

       3        Q    Okay, you can go ahead and answer.

       4        A    To my recollection, Dave Bennett had

       5   already prepared his estimate for the repairs

       6   and it was in excess of our policy limit, so

       7   we had already quantified the damages and it

       8   was going to be over our limit.  So we

       9   wouldn't have been making that determination

      10   or letting it affect our, how much we were

      11   going to be paying.

      12                  MR. BLUM:  Could we mark this

      13        as Exhibit 3, please.

      20        Q    Alex, could you identify for us what

      21   Hart Exhibit 3 is?

      22        A    It looks like it's an email from

      23   Dave Bennett to Randy from Clemens Uniforms.

      24        Q    And have you ever seen this before?


                                                        20




       1        A    Well, I was copied on it, so I

       2   assume I did see it at some point.

       3        Q    And is it accurate that by July 20th

       4   of 2016 you had at least a preliminary

       5   estimate from Mr. Bennett on the cost of

       6   rebuilding the structures?

       7        A    That appears accurate, yes.

       8        Q    Okay.  And when you received the

       9   estimate which is attached, did you review it?

      10        A    Yeah, I would have reviewed the

      11   attachments, yes.

      12        Q    Okay.  If we could look at Page 1 of

      13   the estimate itself, it's numbered in the

      14   bottom right corner.

      15        A    Uh-huh.

      16        Q    When you received this, if you look

      17   on the actual estimate portion, there are five

      18   columns there, the first of which is

      19   Description.

      20        A    Yes.

      21        Q    Then there's a Unit Cost.  Did you

      22   have an understanding of what that unit cost

      23   was?

      24        A    I'm going to -- what do you mean by


                                                        21




       1   did I understand the unit cost?

       2        Q    What did you understand that to

       3   mean, what did you understand that to

       4   represent?

       5        A    Well, that would be the cost for a

       6   contractor to do that work.

       7        Q    Okay.  And then as you go across,

       8   there's three columns there, RCV, DEP, and

       9   ACV.  Can you tell me what your understanding

      10   of those were?

      11        A    So the replacement cost value, and

      12   the RCV would have been the total amount based

      13   on square footage.  And the unit cost

      14   depreciation is DEP, and that's the, basically

      15   due to the age and condition of the

      16   descriptive item, you know, basically how it

      17   is, loses value or its life expectancy at the

      18   time.  And then you subtract that off of the

      19   RCV number to arrive at the ACV number, which

      20   is the actual cash value.

      21        Q    And if we go all the way to the end,

      22   there is a summary at the very back page.

      23   Which of these numbers, if any, that appear

      24   there are what Millers agreed to pay?


                                                        22




       1        A    Well, at this point it would have

       2   been the ACV number, $1,998,047.70.

       3        Q    Okay.  And as we sit here today,

       4   then, can you tell us what the difference is

       5   between the 1.998 and the 2.4 million that was

       6   paid?

       7        A    Are you asking the dollar amount?

       8        Q    No.  I'm asking what it was for, and

       9   I apologize that was not clear.

      10             So, in other words, if you paid

      11   1.998 for the ACV on the building, what else

      12   did you pay that went from the 1.998 up to the

      13   2.4 million?

      14        A    I guess I'm still not understanding

      15   your question.  I mean, the ACV is issued as,

      16   you know, up front.  And then they have to

      17   provide the invoices and receipts and proof of

      18   payments for -- to show that they incurred the

      19   $2.483 million loss for us to pay additional

      20   dollars.

      21        Q    Okay, I think I understand.  So what

      22   you're saying is that if in fact the insured

      23   spent more than the 1.998 rebuilding it, you

      24   would have paid them up to the policy limit


                                                        23




       1   for the replacement?

       2        A    Correct.

       3        Q    Okay.  So if we went back to the

       4   answer to Interrogatory No. 85, the 2.4

       5   million there is an amount that was paid

       6   because the insured rebuilt the building and

       7   provided the invoices?

       8        A    Correct.

       9        Q    Okay.  And was it Mr. Bennett or you

      10   or someone else who put together the

      11   information to verify that all those funds

      12   were spent on the building?

      13        A    Yes, Mr. Bennett met with Randy from

      14   Clemens I think a few times and gathered

      15   invoices, receipts, canceled checks, and all

      16   kinds of documentation and put it together to

      17   prove that the money was incurred and spent

      18   and the building was repaired and was back in

      19   a useful state.

      20        Q    Okay.  You can put that aside.

      21             To the best of your knowledge, did

      22   you ever see another estimate from

      23   Mr. Bennett?

      24        A    I don't recall.  He may have had --


                                                        24




       1   he may have shared another one before sending

       2   that one.  I don't know.  I mean, sometimes

       3   there are preliminary estimates and they are

       4   revised.  I don't know.

       5        Q    That one was the preliminary one,

       6   that's the earliest one that I saw.  But did

       7   you ever see a later one that was dated beyond

       8   July 20th of 2016?

       9        A    I don't remember.

      10        Q    I'm going to switch for a moment, if

      11   we could, to the income loss.  Okay?  Who was

      12   responsible for verifying or determining what

      13   amount would be paid for the income loss?

      14        A    That was also Dave Bennett's

      15   responsibility.

      16        Q    And did Mr. Bennett ever provide you

      17   with any kind of a written report or any

      18   information off of which you could base the

      19   amount of the income loss that was paid?

      20        A    Yes.  I believe he -- he had sent me

      21   things over the course of the claim's life.  I

      22   don't remember exactly what they were, but he

      23   gathered either leases or income statements or

      24   something from Randy to show what was being


                                                        25




       1   paid to, I guess, Clemens Family, LP, as or in

       2   consideration of rent.

       3        Q    And is it the policy or did this

       4   policy of insurance cover the total amount of

       5   the rent that was lost or was it the loss of

       6   actual income that they would have had from

       7   the rental property?

       8        A    Well, the language of the policy has

       9   been the income for rental properties, it's

      10   typically that is the rent, there's not

      11   usually, you know, profit and loss statement

      12   or something where there's a balancing of

      13   actual profit and expenses and things like

      14   that, so it's usually just rent.

      15        Q    So it is the position of Millers

      16   that, you know, if the rent is 10,000 a month,

      17   you reimburse the actual 10,000, not what the

      18   income would have been for the landlord?

      19        A    Correct.

      20        Q    And do you know what period of time

      21   was covered under the policy for that rental

      22   loss?

      23        A    Yeah.  The policy states it's 12

      24   months.  Typically the policy has a 72-hour


                                                        26




       1   waiting period before it begins, though we

       2   have an enhancement on our policy that it

       3   deletes that 72-hour waiting period.  And I

       4   believe it adds up to maybe 60 days for

       5   additional loss of income, I don't remember

       6   the exact language at this time.  But we did

       7   make a consideration for those additional 60

       8   days and paid an additional figure, I can't

       9   remember the exact amount, past 12 months to

      10   kind of help things conclude in claims.

      11        Q    Is it accurate -- I don't want to

      12   put words in your mouth -- what Millers would

      13   have done, what Millers did do is essentially

      14   pay 14 months of rental income?

      15        A    I don't think that's completely

      16   accurate.  I believe we paid a portion for the

      17   13th and 14th month.

      18        Q    Okay.

      19        A    I can't remember the exact dollar

      20   amounts or anything, but I believe the

      21   building was mostly back to the way it was

      22   prior to the claim within 12 months or at the

      23   end of that period, and we didn't pay the full

      24   monthly rent for those additional two months,


                                                        27




       1   from what I recall.  So if he had -- if the

       2   rent was 10,000 a month, there was I think

       3   three or four different spaces in there, so if

       4   three of them were back to normal and one was

       5   still being worked on, we wouldn't pay the

       6   full 10,000, we would pay only the portion

       7   that was still uninhabitable or unoccupied or

       8   still under construction.

       9        Q    And who made that decision about

      10   like the percentage that would be paid once

      11   there was a portion of the building?

      12        A    Dave Bennett calculated that with

      13   Randy to iron that out, because I think the --

      14   I can't remember the specifics, but he worked

      15   that out and had it laid out so Randy would

      16   understand it as well what we were paying for.

      17        Q    And did you receive any kind of a

      18   report from him or something in writing which

      19   told you what the amount you should pay is?

      20        A    Yeah, I think there either would

      21   have been a report or just an email saying,

      22   this is what we agreed was going to be paid.

      23        Q    Okay.  And was the Clemens Family

      24   Partnership also reimbursed for lost rent from


                                                        28




       1   a company called S-Bond Technologies?

       2        A    I have never heard the name so I'm

       3   not sure.  Is that one of the tenants of the

       4   building?

       5        Q    It was a tenant, yes.

       6        A    Okay.  Then, yeah, that would have

       7   been factored in to the rent calculation.

       8        Q    And, again, Mr. Bennett would be the

       9   person who put those figures together or

      10   calculated them?

      11        A    Yes.  I believe he gathered the

      12   leases or whatever agreements or income

      13   statements to show what was being paid.

      14        Q    Okay.  And what, if any,

      15   participation did you have in the

      16   investigation of the cause and origin of the

      17   fire that occurred at this location?

      18        A    We retained Schriver, I think it's,

      19   Fire and Explosion Investigations, so Brad

      20   Schriver, he was out there with I believe

      21   maybe one or two other cause and origin

      22   investigators to, you know, examine the scene

      23   and try to pinpoint exactly where the fire

      24   started and why.


                                                        29




       1        Q    And other than retaining that

       2   outside expert, did you personally have any

       3   involvement in that investigation?

       4        A    I was not there when they were doing

       5   the investigation, no.

       6        Q    And were you present during any

       7   examinations of the vehicle?

       8        A    I was not.

       9        Q    Have you participated in any

      10   meetings with any of the other insurance

      11   companies regarding the loss that occurred at

      12   the Clemens facility?

      13        A    I have not.

      14        Q    Did anyone else acting on behalf of

      15   Millers?

      16        A    I don't know.  I know, I mean, we've

      17   had a subrogation counsel.

      18        Q    I mean actually somebody from

      19   Millers?

      20        A    From Millers, that I don't know.  I

      21   don't believe so.

      22        Q    And have you personally had any

      23   discussions ever with anyone from Mercedes or

      24   Mercedes-Benz Vans regarding this claim?

       1        A    Not that I recall.

       7   BY MR. GARBARINO:

       8        Q    Just briefly, did you have any

       9   conversations with anyone from Bergey's Truck

      10   Leasing or anything like that in regards to

      11   this claim?

      12        A    Not that I recall.  I don't think

      13   they were there when I was on the scene, and

      14   that was really my main, you know, involvement

      15   of, you know, any discussions or anything, was

      16   really that day.  I don't know that Dave

      17   Bennett would have, but I don't know for sure.

      18        Q    And does Dave Bennett have a

      19   specific company that he works for, is he

      20   independent?

      21        A    Yeah, so he works for Elliott Claims

      22   Group or just Elliott Claims.

      23                  MR. GARBARINO:  That's all the

      24        questions I have.  Thank you.

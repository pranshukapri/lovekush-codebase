          1              MR. TODD:  Before we get started,

          2   Mr. Garvin, we would like to make a stipulation on

          3   the record that documents produced in this

          4   proceeding by either party which contain a Bates

          5   number or are labeled with a Bates number, we are

          6   stipulating that they are authentic business

          7   records and admissible.

          8              MR. GARVIN:  And Opposer will make

          9   that -- will agree to that stipulation.

         10              MR. TODD:  Okay.  Thank you.

         11                     LAWRENCE MEEKS,

         12   having been first duly sworn, testified as

         13   follows:

         14                       EXAMINATION

         15   BY MR. TODD:

         16      Q. Mr. Meeks, my name is Matt Todd, and I

         17   represent the Lombardi Foundation and the

         18   trademark opposition that has been filed by the

         19   Rotary Club of Houston against the Lombardi

         20   Foundation for its trademark, the Lombardi Award.

         21   I assume you have some degree of familiarity with

         22   the dispute?

         23      A. Uh-huh, I do.

         24      Q. Okay.  All right.  I'd like to hand you what

         25   we're going to mark as Deposition Exhibit




                                                                        6



          1   No. 1 which is the notice of the deposition for

          2   the Rotary Club of Houston.

          3                   (Exhibit 1 marked.)

          4      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen this notice

          5   before?

          6              THE WITNESS:  You sent me this, right,

          7   Mike?

          8              MR. GARVIN:  I do not -- I did not send

          9   you this one.

         10      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  Do you understand,

         11   Mr. Meeks, that you're here today as the

         12   representative of the Rotary Club of Houston?

         13      A. Yes.

         14      Q. Okay.  I would also like to hand you what

         15   we're going to mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 2,

         16   which is your -- the notice of your personal

         17   deposition.

         18                   (Exhibit 2 marked.)

         19      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen that before

         20   today?

         21      A. I don't think so.

         22              MR. GARVIN:  I mean, I'll just say for

         23   the record I --

         24              MR. TODD:  Okay.  That's fine.

         25              MR. GARVIN:  This came out yesterday.




                                                                        7



          1              MR. TODD:  It's fine.

          2      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  So there are -- it's not

          3   uncommon for this -- for these sort of proceedings

          4   to be run together.  So my intention is to take

          5   your deposition as the corporate representative

          6   and also take your personal deposition at the same

          7   time so that we can save time for the parties.

          8   What I will do in order to accommodate that is if

          9   I am asking a question where I expect a response

         10   from the Rotary Club of Houston, I will indicate

         11   that I'm asking, "What would Rotary's position be

         12   with regard to such and such?"  If I'm asking for

         13   your personal opinion or your personal testimony,

         14   I will say, "Mr. Meeks, what is your personal

         15   opinion or your personal testimony?"

         16      A. Okay.

         17      Q. Is that okay?

         18      A. That's fine, as long as you understand that

         19   I am the past president of the Rotary Club.  I'm

         20   not the current president of the Rotary Club.

         21      Q. Indeed I understand that.

         22              MR. GARVIN:  Yeah.

         23      A. So that -- and within Rotary that changes

         24   things in terms of, you know, what I say and

         25   whether it's binding on the Club, et cetera.




                                                                        8



          1              MR. GARVIN:  Yeah, I just want to

          2   interject, too.  Matt, you-all served a notice of

          3   a 30(b)(6) deposition, and we objected to several

          4   categories.  So Mr. Meeks is being produced to

          5   pursuant to certain specific topics in your prior

          6   notice as the corporate representative and -- and

          7   otherwise not.

          8              MR. TODD:  Understood.

          9              MR. GARVIN:  Yeah.

         10              MR. TODD:  If we get into a category

         11   where Mr. Meeks is not the appropriate witness for

         12   the category, then we can take that up at that

         13   time.

         14              MR. GARVIN:  Fair enough.

         15              MR. TODD:  And in those instances, I

         16   probably will be asking Mr. Meeks for his personal

         17   opinion even if he can't testify on behalf of the

         18   organization.

         19              MR. GARVIN:  Personal knowledge as

         20   opposed to personal opinion?

         21              MR. TODD:  Indeed.

         22              MR. GARVIN:  Fair enough.

         23              THE WITNESS:  And it will be up to you

         24   guys to decide whether I'm the appropriate witness

         25   or not.  I wouldn't have any idea.




                                                                        9



          1              MR. TODD:  We'll work it out.  We'll

          2   work it out.  Thank you, Mike and Mr. Meeks.

          3      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  So, Mr. Meeks, have

          4   you ever had your deposition taken before?

          5      A. I have.

          6      Q. Okay.  And what kind of a proceeding was

          7   that?

          8      A. Related to professional practice.  I'm an

          9   architect.  So in matters involving a client or a

         10   general contractor claim.

         11      Q. Okay.

         12      A. And I want to say two or three times in my

         13   career.

         14      Q. All right.  So you're sort of familiar with

         15   the way this goes?

         16      A. I am.

         17      Q. I ask the question.  You give the answer.  I

         18   try to let you finish your answer before I

         19   interrupt you.  You try to let me finish the

         20   question before you start the answer.  It's hard

         21   for people to do that.  It's hard for me to do

         22   that, but I'll try -- I'll do my best.

         23         If you need a break at any point, that's

         24   certainly fine.  Just let me know.  We can stop.

         25   My only request is that we don't do that when




                                                                       10



          1   there's a question pending.  So let's go ahead and

          2   finish out the answer to the question before we

          3   take the break.  If you do need to take a break to

          4   talk to Mr. Garvin about anything, that's also

          5   certainly fine.  But we'll -- Mr. Garvin and I

          6   will then need to have a little bit of a

          7   discussion about that once you come back.  So --

          8      A. Okay.

          9              THE WITNESS:  Mike, have you talked to

         10   them about why we rescheduled this, what I've been

         11   through?

         12              MR. GARVIN:  I have.  And just so

         13   everybody is on the same page, you know that

         14   Mr. Meeks has had some health problems.  And he's

         15   still confronting them, but he's a lot better.

         16   But he just -- there may be times he needs to take

         17   a pause because of those.

         18      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Certainly.  If at any point

         19   you don't feel well, you need a break, just let us

         20   know.  It's perfectly acceptable.  We do

         21   understand, and we're happy to accommodate that.

         22         So in order to prepare for this deposition,

         23   did you -- did you meet with anybody or did you

         24   look at any documents?  What did you do to

         25   prepare?




                                                                       11



          1      A. I've looked at some of the documents that

          2   Mike has provided.  I've spoken with Mike.  I did

          3   not talk to anybody else about this deposition,

          4   what I should say or what anybody else has said or

          5   any of those kinds of things at all.  I didn't

          6   think that would have any bearing on how I would

          7   respond to your questions.

          8      Q. Okay.  So documents that you reviewed, were

          9   they -- did you happen to know if they were

         10   documents that were produced or not produced in

         11   the proceeding?

         12      A. Mike would have to tell you that because

         13   they're in his email that he sent to me.

         14      Q. Okay.  Do you recall if they had a number in

         15   the bottom right-hand corner?

         16      A. No, I don't.

         17      Q. Okay.  Did you assist Mr. Garvin or his team

         18   with the preparation of responses to discovery

         19   requests in this matter?

         20              MR. GARVIN:  He's referring to, for

         21   example, interrogatories, those written questions

         22   that were served by Mr. Todd's client.

         23      A. Not that I recall.  So --

         24      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.

         25      A. -- I don't think we've had much discussion




                                                                       12



          1   at all really, just given the situation that I've

          2   been through personally.  I've had my foot off the

          3   gas in this matter pretty extensively.

          4      Q. It would have been probably some time ago

          5   that these requests were served.  And we need --

          6   we just want to make sure that we understand who

          7   was sort of responsible for helping Mr. Garvin

          8   gather the information.

          9      A. I did -- I did have a spreadsheet put

         10   together and provided it to Mike in answer to one

         11   of the questions.  So that I know specifically.

         12   If there were discussions on the phone or

         13   something like that, they were not extensive or

         14   long in nature.

         15      Q. Do you recall generally what the spreadsheet

         16   contained?

         17      A. Yeah, it contained revenue figures for the

         18   Lombardi Award event going back to -- five or six

         19   years at least.

         20      Q. Okay.  Did you gather any documents to

         21   assist Rotary Club in its proceeding here?

         22      A. No, I didn't.

         23      Q. Okay.  Do you have any documents now that

         24   are relevant to the proceeding?

         25      A. Not that I'm aware of.




                                                                       13



          1      Q. Do you know how the Rotary Club of Houston

          2   maintains its documentation with regard to the

          3   Lombardi Award?

          4      A. I know that we have a storeroom in a storage

          5   facility.  And I've never been there.  So, you

          6   know, I -- I didn't have a key for most of the

          7   time that I was president of the Club.  I

          8   transitioned out of being president at the end of

          9   June.  I gave that key to our current president.

         10   But I've never been to that storage room or was,

         11   you know, personally aware of anything that was in

         12   it.

         13      Q. Okay.  Are there electronic storage

         14   mechanisms or devices that the Rotary Club of

         15   Houston uses?

         16      A. I assume that there's -- there's -- some of

         17   that material exists, but I'm not personally aware

         18   of it.  I haven't been involved in it.  I mean,

         19   the Club administrator would know more about that

         20   than I.

         21      Q. Okay.  Who is the current Club

         22   administrator?

         23      A. Her name is Dena -- give me a minute.  I'll

         24   member her last name.  We can get you the name.

         25   Dena -- gosh, brain cramp.  Sorry.  It will come




                                                                       14



          1   to me in a couple of minutes, I'm sure.

          2      Q. Some of the documents that we have in this

          3   case are quite old.  They date back to the '70s,

          4   for example.  Do you know how the Rotary Club of

          5   Houston would have stored those types of documents

          6   or how they would have been found?

          7      A. No.

          8      Q. Do you know if the Rotary Club of Houston

          9   has a documentation retention policy?

         10      A. Not that I'm aware of.  I think there's a

         11   lot of enthusiasm and interest in it, but it's

         12   more of a grassroots by member -- by member kind

         13   of thing.  So there isn't any stated policy or --

         14   or structure that governs that that I'm aware of.

         15      Q. Okay.  And the Club administrator, she would

         16   be the person that would most likely be the person

         17   responsible for maintaining records in your

         18   opinion?

         19      A. Not necessarily.  And I'm not trying to make

         20   this difficult.  It's just that we have -- we have

         21   a number of people in the Club that are currently

         22   or formerly in the Club that have amassed, you

         23   know, mementos and different things that go with

         24   the history of the Club.

         25         So I know Phil Hampton might have some of




                                                                       15



          1   that kind of material.  I don't know specifically

          2   what he has.  I know that Angie Jimenez, who used

          3   to be with the Club and no longer is, is -- and

          4   this is all just hearsay, but widely discussed

          5   that -- that he took a lot of documentation with

          6   him and so on, not necessarily about this matter,

          7   but just stuff that he felt was his more than it

          8   was the Club's.

          9      Q. Sure.  Okay.

         10      A. So --

         11      Q. When there's a transition from -- from one

         12   president to the next, is there a process

         13   involved, or how does that happen?

         14      A. It -- it -- all of Rotary -- Rotary

         15   International, every Rotary Club gets new

         16   leadership on July 1st of every year.  And the

         17   vast majority of what is attended to in that

         18   transition is -- has to do with renewing

         19   memberships.  So while the Club gets completely

         20   new leadership, the Club also has to get all of

         21   its members renewed on that same date.

         22         The -- the big thing that overarches pretty

         23   much anybody's concern to anything else is filing

         24   that membership report with Rotary International

         25   at midnight on the last day of June.  So, you




                                                                       16



          1   know, I've been through this twice when I was

          2   coming in as president and then going out as

          3   president.  It -- it -- it consumes a lot of time.

          4      Q. Okay.  Are there any written guidelines or

          5   procedures for a president in terms of what you

          6   should do or how you should conduct meetings or

          7   what you should do with the board?

          8      A. There's probably a ton of that out there in

          9   reality.  I'm not sure that it's organized

         10   coordinated, consistent.  Different clubs are very

         11   willing to publish what they think the duties of

         12   officers are, but those are Club publications.

         13   Rotary International has a lot of guidelines, and

         14   they are all basically crafted to help a new

         15   president not fall on their face.

         16      Q. Does Rotary Club of Houston have any such

         17   guidelines?

         18      A. Not specifically, not beyond anything that

         19   I've already said.  A lot of stuff gets handled by

         20   tradition.

         21      Q. Okay.  And you raise an important point,

         22   sort of a point of order for the deposition.  When

         23   I say "Rotary" or "the Club," my intention is to

         24   refer to the Rotary Club of Houston.  If I'm going

         25   to ask you a question about Rotary International,




                                                                       17



          1   I'll try to say "Rotary International" so that we

          2   sort of know the difference.  I don't expect very

          3   many questions at all, if any, about Rotary

          4   International.

          5      A. Okay.

          6      Q. But if I say "Rotary" or "the Club," my

          7   intention is to mean the Rotary Club of Houston.

          8   If you have a question about that, just let me

          9   know; and I'll be more specific.

         10      A. All right.  Well, I'll try to keep track of

         11   that, because in my mind anytime somebody says

         12   "Rotary," it's not the Rotary Club of Houston.

         13   It's Rotary, et al.

         14      Q. Okay.  Then how about --

         15      A. So we'll work through it.

         16      Q. We'll work through it.  Fair enough.  Fair

         17   enough.  Let's talk a little bit about your

         18   personal history with Rotary.  When did you first

         19   join Rotary?

         20      A. September of 2013.

         21      Q. What motivated you to join?

         22      A. I was invited by a fellow businessman that

         23   was -- that had an office in the same office

         24   building that I'm in.

         25      Q. Is your office downtown?




                                                                       18



          1      A. No.  We're in Greenway Plaza.

          2      Q. Okay.  So your friend was a member of the

          3   downtown -- or the Club that we're talking about

          4   here today, the Rotary Club of Houston?

          5      A. Yes.

          6      Q. Okay.  What roles have you had in the Club

          7   since 2013?

          8      A. So I've been a director, which means I've

          9   served on the board of directors of the Rotary

         10   Club of Houston, which is different than the

         11   Foundation.  I think you probably understand that.

         12   If you don't, I'd be happy to explain that.  And

         13   then I served as president elect and president.

         14      Q. What years were you president elect?

         15      A. So my years -- my years as president elect

         16   ran from 2017 to 2018.

         17      Q. So you --

         18      A. Hang on.  Yeah, that's right, 2018.

         19      Q. So when were you president?

         20      A. 2018 to 2019.

         21      Q. And as I understand it, that means that you

         22   would then transition to the board of the Rotary

         23   Club of Houston Foundation after your president

         24   year?

         25      A. Yes.  Now I'm on that board.




                                                                       19



          1      Q. Okay.  Would your term for the board on

          2   the -- of the Foundation be 2019 to 2020?

          3      A. No.  It runs for three years.

          4      Q. Okay.

          5      A. And it ends with you being the chairman of

          6   that board.

          7      Q. Okay.  So you will be chairman of that board

          8   in 2022?

          9      A. Yeah, I think so.  I think so.

         10      Q. Roughly.  Okay.  What were some of the

         11   initiatives for Rotary Club of Houston when you

         12   were president?

         13      A. What do you mean by "initiatives"?

         14      Q. What programs did the Rotary Club of Houston

         15   put on under your tenure, fundraising programs,

         16   events, community?

         17      A. While I was president?

         18      Q. While you were president.

         19      A. So we had a Distinguished Citizen's Award

         20   event that's a fundraiser for the Club.  Welcome

         21   Wilson, Sr., was our honoree.  We also host a

         22   regular monthly schedule of events, like Rotary

         23   House Hospitality Night, for example.  We put on a

         24   lunch for veterans during -- it's the Veterans Day

         25   lunch.  And it's always as close to Veterans




                                                                       20



          1   Day -- whatever the Thursday is closest to

          2   Veterans Day at the Junior League, another of our

          3   big events.  We were going to have a golf

          4   tournament during my year, but we cancelled that.

          5         Gosh, what else?  I'm sure there's some

          6   other things, but -- you know, if I had a calendar

          7   in front of me or something like that, I could

          8   give you an exhaustive list.

          9      Q. Okay.  The -- do you engage -- does the

         10   Rotary Club of Houston engage in fundraising for

         11   any of these events from outside sources?

         12      A. Do we solicit -- ask for sponsorships?

         13      Q. Yes.

         14      A. Yes, we do.

         15      Q. For Distinguished Citizen, for example?

         16      A. Yes, absolutely.

         17      Q. Who would be, like, perhaps -- like an

         18   example sponsor or donor to that?

         19      A. People -- people and companies out in the

         20   business community.

         21      Q. Do you remember there being, like, a

         22   primary, like, keynote-type sponsor in your year?

         23      A. We typically did not have keynotes.  You

         24   know, we had sponsorship levels that people could

         25   participate in based on, you know, an ascending or




                                                                       21



          1   descending amount of money classifying them as a

          2   gold, platinum, or silver, that kind of thing.

          3      Q. Do you remember for your year with the

          4   Distinguished Citizen Award who might have been

          5   the biggest sponsor?

          6      A. There were a number of sponsors in the

          7   3,000-dollar range.  We may have had one person

          8   bigger than that.  I don't remember specifically.

          9   I'm sorry.

         10      Q. Okay.  Do you -- did you have any

         11   association with any celebrities or public figures

         12   in association with any of these events?

         13      A. Our -- our master of ceremonies at the DCA

         14   was a very well-known reporter here in Tucson.

         15   And I'm trying to think of his name.

         16              MR. GARVIN:  You just said Tucson.

         17              THE WITNESS:  I did, didn't I?

         18      A. Sorry guys.  Here in Houston.

         19      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  It's okay.

         20      A. I can look the name up and let you know, but

         21   he's a well-known person, master of ceremonies.

         22      Q. Is the Distinguished Citizen Award named

         23   after anyone?  Is there a name for that award

         24   other than the Rotary Distinguished Citizen Award?

         25      A. That's the name.




                                                                       22



          1      Q. It is the Rotary Distinguished Citizen

          2   Award?

          3      A. (Witness nodding head up and down.)

          4      Q. Okay.  To your knowledge, does Rotary Club

          5   of Houston currently offer any trophies or awards

          6   that are associated with any public persona or

          7   celebrity or individual?

          8      A. We're not currently doing that.

          9      Q. During your tenure as president, was there a

         10   Lombardi Award dinner or event?

         11      A. No.

         12      Q. No?  Okay.  So by the time you were

         13   president, the -- well, the dispute had already

         14   begun.  Is that a fair statement?

         15      A. Yeah, well before I was president.

         16      Q. Well before.  Okay.  You were also at one

         17   time a member of the Lombardi Foundation.  Is that

         18   correct?

         19      A. I was.

         20      Q. Okay.  How long were you a member of the

         21   Lombardi Foundation?

         22      A. I'm not aware of what the time frame was.  I

         23   agreed to be in that foundation only in as much

         24   as -- and I conditioned that that I would decide

         25   after the first meeting whether or not it was




                                                                       23



          1   appropriate for me to continue on.  I attended the

          2   first board meeting -- what I thought was the

          3   first board meeting or assumed was the first board

          4   meeting and immediately resigned at the end of

          5   that meeting.

          6      Q. Okay.  So you -- you -- what made you decide

          7   to join the Foundation to begin with?

          8      A. I was asked to be on it, along with a number

          9   of other people from the Rotary Club.  And my

         10   perception was that -- that being there would lend

         11   itself to creating some kind of a bridge or -- or

         12   establishing a -- reestablishing a cooperative

         13   agreement with the family.

         14      Q. And you attended one meeting you said?

         15      A. By phone.

         16      Q. By telephone?

         17      A. Uh-huh.

         18      Q. Okay.

         19      A. I was made aware of it at the last minute

         20   and dialed in.

         21      Q. Do you recall what occurred at that meeting?

         22      A. Yeah.  Rick Slemaker and Spencer Tillman

         23   basically talked to John Lombardi and other -- I'm

         24   not even sure who attended the meeting, to be

         25   candid with you.  I was not aware -- made aware of




                                                                       24



          1   that.  I received no minutes.  And they talked

          2   about what they wanted to do with the Lombardi

          3   Award now that Rotary was removed from it in their

          4   opinion.

          5      Q. And what was your -- what was your reaction

          6   to that at the time?

          7      A. I was horrified.

          8      Q. Why?

          9      A. Because a number of things were said in that

         10   meeting that I didn't feel were true in regards to

         11   Rotary's actions and behavior in presenting the

         12   award.

         13      Q. Okay.  Did you -- while you were a member of

         14   the Rotary Club of Houston, did you ever serve on

         15   the Lombardi Award Committee?

         16      A. I did.

         17      Q. What years did you serve on the committee?

         18      A. During Rick's year.

         19      Q. So that would have been 2015?

         20      A. No.  Rick -- I'm sorry.  Rick Olsen's year.

         21      Q. Okay.

         22      A. I was also on it during Rick Slemaker's

         23   year.

         24      Q. So you served on the Lombardi Award

         25   Committee for two events, let's say?




                                                                       25



          1      A. One event.  On one event only.

          2      Q. One event only?

          3      A. Uh-huh.

          4      Q. And then -- and Rick -- so that would have

          5   been for Mr. Slemaker's year?

          6      A. Uh-huh.

          7      Q. And then for Mr. Olsen's year, you were on

          8   the committee, but there was no event?

          9      A. Right.

         10      Q. Okay.  Did you attend the Lombardi Award

         11   event proceedings before your years on the

         12   committee?

         13      A. I attended the -- I attended the last one,

         14   the last event that the Rotary Club of Houston was

         15   in charge of.

         16      Q. Okay.  But your first year, 2013, you did

         17   not attend?

         18      A. No.

         19      Q. Okay.  What do you know from your work on

         20   the committee about how Rotary Club of Houston

         21   manages the money and the proceeds that are taken

         22   in as a result of the event?

         23      A. Can you be more specific?

         24      Q. Sure.  So does the Rotary Club of Houston

         25   collect money for the -- from sponsors for the




                                                                       26



          1   Lombardi Award dinner?

          2      A. Yes.

          3      Q. Does it pay money to charities as a result

          4   of the dinner?

          5      A. Yes.

          6      Q. Is it the Rotary Club of Houston or the

          7   Rotary Club of Houston Foundation that pays money

          8   to charity?

          9      A. That's a specific that I'm unsure of.

         10   The -- the money goes into the Foundation because

         11   it's a 501(c)(3).  Where the check gets written,

         12   whether it gets written from the Foundation or

         13   transferred to the Club and written out of the

         14   Club, I'm -- candidly I'm not sure.

         15      Q. Okay.  What other entities have a role

         16   either as sponsor or partner or contributor with

         17   regard to the Lombardi Award event?

         18      A. Okay.  You said sponsor, contributor,

         19   participant?

         20      Q. Sure.  So what other entities are associated

         21   with this event?

         22      A. Currently?

         23      Q. During your tenure.

         24      A. Well, we had a contract with Axiom to

         25   produce the event.




                                                                       27



          1      Q. Okay.  Was there a relationship with the

          2   American Cancer Society?

          3      A. As a -- as a recipient of proceeds.

          4      Q. Did they help you promote the event?

          5      A. I wasn't involved in the public relations or

          6   the advertising or those kinds of elements of the

          7   effort.  So I can't say specifically that they did

          8   or didn't.  I believe they did.

          9      Q. When you were on the Lombardi Award

         10   Committee, do you recall any meetings with the

         11   American Cancer Society?

         12      A. Nothing that I attended.

         13      Q. Do you know during your tenure on the

         14   committee or as president who the funds from the

         15   event were distributed to?

         16      A. We've produced a spreadsheet that identifies

         17   the recipients.

         18      Q. Do you have any recollection of who that

         19   might have been?

         20      A. I believe the American Cancer Society, Texas

         21   Children's Hospital, and MD Anderson, but that's

         22   in the spreadsheet.

         23      Q. Do you recall any members of the American

         24   Cancer Society attending any -- any Rotary Club of

         25   Houston meetings?




                                                                       28



          1      A. I'm not sure.  I'm not certain.

          2      Q. Do you personally know anybody that's

          3   employed with or associated -- employed by or

          4   associated with the American Cancer Society?

          5      A. No.

          6      Q. Do you know any member of the Lombardi

          7   family?

          8      A. Personally?

          9      Q. Sure.

         10      A. I mean, no.

         11      Q. Have you ever met a member of the Lombardi

         12   family?

         13      A. I believe I did meet John Lombardi at the

         14   last event that we produced.

         15      Q. Do you -- have you ever -- to your

         16   knowledge, have you ever been in a meeting with

         17   him?

         18      A. Other than that first board meeting of the

         19   Lombardi Foundation, no.

         20      Q. Did he speak at that meeting?

         21      A. Yes.

         22      Q. Have you ever met Vince Lombardi, Jr.?

         23      A. No.

         24      Q. Do you know Steve Werner?

         25      A. No.




                                                                       29



          1      Q. During your tenure as president, was there

          2   any reporting to the Lombardi family about the

          3   Lombardi Award event?

          4      A. Not that I'm aware of while I was president.

          5      Q. How about while you were on the Lombardi

          6   Award Committee?  Was there any communication to

          7   the family about the event?

          8      A. Rick Slemaker represented that he

          9   communicated with them on a regular basis.

         10      Q. Okay.  But there was no written reporting or

         11   accounting or anything like that that you recall?

         12      A. Not that I'm aware of.

         13      Q. Do you know if there's a reason why they

         14   didn't receive any information and reports?

         15      A. I'm not aware that any information was

         16   withheld from them.  I'm not aware that any

         17   information was given to them.

         18      Q. Okay.

         19      A. A great deal of what happened when I was on

         20   the committee in Rick Slemaker's year was between

         21   Rick and the Lombardi family.  The committee

         22   struggled with the lack of transparency.

         23      Q. What does that mean?

         24      A. It means that there was a lot of

         25   representation being made that seemed to be




                                                                       30



          1   contrary to what the Rotary Club had traditionally

          2   done.  There was friction.

          3      Q. Okay.  When you were on the call with

          4   Mr. John Lombardi at the Lombardi Foundation, did

          5   he -- did he say anything about that to your

          6   memory?

          7      A. Not specifically.

          8      Q. You're on the Foundation board currently,

          9   correct?

         10      A. Uh-huh.

         11      Q. I'd like to ask you a little bit about the

         12   communications on the board about the proceeding.

         13   And having already had some testimony about this

         14   in this proceeding, I know that there are some

         15   concerns about privilege with regard to what is

         16   going on at those meetings and how this proceeding

         17   is being discussed.  But without revealing any

         18   discussion with any attorneys, can you tell me is

         19   this dispute discussed in Foundation board

         20   meetings?

         21      A. It's -- it's a topic that comes up.

         22      Q. Is it sort of like a dominant topic?  Is it

         23   the primary topic?

         24      A. I wouldn't say that.  It -- it is a topic,

         25   but there's other things that the Foundation has




                                                                       31



          1   to pay attention to.  So it's part of -- part of

          2   dealing with things.

          3      Q. Is the Foundation board and the Rotary Club

          4   of Houston leadership, are they sort of aligned

          5   here?  Like, they sort of -- they all have the

          6   same vision of the proceeding generally speaking?

          7      A. Generally they tend to be aligned.

          8   Differences come out in terms of establishing

          9   budgets and different amounts of spend for -- for

         10   charitable efforts and so on that the Club is

         11   involved in.  So I think we fixed a lot of those

         12   issues while I was president because we -- we

         13   aligned our financial people between the board and

         14   the Foundation very nicely.  So that resolved a

         15   lot of those discussions.

         16      Q. Are there -- are there written

         17   communications between the Foundation board and

         18   the Rotary Club of Houston about this dispute?

         19      A. That's pretty broad.  But in a broad sense,

         20   I would say not that I'm specifically aware of.

         21      Q. Is one or the other in control of what

         22   happens in this dispute?

         23              MR. GARVIN:  I am going to object.  I

         24   think we're veering really far from anything

         25   that's relevant, and I'm -- at some point I'm just




                                                                       32



          1   going to, you know, seek a protective order if I

          2   need to.  Because I don't think it's -- how

          3   different people from either place feel about this

          4   matter is relevant to the issues that are before

          5   the TTAB.  So I'm just going to ask you to limit

          6   your questions.  And if -- if we can't do that,

          7   then we'll just have to reserve this and -- and

          8   talk with the board about whether or not that's

          9   relevant.

         10              MR. TODD:  Well, I'm just trying to get

         11   to the bottom of who is in charge here.  Is it the

         12   Foundation or the board -- or the Club?

         13              MR. GARVIN:  I mean, the truth is I

         14   don't -- again, I don't understand why that's

         15   relevant.  I mean, there's a legal dispute between

         16   parties.  And who makes the decisions is not

         17   relevant to the issues before the TTAB.  I just

         18   really think it's veering way off the rails.  And

         19   I just -- I don't think it's appropriate, and I'm

         20   going to cut it off if we can't come up with

         21   some -- some way it's relevant to the issues

         22   before the board.

         23              MR. TODD:  I think it's relevant with

         24   regard to, let's say, ownership of the mark.

         25              MR. GARVIN:  I'm just going to




                                                                       33



          1   respectfully disagree.  I mean, whoever makes the

          2   decisions in this litigation is who makes it.  So

          3   I -- I'd like to move on.  And if we can't, let's

          4   just reserve it and have a discussion with the

          5   TTAB about it.

          6              MR. TODD:  Okay.  We can reserve it.

          7              MR. GARVIN:  Okay.

          8      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  To your knowledge,

          9   have there been communications with Rotary

         10   International about the dispute?

         11      A. Again, that's very broad.  So is -- is

         12   the -- is -- for example, is the district -- is

         13   the district governor part of Rotary International

         14   in your mind?

         15      Q. Yes.

         16      A. There's been communications with -- with all

         17   three of the governors that were -- that were in

         18   office during the width of this issue.

         19      Q. Okay.  Is it -- is it regular or sporadic?

         20      A. Within my knowledge specifically?

         21      Q. Within your knowledge, yeah.

         22      A. Extremely sporadic.

         23      Q. Okay.  We're going to transition to look at

         24   some documents here for a little while.  And we

         25   are at 3.  So I would like to hand you what we're




                                                                       34



          1   going to mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 3.

          2                   (Exhibit 3 marked.)

          3      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  I'll give you just a moment

          4   to familiarize yourself with it.

          5      A. It's hard to read.

          6      Q. Okay.  Have you seen this document before?

          7      A. I believe I have.

          8      Q. Okay.  Do you recall in what context?

          9      A. No.

         10      Q. Did you see it while you were president?  Do

         11   you remember?

         12      A. I think I've probably seen it more than

         13   once, once -- maybe once during president and a

         14   time before that.

         15      Q. Okay.  I'd like to direct you to sort of

         16   where it begins below the header.  And I

         17   acknowledge that it is difficult to read, but let

         18   me see if I can do my best.  I think it says --

         19              MR. GARVIN:  Can I go off for a quick

         20   second.

         21      Q. Yeah.

         22                   (Off the record.)

         23      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Let's go ahead and mark

         24   Exhibit No. 4.

         25                  (Exhibit 4 marked.)




                                                                       35



          1      A. Where does the quote start?

          2      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  So one, two -- third

          3   paragraph down, which begins with, "Mrs. Vince T.

          4   Lombardi."

          5      A. Okay.

          6      Q. Okay.  I will represent to you that -- that

          7   we believe that that's a -- an accurate quote from

          8   the actual telegram.  It appears to be what the

          9   telegram says.  So with regard to -- let's look at

         10   Exhibit No. 4 and that quote.  Having read that,

         11   what -- what does that quote mean to you

         12   personally?

         13      A. What that quote means to me is that

         14   Mrs. Lombardi authorized the Rotary Club of

         15   Houston to use Vince Lombardi's name in putting

         16   together a national award.

         17      Q. Okay.  When you were -- when you were

         18   president -- let me back that up.

         19         When you were a member of the committee, was

         20   there any discussion about what the nature of your

         21   authority would be to use Mr. Lombardi's image?

         22      A. Not that I'm aware of.

         23      Q. Was it assumed that you could and there was

         24   no -- nobody ever questioned it or brought it up

         25   in a conversation?




                                                                       36



          1      A. When I was involved in the committee, we

          2   were working on the 47th annual presentation of

          3   the award.

          4      Q. Okay.

          5      A. So that's where I was.

          6      Q. When you look at the quote in Exhibit 4 and

          7   it says, "...authorizes the American Cancer

          8   Society and the Rotary Club of Houston to

          9   establish," do you take that to mean forever?

         10      A. Yes, I do.

         11      Q. Do you believe that by saying "authorizes"

         12   that Mrs. Lombardi was giving the Rotary Club of

         13   Houston some kind of permanent right to the

         14   Lombardi name?

         15      A. She authorized us to use his name.

         16      Q. Okay.  Do you believe that that use would be

         17   unrestricted?

         18      A. I don't see any restrictions in that -- in

         19   those words, to be candid with you.

         20      Q. Okay.  Do you see any language in there that

         21   relates to any sort of permanence, like "aside" or

         22   "forever" or "perpetual"?

         23      A. I don't see those specific words.

         24      Q. Anything that would indicate that it would

         25   be forever?




                                                                       37



          1      A. There's nothing there that indicates that

          2   it's not.

          3      Q. Okay.

          4      A. There's no term established that I can see.

          5      Q. I'd like to hand you what we're going to

          6   mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 5.

          7                   (Exhibit 5 marked.)

          8      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Mr. Meeks, have you seen this

          9   document before?

         10      A. Not that I specifically recall.

         11      Q. Okay.  If you flip to the second page, the

         12   signatory is a Mr. Kirk W. Reimann.  Do you know

         13   who he is?

         14      A. No.

         15      Q. And the addressee is a Mr. C.D. Tinsley.  Do

         16   you know who he is?

         17      A. No, I don't.

         18      Q. Okay.  The first paragraph of the letter

         19   says, "As you will be president of Rotary during

         20   the next Lombardi Award Banquet in 1979, I hope

         21   that I may share some of the concerns that have

         22   been expressed by some of our American Cancer

         23   Society members and by some Rotarian members."

         24         Did I read that correctly?

         25      A. Yeah.




                                                                       38



          1      Q. Okay.  So it appears that at least

          2   Mr. C.D. Tinsley is going to be the next president

          3   of Rotary that Mr. Reimann is referring to, at

          4   least according to Mr. Reimann, correct?

          5      A. It would seem so.

          6      Q. Okay.  The second paragraph says, "The first

          7   concern is the rather tenuous nature of our

          8   original authority for the Rotary Club to sponsor

          9   the Lombardi Award Dinner with the proceeds to go

         10   to the American Cancer Society.  As you know, we

         11   have only a telegram authorizing us to proceed

         12   with such dinners.  The success of the dinner

         13   indicates that there may very well be additional

         14   organizations who would relish the opportunity to

         15   put on a similar event."

         16         Did I read that correctly?

         17      A. Uh-huh.

         18      Q. Okay.  So how would you interpret the

         19   meaning of that first sentence, "The first concern

         20   is the rather tenuous nature of our original

         21   authority"?  What does that mean to you?

         22      A. Well, to be candid with you, having just

         23   been president of this Club for a year and having

         24   encountered so many different opinions in response

         25   to a speaker or a topic from so many corners of




                                                                       39



          1   the room, I read this without having any idea of

          2   what the context is, who these people are, what

          3   the personalities were that they were exerting

          4   over the Club, those kinds of things.  I have

          5   absolutely no idea if this letter is pandering or

          6   any of those kinds of things.  So it's -- it's

          7   really hard to respond to this as -- as anything

          8   that would be factual and specific over the

          9   general will or tenure of the Club.

         10      Q. Do you believe the Rotary Club of Houston's

         11   authority is tenuous with regard to the award?

         12      A. Not in the least.

         13      Q. Why not?

         14      A. Because I believe we were given permission

         15   to use Lombardi's name, and we built an award

         16   around that and presented it for 47 years.  And so

         17   you take -- do the math, whatever 1979 is out of

         18   that.  You know, this is eight years into it --

         19   seven or eight years into it, and the award

         20   continued on well past that.  So I don't see it as

         21   tenuous from where I'm sitting.

         22      Q. But it appears that perhaps at least

         23   Mr. Reimann did, whoever he may be?

         24      A. It may be.

         25      Q. Okay.




                                                                       40



          1      A. I mean, he identifies himself as executive

          2   vice president.  I don't have any idea whether

          3   that pertains to the Rotary Club of Houston or

          4   not.

          5      Q. In the one, two, three -- fourth paragraph

          6   down, it says, "In conversation with my colleagues

          7   in New York, it has been indicated that Joe

          8   Lombardi, Vince's brother, has Marie's power of

          9   attorney, and we should be able to get such a

         10   letter without creating too much of a fuss."

         11         Do you know if there was ever any such

         12   letter authorizing the Club beyond the telegram?

         13      A. I don't know.

         14      Q. What does the Lombardi name mean to you

         15   personally?  What connotation does it have for

         16   you?

         17      A. I've always admired Vince Lombardi, the

         18   coach, and honored the work that he did.  And

         19   I've -- I've also had a great deal of regard and

         20   respect for the Lombardi Award.

         21      Q. So when you say you admire Vince Lombardi,

         22   what -- why?  For what reason?

         23      A. For his coaching skills, his motivational

         24   abilities, the way he -- he took in people and

         25   made great football players out of them and stood




                                                                       41



          1   them up as people in the community.  He's just a

          2   great example.

          3      Q. So Coach Lombardi's image is something that

          4   Rotary wanted to promote in conjunction with

          5   the -- its award?  Is that correct?

          6      A. Clearly they wanted his name associated with

          7   the award.

          8      Q. Because of some of the qualities that you've

          9   mentioned, or are there others?

         10      A. That would be assumptive on my part, but

         11   yeah.

         12      Q. Was there ever any discussion at the Rotary

         13   Club of Houston while you were either on the

         14   committee or as president about why to give the

         15   Lombardi Award?

         16      A. No, not -- not that I can specifically

         17   recall.

         18      Q. Do you know what the Club's motivation would

         19   have been to give the award or to continue the

         20   award?

         21      A. Well, primarily I would say as a -- as a

         22   fundraiser for cancer research.

         23      Q. Okay.  So was the -- the primary motivation

         24   then for awarding the award would be to raise

         25   money for cancer research.  And then would that




                                                                       42



          1   make the athletic piece a secondary concern, sort

          2   of the award to the students?  So what was -- what

          3   was primary, and what was secondary?  Or can you

          4   classify it that way?

          5      A. I've never thought of it that way.

          6      Q. Okay.  Was it ever discussed?

          7      A. Oh, I don't -- I don't recall anybody ever

          8   taking the -- the Lombardi Award apart into its

          9   pieces like that.

         10      Q. Okay.  Do you associate the Lombardi name

         11   with leadership?

         12      A. I associate Vince Lombardi with leadership.

         13      Q. Okay.  Do you associate either Vince

         14   Lombardi or the Lombardi family name with

         15   integrity?

         16      A. I associate Vince Lombardi's name with

         17   integrity.

         18      Q. Okay.  Would you associate the Lombardi name

         19   or the Vince Lombardi name with sportsmanship?

         20      A. His name, yes.

         21      Q. Okay.  Would you associate the Lombardi

         22   name -- family name or Vince Lombardi's name with

         23   cancer?

         24      A. I associate the award with that, with

         25   cancer.




                                                                       43



          1      Q. Okay.  How about with cancer research?

          2      A. The same answer.

          3      Q. Looking back at Exhibit No. 5 at the very

          4   last paragraph, it says, "The third concern" --

          5   I'm sorry, last paragraph on the first page.

          6   Excuse me.  It says, "The third concern is the

          7   need for an established budget approved by

          8   appropriate Rotary and American Cancer Society

          9   directors."

         10         Do you see that sentence I'm talking about

         11   there?

         12      A. Uh-huh.

         13      Q. Okay.  Did the Lombardi Award -- during your

         14   tenure either as chair of the committee or as

         15   president, was there a budget that was approved

         16   for the award?

         17      A. I'm trying to understand what -- in the

         18   context of your question and what this is saying

         19   what "an established budget" actually means.

         20      Q. Okay.  So when you were on the committee,

         21   was there a budget for the event?  Without

         22   reference to this document, just was there a

         23   budget for the event?

         24      A. That's a hard question to answer because

         25   the -- the cost of putting the event on was a




                                                                       44



          1   dynamic set of variables.

          2      Q. Okay.

          3      A. There -- there was never anything that I was

          4   aware of that was a cutoff on how much -- you

          5   know, how much we could spend or how much we

          6   should spend based on what we needed to spend to

          7   put on a great event.

          8      Q. Okay.  So were there fundraising targets?

          9   Like, you wanted to raise a certain amount of

         10   money?  Was there something like that?

         11      A. Everybody had a different opinion about how

         12   much money could be raised.

         13      Q. Okay.  And was there somebody keeping an eye

         14   on expenses?

         15      A. The cost of putting the event together kind

         16   of assembled itself over a span of meetings.  So,

         17   you know, where -- where the -- the costs were

         18   from month to month was reviewed.

         19      Q. Over the course of that sort of performance

         20   period, how would you ensure that there was going

         21   to be money left to donate; in other words, that

         22   the expenses wouldn't consume the fundraiser?

         23      A. I'm not sure I understand the question.  I'm

         24   sorry.  It's not you.  It's me.  Could you ask me

         25   the question again specifically?




                                                                       45



          1      Q. Sure.  I'm just trying to get an idea of how

          2   the committee would have managed a budget --

          3   undefined budget, just a sort of, you know, income

          4   in, expenses out process for the award.  In other

          5   words, you -- you raised money, you paid expenses,

          6   and you had to make a donation to charity.  Is

          7   that sort of like the general process?

          8      A. Generally, yeah.

          9      Q. Okay.  So what I'm trying to get at is was

         10   there an idea in advance about what that process

         11   would look like in terms of fundraising and

         12   expense and hopeful donations?

         13      A. Again, it was a dynamic situation the year

         14   that I was on the committee and Rick Slemaker was

         15   in charge of the event.  The -- there were a lot

         16   of differences of opinion on what needed to be a

         17   part of the event.  There were differences of

         18   opinion on -- and those differences of opinion

         19   became more urgent, if you will, based on the cost

         20   of those things that were being added to the

         21   event.

         22         So it tended to be a number of conversations

         23   along the line of, "Why are we doing this this

         24   year?  We didn't do it last year."  "Why are we

         25   not doing something last year" -- or "this year




                                                                       46



          1   that we did do last year and previous years," and

          2   so on.  So with me being new to that event at that

          3   point in time, it was -- there were a number of --

          4   any number of contentious moments where it seemed

          5   to me that the amount of money being spent only

          6   made sense by people going out and selling more

          7   sponsorships, which I think is a natural process.

          8      Q. Okay.

          9      A. But absent the continuity that other people

         10   had, it's hard for me to specifically answer your

         11   question.

         12      Q. Did the American Cancer Society have a voice

         13   in that process?

         14      A. I assume they did.

         15      Q. Okay.  Did you -- but did they ever attend a

         16   meeting that you were at?

         17      A. There were people on the committee that were

         18   responsible for dialoguing with them.

         19      Q. Okay.  Did the Lombardi family have a say in

         20   that process?

         21      A. I assume they did.

         22      Q. Do you have any personal knowledge that they

         23   did?

         24      A. No, I don't.

         25      Q. Okay.  Do you recall during your year on the




                                                                       47



          1   committee how much money was donated to charity

          2   following the event?

          3      A. No, I don't, but it's on the spreadsheet.

          4      Q. Okay.  Do you have any historical knowledge

          5   about donations to charities sort of over time?

          6      A. Nothing specific.

          7      Q. Do you know if there's a trend up or down?

          8   Has it been increased -- was it increasing or

          9   decreasing?

         10      A. I think the number moved around.  So I can't

         11   tell you that -- that -- that -- you know, I -- I

         12   personally didn't have a pulse of this.  I was on

         13   the committee for one year, and I attended the

         14   event that year.  So --

         15      Q. Okay.

         16      A. -- somewhat limited knowledge.

         17      Q. And you don't recall how much -- there was

         18   no sort of celebration about how much was donated

         19   that would spur your memory or --

         20      A. Yeah, I believe there was.

         21      Q. Okay.

         22      A. But I don't remember the specifics of it.

         23      Q. And I believe you said that to your

         24   knowledge there were no reports made to the

         25   Lombardi family about this event.  Is that




                                                                       48



          1   correct?

          2      A. Nothing that I'm specifically aware of.

          3      Q. I would like to hand you what we will mark

          4   as Deposition Exhibit No. 6.

          5                  (Exhibit 6 marked.)

          6      A. Okay.

          7      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen this document

          8   before?

          9      A. Not that I recall.

         10      Q. Okay.  At the top it has a -- some version

         11   of letterhead, I guess, that says "Madeline and

         12   George Werner" and a phone number.  Do you know

         13   who Madeline Warner is or George Warner?

         14      A. No.

         15      Q. Have you ever heard of them before?

         16      A. No.

         17      Q. Okay.  And then it's addressed to a

         18   Mr. Jack Hardison, Executive Vice President,

         19   American Cancer Society.  Have you ever heard of

         20   Mr. Hardison before?

         21      A. No.

         22      Q. Okay.  So the first paragraph of that letter

         23   says, "Since the November 1985 Lombardi Award

         24   Dinner, it has been my intention to write to you

         25   to reaffirm the Lombardi Family decision to




                                                                       49



          1   exclusively have the American Cancer

          2   Society/Houston the sole recipient of the proceeds

          3   of the annual dinner."

          4         Did I read that correctly?

          5      A. Yes.

          6      Q. Do you have any idea why Ms. Werner would

          7   need to reaffirm --

          8      A. No.

          9      Q. -- permission here --

         10      A. No.

         11      Q. -- or reaffirm the decision?

         12      A. No idea.

         13      Q. Okay.  Is that some indication to you that

         14   perhaps prior decisions weren't permanent?

         15      A. No, it really isn't.

         16      Q. Okay.

         17      A. To -- for it to be -- for that to be the

         18   case, you'd have to assume that this is some kind

         19   of summary document, and I just don't see it that

         20   way.

         21      Q. What do you mean by that?

         22      A. Well, it goes back to my answer on the

         23   previous document.  Having come out of being

         24   president of this Club for a year and

         25   understanding that anybody can write a letter to




                                                                       50



          1   anybody for any reason, I just don't attach a lot

          2   of specific gravity to something that's -- that's

          3   not in the context of what's going on at the

          4   moment.  I have no idea of what the context was.

          5   So I don't know if this letter is straight down

          6   the middle of an issue or it comes out of the

          7   blue, no idea.

          8      Q. Is that the same for the communication

          9   that's the telegram?  Do you feel the same way

         10   about that?

         11      A. No, I think that that's different because it

         12   specifically gives the Rotary Club of Houston the

         13   right to use Vince Lombardi's name.  And that's

         14   more or less reaffirmed in this letter.

         15      Q. So the second paragraph says, "In 1970 when

         16   the Rotary Club of Houston called me for

         17   permission to use the Lombardi" -- "the name

         18   Lombardi in conjunction with Lineman of the Year

         19   Award dinner in honor of my brother Vince, it

         20   never occurred to me that from then to now the

         21   proceeds of the dinner would grow to such

         22   propositions."

         23         Do you see what I'm pointing to there?

         24      A. Uh-huh.

         25      Q. So she's -- Mrs. Werner, who is the




                                                                       51



          1   signatory here, is referencing a call from Houston

          2   for permission, correct?

          3      A. To use the name Lombardi, yes.

          4      Q. So is this some kind of a reflection of what

          5   was contained in the telegram?

          6      A. I see a link to that.

          7      Q. Okay.  And is there any indication in there

          8   that this -- this grant -- is she referencing that

          9   the grant of permission in here is permanent in

         10   some way?

         11      A. I don't -- I don't know how to answer that

         12   one way or the other.  I don't really infer

         13   anything of that kind into this.  It seems to me

         14   that this recognizes that they see that having the

         15   Rotary Club of Houston create and deploy the

         16   Lombardi Award year over year has been very

         17   successful.

         18      Q. And referencing the permission from the

         19   family?

         20      A. To use the name.

         21      Q. Okay.  Let's take a break.

         22                       (Recess.)

         23      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Mr. Meeks, I'm going to hand

         24   you what we will mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 7.

         25                  (Exhibit 7 marked.)




                                                                       52



          1      A. Okay.

          2      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  Have you seen this

          3   document before, Mr. Meeks?

          4      A. Not that I recall.

          5      Q. Okay.  I'll represent to you this is a

          6   document that was produced to us by the Rotary

          7   Club of Houston in this proceeding, indicated by

          8   the number at the bottom there that says RCH0 -- a

          9   bunch of zeros and then 26.

         10      A. Uh-huh.

         11      Q. Okay?  Do you see at the top -- at the very

         12   top left corner, it has a website address and it

         13   says "rotarylombardiaward.com"?

         14      A. Uh-huh.

         15      Q. Is that a website that is maintained by the

         16   Rotary Club of Houston?

         17      A. I'm not -- I'm not certain if it's currently

         18   maintained.

         19      Q. Was it at one point maintained by the Rotary

         20   Club of Houston?

         21      A. I believe so.

         22      Q. Okay.  If we turn to the third page, there's

         23   some bold type sort of in the top third of the

         24   page?

         25      A. Uh-huh.




                                                                       53



          1      Q. And it says, "When Marie Lombardi granted us

          2   permission to use her late husband's name, she

          3   gave us one charge:  To raise funds for the sole

          4   benefit of the American Cancer Society.  We've

          5   consistently delivered on that charge, raising

          6   millions in the process."

          7         Do you see that?

          8      A. Uh-huh, I do.

          9      Q. Did I read that correctly?

         10      A. Yeah.

         11      Q. And do you believe that website to be

         12   referencing the telegram permission?

         13      A. It's likely that it does.

         14      Q. Do you believe it accurately reflects the

         15   permission that she granted?

         16      A. It's not the same wording.  So it's an

         17   interpretation, I believe, of what she said.

         18      Q. Okay.  Do you -- do you think it's

         19   inaccurate?

         20      A. Not necessarily.

         21      Q. Do you see up at the top right right above

         22   that language, it has November 2006, and then it's

         23   kind of gray, December 12, 2007, and then sort of

         24   like a bold January 2008?

         25      A. Uh-huh.




                                                                       54



          1      Q. Do you -- do you know what that means?

          2      A. I would assume that the date of this

          3   document is December 12, 2007.

          4      Q. Okay.  Thank you.  Do you know why as late

          5   as 2007 the Rotary Club would still be referencing

          6   permission from Mrs. Lombardi?

          7      A. I read this as public relations script, not

          8   necessarily as a -- as a hard policy statement by

          9   the leadership of the Club or the membership of

         10   the Club.

         11      Q. What would be the difference?

         12      A. Well, my -- my interface with -- with what

         13   I've just said in my own life is that you hire

         14   somebody to write copy for you to put out a

         15   publication or to put out a notice and make it

         16   interesting, make it powerful, give some -- you

         17   know, people that write copy for a living are good

         18   at conveying things.  So that's kind of how I read

         19   this.

         20      Q. But in your opinion is it still a

         21   communication to the public about the permission

         22   that's been granted to the Club?

         23      A. The word "permission" is used here.  It

         24   says, "...permission to use her late husband's

         25   name."




                                                                       55



          1      Q. Okay.  I'm going to hand you what we will

          2   mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 8.

          3                  (Exhibit 8 marked.)

          4      A. Okay.

          5      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen this document

          6   before?

          7      A. Not that I recall.

          8      Q. Okay.  At the top in handwriting, it appears

          9   to be the name of a Mrs. Vicki Brentin.  Do you

         10   know Mrs. Brentin?

         11      A. I'm familiar with her, but I do not know her

         12   very well.

         13      Q. How are you familiar with her?

         14      A. Just from a couple of different Rotary

         15   events, meeting her and saying hello.

         16      Q. Is she a member of the Rotary Club of

         17   Houston?

         18      A. I don't think she currently is.

         19      Q. Was she at some point while you were a

         20   member?

         21      A. No, I don't think she was a member while I

         22   was a member.

         23      Q. Do you know if she was ever a president of

         24   the Club?

         25      A. That's easy to verify.  I don't know for




                                                                       56



          1   sure.  I think maybe she was.

          2      Q. Okay.

          3      A. Again, I'm speculating.

          4      Q. So what -- did she attend a meeting that you

          5   were at or -- I'm trying to get the context of --

          6      A. Not that I recall.

          7      Q. Okay.  But you know who she is or you've met

          8   her?

          9      A. Yes.

         10      Q. Okay.  In the first paragraph of this

         11   document, it says, "RLA committee in dire need of

         12   'revitalization,' needs energy and more depth for

         13   leadership."

         14      A. Okay.

         15      Q. Was that ever a concern during your tenure

         16   for the Club with regard to the Lombardi Award?

         17      A. You know, in general this is the sort of

         18   thing that gets talked about every year in every

         19   aspect of Rotary.  So do I -- am I aware of there

         20   being a dire need for revitalization?  No, I

         21   wouldn't put it that way from my own point of

         22   view.  And candidly I don't even know who wrote

         23   this --

         24      Q. Sure.

         25      A. -- or where it comes from.  These could have




                                                                       57



          1   been topics discussed 20 years ago or last month.

          2      Q. Were there discussions while you were on the

          3   committee about needs for revitalization?

          4      A. Not specifically.  Every year brings people

          5   that have enthusiasm and new ideas that -- if

          6   they're new to Rotary, they -- they feel that they

          7   can do something to help deal with issues they see

          8   as Rotary having too much of or not enough of.

          9   They sit and work with people that have been in

         10   those situations -- not just the Lombardi Award,

         11   but any situation -- that have been doing it that

         12   way for 20 years, and it works.  The Rotary

         13   constantly deals -- and I mean Rotary

         14   International constantly deals with the confluence

         15   of new ideas and doing things that work as -- as a

         16   historical precedent.  It's part of what makes

         17   Rotary a great organization, and it also generates

         18   a lot of letters of opinion that come out of

         19   nowhere.

         20      Q. As the representative of Rotary, are you

         21   aware of things that the Rotary Club of Houston

         22   could have done to improve the award?

         23      A. I think every single person out there would

         24   have an opinion about how things could be done

         25   differently, done better, do more of this, not as




                                                                       58



          1   much of that.  But this is -- this is a process of

          2   people working on ideas together year over year.

          3   Whether it's -- whether it's the Lombardi Award,

          4   whether it's the DCA, whether it's how to get more

          5   books into the hands of kids in Houston schools,

          6   everybody has got an idea of how to make things

          7   better.  And they have an idea of what doesn't

          8   work and what should be tried next.

          9      Q. Well, were specific ideas for improving the

         10   award or the ceremony or the process discussed?

         11      A. Can you give me something to anchor that to?

         12   Discussed when?  Discussed where?  Discussed --

         13      Q. Okay.  So during your tenure on the

         14   committee, were there problems or challenges with

         15   the event discussed?

         16      A. When I was involved, there were discussions

         17   about, "How can we raise more money?  What can we

         18   do better?  What shouldn't we do any more of?"

         19   There were traditions in the award that were

         20   attractive to people, as I understood, that, you

         21   know, you do certain things in certain ways, and

         22   that's attractive.  There were people that wanted

         23   to do a bigger dinner.  There were people that

         24   didn't want to do dinner at all.

         25         So, I mean, basically -- and that's -- and




                                                                       59



          1   to me that's how Rotary operates.  Every -- every

          2   year people talk about how to make the event

          3   bigger, better.  They bring their own preferences

          4   and experiences.  They compare it to other things

          5   that are done.

          6         Other people will say, "This is how we've

          7   always done it, and it works really well.  And you

          8   can't criticize it.  It raised $300,000 one year,"

          9   you know, that kind of stuff.  So it's just part

         10   of the context of being in a volunteer

         11   organization that embraces people to participate.

         12      Q. So the process is sort of inconsistent from

         13   year to year?

         14      A. I wouldn't say that.

         15      Q. Okay.  But what would be consistent about

         16   what you just described?

         17      A. That people come together and get consensus

         18   understood, and then people -- so it's -- it's

         19   like a family discussion.  Everybody wants

         20   something different.  But when you agree on what

         21   you're going to do, people lean in and do it.

         22      Q. But this deliberation process takes place

         23   sort of year after year after year in terms of

         24   what we're going to do, how we're going to do it?

         25      A. It can, but I don't think that's deleterious




                                                                       60



          1   to the effort.  I think that's what engages

          2   people.

          3      Q. But does the effort change from year to

          4   year?

          5      A. It can move back and forth a little bit.

          6   The last event was -- was different in some ways

          7   from previous events because it did not involve a

          8   meal and it took place in an auditorium rather

          9   than a ballroom.  So, I mean, the -- the --

         10   there's -- there's a willingness to try new things

         11   and innovate and improve and advance the award,

         12   as -- the same thing with Distinguished Citizen or

         13   with the Veterans Day Lunch.

         14         You know, just for context, I'm in charge of

         15   it this year.  I was president over it last year.

         16   We have a number of the same people helping out

         17   again this year that want to do things the way

         18   they used to do, and there's people that want to

         19   do things differently.  You find ways to

         20   incorporate those issues so that enthusiasm is

         21   maintained and people get engaged.

         22      Q. Is there a different chair of the Lombardi

         23   Committee every year?

         24      A. Yes.

         25      Q. And that different chair, they have their




                                                                       61



          1   own vision of sort of how the event should

          2   proceed?

          3      A. I think that's too polarizing to say that.

          4      Q. Did you have your own vision of how the

          5   event should proceed when you were chair?

          6      A. I had enthusiasm for -- I was never chair of

          7   the event.  Did you just ask me that?

          8      Q. I think I did, yes.

          9      A. No, I was never chair of the event.

         10      Q. You were chair of the committee, the

         11   Lombardi Committee?

         12      A. I was never chair of the Lombardi Committee.

         13      Q. What was your role with regard to the

         14   committee?

         15      A. I was just a participant in the committee.

         16      Q. You were a member of the committee?

         17      A. Yes.

         18      Q. Excuse me.  So while you were a member of

         19   the committee, were you aware that the chair had

         20   their own vision of sort of how the event should

         21   proceed?

         22      A. I think that everybody had preferences for

         23   how they would change it, how they would grow it,

         24   but I don't want to -- I don't want to

         25   substantiate your question, if it's being asked in




                                                                       62



          1   the context of, "Was it different every year?  Was

          2   it reimagined every year?  Was" -- "was it" --

          3   "was there no consistency or congruity?"

          4         That was -- there was.  There was

          5   consistency.  There were -- there were congruous

          6   elements of that from one year to the next, if

          7   that's the right word.  People were interested in

          8   making it better, making it bigger, and -- and --

          9   and with enthusiasm.

         10      Q. In the year that you were involved, were

         11   there celebrity speakers?

         12      A. Yeah, there were.

         13      Q. Who was that?

         14      A. I'm trying to recall.  I think that -- gosh,

         15   that's all on record.  It's really hard for me to

         16   call up names.  I'm sorry.  But, yes, there were.

         17   There were some celebrity speakers.  And my

         18   understanding of their participation was they were

         19   secured by Axiom for that event.

         20      Q. Was there national broadcast coverage of the

         21   event?

         22      A. I don't think there was.

         23      Q. Were there guidelines for the members of the

         24   committee on how to run the event?

         25      A. Not that I'm aware of.




                                                                       63



          1      Q. Before you became a member of Rotary in

          2   2013, were you aware of the award?

          3      A. No, because I had just moved to Houston.  I

          4   moved to Houston in the summer of 2012.

          5      Q. So you didn't -- it was -- your exposure to

          6   the award was when you became a member?

          7      A. Yes.

          8      Q. Okay.  Was it -- when you were part of the

          9   committee -- when you were a member on the

         10   committee, was there any discussion about inviting

         11   the Lombardis to the event?

         12      A. I don't specifically recall.

         13      Q. Do you think they should have been invited

         14   to the event?

         15      A. I can't say that they weren't.

         16      Q. Okay.  But let's say -- let's say -- let's

         17   say they weren't.  I'm not saying that that's your

         18   testimony.  Do you think they -- do you think they

         19   should be there?

         20              MR. GARVIN:  Objection.  That's a

         21   different question.

         22              MR. TODD:  Okay.  I'll restate it.

         23      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Regardless of whether or not

         24   they were invited, do you think the Lombardis have

         25   a place at this event?  Do you think they have a




                                                                       64



          1   role to play in this event?

          2      A. My impression was that there was a standing

          3   invitation for anybody in the Lombardi family to

          4   attend the event.

          5      Q. Do you know if the Club made any attempt to

          6   coordinate their attendance?

          7      A. I believe those attempts were made and

          8   that -- that people reached out.

          9      Q. Why do you believe that?

         10      A. Because it was talked about, like, "Who's

         11   coming from the Lombardi family this year?  Who's

         12   going to attend?"

         13      Q. So do you remember any more about that, like

         14   what kinds of invitations were extended or who --

         15   who might be attending from the family?

         16      A. I don't.  I mean, my -- my -- looking back

         17   on it, my -- my view of that was that people with

         18   a much longer history than mine involved in the

         19   award were also involved in those matters.

         20   Certainly there was -- I never heard a single word

         21   of exclusionary intent towards anybody in the

         22   Lombardi family.

         23      Q. Do you think -- in your opinion if the

         24   Lombardis had wanted something changed about the

         25   award, do you think Rotary would have responded to




                                                                       65



          1   that?

          2      A. I think there would have been dialogue about

          3   it, yes, just -- we're all about dialogue.

          4      Q. Sure.  Do you feel like the Lombardis have a

          5   say in how this should -- this event should be

          6   carried out?

          7      A. I think that in proper context Rotary would

          8   embrace their input, but the name is separate from

          9   the award in my opinion.  The Rotary Lombardi

         10   Award is something that the Rotary Club built and

         11   did its best to advance every year, and the

         12   relationship with the Lombardi family was always a

         13   big element of that.  So, you know, if you're --

         14   if there's a relationship, you respect what goes

         15   back and forth in that relationship.

         16      Q. Is it Rotary's duty to protect the legacy of

         17   Vince Lombardi?

         18      A. I really don't think I understand that

         19   question.  I don't think I've said anything that

         20   creates a context of duty, per se.  So --

         21      Q. Well, Vince Lombardi certainly has a public

         22   persona, an image.  Would you agree with that?

         23      A. The name does, yes.

         24      Q. The legacy of Mr. -- of Coach Lombardi.

         25      A. Uh-huh.




                                                                       66



          1      Q. Does Rotary have an obligation to uphold

          2   the dignity of that image?

          3      A. I'm struggling with your question, to be

          4   candid with you.  I'm trying to -- I'm trying to

          5   think about what I know about Rotary and how

          6   Rotary operates, the good that we do in the world,

          7   somehow being held up against an interpretation of

          8   duty or obligation.  I'm not sure that -- that's

          9   just tough for me.

         10         Rotary does a lot of good things in the

         11   world.  And I don't feel like I have to sit here

         12   and defend Rotary, but -- but, you know, any --

         13   any kind of an assertion that Rotary is not doing

         14   right by something is difficult for me.

         15      Q. The implication here is that the Rotary Club

         16   of Houston has some kind of permanent right to use

         17   the Lombardi name.  At least that's what's sort of

         18   being debated as part of this dispute.  And what

         19   I'm getting at is if that's the case, can Rotary

         20   just do whatever they want with the Lombardi name?

         21      A. And -- and my answer is I think that's an

         22   irrelevant question, because Rotary is not going

         23   to do whatever it wants to the -- to the detriment

         24   of -- of something that it's built over 47 years.

         25      Q. That's an assumption or an interpretation,




                                                                       67



          1   correct?

          2      A. That's my view.

          3      Q. Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to hand you what we

          4   will mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 9.

          5                  (Exhibit 9 marked.)

          6      A. Okay.

          7      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen this document

          8   before?

          9      A. I believe I have.

         10      Q. Do you recall in what context?

         11      A. Well, in the context of John Lombardi

         12   wanting to end the Lombardi family's relationship

         13   with Rotary.

         14      Q. Did you -- did you receive this letter from

         15   Mr. Lombardi?

         16      A. I may have, but I can't say for certain that

         17   I did.  I believe I've seen it, but I don't think

         18   I would have automatically been on a copy list for

         19   this, depending on how it's delivered.

         20      Q. While you were a member of the committee,

         21   did you -- did you understand Mr. John Lombardi to

         22   be the representative of the Lombardi family?

         23      A. Not necessarily.

         24      Q. Who did you understand that representative

         25   to be?




                                                                       68



          1      A. I don't think I understood that there was a

          2   single representative of the overall family.

          3      Q. Do you know who Mr. John Lombardi is?

          4      A. Not specifically in regards to where his --

          5   you know, I don't know who he's the son or

          6   grandson of, et cetera.  I understand he's a

          7   member of the Lombardi family.

          8      Q. Is there any reason why you would think he

          9   would not have the authority to issue this letter?

         10      A. I'm not aware of any sort of organizational

         11   structure within the Lombardi family.  I come from

         12   a big family, and I'm just here to tell you that

         13   everybody tends to speak for themselves.  So if

         14   there's some sort of document or something that

         15   establishes that John Lombardi is the spokesman

         16   for the Lombardi family, I'd be glad to look at

         17   that, but honestly I don't really know.

         18      Q. Did anybody tell you he was not the

         19   spokesman for the family?

         20      A. When this came out, there was a lot of

         21   discussion about whether he was in authority to do

         22   that, to make -- to write the letter and speak for

         23   the family.

         24      Q. What was the nature of that discussion?

         25   What kinds of discussions were they?




                                                                       69



          1      A. Very -- very multiperson, lots of different

          2   opinions.  You know, there's -- there's people in

          3   this -- in the Rotary organization that have known

          4   various Lombardis for many, many years.  So some

          5   people immediately said, "Well, he doesn't have

          6   the right to speak for the whole family."

          7      Q. So who would those people be?

          8      A. I have no idea.

          9      Q. Did they say it to you?

         10      A. People have been mentioned, like Steve

         11   Warner, for example -- or Werner -- were mentioned

         12   as having an equal opinion.  I just don't know

         13   the -- the Lombardi family tree and all the people

         14   that are associated with it.  It's really outside

         15   my direct experience.

         16      Q. Certainly.  I understand that.  But you're

         17   talking about -- you sort of have raised the issue

         18   of there being debate and discussion around, you

         19   know, whether or not Mr. Lombardi had the

         20   authority.  And I'm just trying to get to the

         21   bottom of who was saying what.

         22      A. There are other people that could tell you

         23   more directly than I.

         24      Q. Who would that be?

         25      A. Rick Olsen, for one.




                                                                       70



          1      Q. Okay.  Anybody else?

          2      A. In my view Rick probably has the best -- the

          3   best grip on that.

          4      Q. So were there also people saying that

          5   Mr. Lombardi did have the authority?

          6      A. No.  This -- what I'm aware of in the

          7   context of what we're talking about proximate to

          8   this letter is that the discussions were that --

          9   that -- that nobody really had the authority to

         10   speak for the entire family unless they could

         11   demonstrate they had that authority and that there

         12   was a lot of discussion that other people in the

         13   overall family may not and probably did not agree

         14   with this.

         15      Q. What does "a lot of discussion" mean?  Does

         16   that mean formal agenda items at meetings, or does

         17   that mean --

         18      A. No.

         19      Q. -- in the hallway or --

         20      A. Yeah.  Sorry I cut you off.

         21      Q. It's okay.  Go ahead.  I'm done.

         22      A. No, just I was aware that people were

         23   talking about it.

         24      Q. How did you feel about it?

         25      A. I'm fairly new to this.  You know, I saw




                                                                       71



          1   this as -- as a member of the Lombardi family

          2   saying that they wanted to end the relationship

          3   with Rotary.

          4      Q. What if Vince Lombardi, Jr., had written

          5   this letter, the son of Vince Lombardi?

          6      A. I have no idea.

          7      Q. Would that make a difference to you?

          8      A. I really don't know.

          9      Q. Do you think Vince Lombardi, Jr., has the

         10   authority to speak for the family?

         11      A. My view of this is that the Lombardi Award

         12   and the relationship with the family are two

         13   different things.

         14      Q. How so?

         15      A. We got permission to use the name.  We built

         16   a nationally recognized award year over year over

         17   year.  And that's -- that's a separate estate.

         18      Q. And if they're not happy with it, it's just

         19   tough?

         20      A. No, don't put those words in my mouth.

         21      Q. Okay.  So what happens when they're not

         22   happy with it?

         23      A. With -- well, you have to define "they,"

         24   don't you?  Because the fact of the matter is,

         25   this is one Lombardi.




                                                                       72



          1      Q. What happens when any Lombardi family member

          2   is not happy with it?

          3      A. We offer to get together and talk, just like

          4   we did with him.

          5      Q. Did you, in fact, get together and talk?

          6      A. I did not.

          7      Q. Did the Rotary Club of Houston?

          8      A. I think -- I think there were dialogues with

          9   him, I believe, but I don't know that for sure.

         10      Q. Does it make a difference to you if the sole

         11   surviving heir of Coach Lombardi writes this

         12   letter and says, "I'm not happy, and I'm ending

         13   this relationship"?  Does that make any difference

         14   to you?

         15              MR. GARVIN:  Objection, assumes facts

         16   not in evidence.  You can answer.

         17      A. There are mitigating circumstances to this

         18   letter that -- that affect my view of it.

         19      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Like what?

         20      A. I believe that John Lombardi was massively

         21   manipulated by Rick Slemaker.

         22      Q. Why?

         23      A. To destroy the relationship between the

         24   Lombardi family or John Lombardi and the Rotary

         25   Club of Houston.




                                                                       73



          1      Q. What do you base that on?

          2      A. That's just how I feel about it.

          3      Q. Do you have any facts that would indicate

          4   that that was the case?

          5      A. I had a number of discussions with Rick

          6   Slemaker to that effect.

          7      Q. To what effect?

          8      A. What I just said, that basically I feel -- I

          9   feel that he did what he could do to get between

         10   the Lombardi family and the Rotary Club of Houston

         11   to precipitate this letter and set up the Lombardi

         12   Foundation in an attempt to take the Lombardi

         13   Award and go his own way with it.

         14      Q. And you discussed this with him?

         15      A. I did.

         16      Q. Can you be more specific about the content

         17   of those discussions?

         18      A. Just speaking in generalities -- I don't

         19   have dates.  I don't have times.  I don't have

         20   transcripts of that.  But on two different

         21   occasions, Rick Slemaker told me that the

         22   Rotary -- the Rotary Lombardi Award was his.

         23      Q. Was this before or after you joined the

         24   Foundation?

         25      A. Pardon me.




                                                                       74



          1      Q. Was this conversation before or after you

          2   joined the Foundation?

          3      A. I joined the Foundation?  What do you mean

          4   by that?

          5      Q. You attended a meeting, and then you

          6   resigned.

          7      A. Oh, the Lombardi Foundation?

          8      Q. Correct.  Excuse me.  The Lombardi

          9   Foundation.  Was it before or after you joined the

         10   Lombardi Foundation, this conversation?

         11      A. This was all concurrent with that situation.

         12      Q. "That situation" being your being a member

         13   of the Lombardi Foundation?

         14      A. The situation with Slemaker.

         15      Q. So was the situation with Slemaker

         16   concurrent with your membership in the Lombardi

         17   Foundation?

         18      A. I didn't really view myself as a member of

         19   it until I participated in the first meeting, and

         20   then I resigned immediately.  Leading up to that,

         21   you know, we were in the middle of Hurricane

         22   Harvey.  There were a lot of things going on.  And

         23   a number of people in Rotary were interested in

         24   salvaging the relationship with John Lombardi at

         25   that time.




                                                                       75



          1      Q. I'm just trying to put the conversations in

          2   order with regard to what happened in time.  So,

          3   you know, were these conversations with

          4   Mr. Slemaker before you resigned?

          5      A. Yes.

          6      Q. Were they before you attended the first

          7   meeting?

          8      A. Yes.

          9      Q. What was Mr. Slemaker's vision for the award

         10   that you recall?

         11      A. My impression of his vision for the award

         12   was to make it similar to the Heisman.

         13      Q. Was that Rotary's vision for the award?

         14      A. Not in the same context, not in the same

         15   scale, not the same way.

         16      Q. What was Rotary's vision for the award?

         17      A. To advance the award, as they had been doing

         18   for 47 years, find ways to make it more

         19   prestigious, grow it, have it become a -- a -- an

         20   increasingly more valuable tool for doing good

         21   in the world through funding cancer research.

         22      Q. How is it different from Mr. Slemaker's

         23   vision from the award -- for the award?  Excuse

         24   me.

         25      A. I never heard anybody in Rotary say the




                                                                       76



          1   award was personally theirs.

          2      Q. Okay.  But we're talking about the vision

          3   for the award in terms of what it's going to

          4   accomplish, what it should represent, how it

          5   should be viewed in the community, was it being

          6   used to raise money for cancer research.  That's

          7   what I'm talking about.  So was there a difference

          8   between Rotary's vision and Mr. Slemaker's vision

          9   in those respects?

         10      A. Yeah, I believe there was.

         11      Q. Okay.  How was -- what were the differences

         12   in your opinion?

         13      A. It's a difficult question to answer.  I

         14   think that Rotary's -- Rotary's intention has

         15   always been with the Rotary Lombardi Award to

         16   advance the award, make it a prestigious event,

         17   use it for fundraising, innovate, improve, and

         18   increase it along the way, as they've done for all

         19   of these years.  And my view of what Rick Slemaker

         20   personally wanted to do with the award was to own

         21   it.

         22      Q. What does -- what does that mean?

         23      A. To be the executor of it, to be the

         24   controller of it, to be the vendor of it.

         25      Q. Is there any indication that the Lombardi




                                                                       77



          1   Foundation did not want to raise money for cancer?

          2      A. It's hard for me to speak to that, having

          3   only attended one meeting.

          4      Q. Did they ever say anything like that in that

          5   meeting?

          6      A. Like what?

          7      Q. That they didn't want to raise money for

          8   cancer?

          9      A. No.

         10      Q. Did they say what they did want to do?

         11      A. Basically raise money for cancer.

         12      Q. Okay.  And you said that Mr. Slemaker saw

         13   the Lombardi Award as maybe a potential competitor

         14   or similar to the Heisman Award.  Is that correct?

         15   Can you --

         16      A. To have equal status.

         17      Q. Equal status as the Heisman Award.  Was that

         18   Rotary Club of Houston's goal?

         19      A. We're talking cats and dogs differences

         20   here.  The -- the -- advancing an award,

         21   increasing its prestige, having it be year over

         22   year beneficial to cancer research and so on is --

         23   you don't know what you don't know.  I don't know

         24   what I don't know.  But I'm just telling you from

         25   me the difference of having this award be being at




                                                                       78



          1   its base somebody's personal property and having

          2   ideas for the award and so on be driven by ego at

          3   a singular personal level after it being a product

          4   and something that evolved with the Rotary Club of

          5   Houston for 47 years, it's hard for me to talk

          6   about those two things as though they're on the

          7   same set of railroad tracks.  That's really what

          8   this is about.

          9      Q. This bit about sort of your -- your opinion

         10   about Mr. Slemaker's vision for the -- for the

         11   award being driven by his singular personal

         12   purposes, do you -- do you have any facts to

         13   substantiate that?

         14      A. Just discussions with him.

         15      Q. And he -- and he told you that?

         16      A. He said, "The Rotary" -- he said, "The

         17   Rotary Lombardi Award is mine."

         18      Q. In what context was that?

         19      A. The context of trying to work on the award

         20   as a committee, trying to have Rotary advance its

         21   involvement in the award, have Rotary give the

         22   award next year.

         23      Q. Was he chair of the committee at that time?

         24      A. No.

         25      Q. No?  When was this?




                                                                       79



          1      A. This was in Rick's Olsen's year.  Graham

          2   Sharp was chair of the committee at that time.

          3      Q. When Mr. Slemaker was chair of the

          4   committee, were you aware that he was prevented

          5   from doing anything that he wanted to do with

          6   regard to promotion of the award?

          7      A. When Rick Slemaker was chair?

          8      Q. Uh-huh.

          9      A. So I was on the committee when Rick Slemaker

         10   was president of the Club.  I'm not sure --

         11   honestly I don't recall who was the chair of the

         12   committee at that time.  It might have been

         13   Billy Bray.

         14      Q. Did you ever hear Mr. Slemaker talk about

         15   things that he wanted to do with the award that he

         16   could not do with -- at Rotary?

         17      A. No.

         18      Q. Does Rotary have any agreements with any

         19   other individuals regarding the use of their name?

         20   And by that I mean the Rotary Club of Houston.

         21      A. Not that I'm aware of.

         22                  (Exhibit 10 marked.)

         23      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  I'm going to hand you

         24   deposition Exhibit No. 10.

         25      A. Okay.




                                                                       80



          1      Q. Have you seen this document before?

          2      A. Yes, I have.

          3      Q. In what context?

          4      A. When it happened, so with Rick as president

          5   and efforts being made to see if there was way to

          6   continue a relationship with the family.

          7      Q. Did you help prepare this letter?

          8      A. I did not.

          9      Q. Did you see a draft of this letter before it

         10   went out?

         11      A. Not that I recall.

         12      Q. Okay.  At the time Mr. Olsen was president

         13   of the Rotary Club of Houston, correct?

         14      A. Yes.

         15      Q. Okay.  So in the first paragraph, Mr. Olsen

         16   says, "I write in response to your letter

         17   addressed to the Board of Directors of the Rotary

         18   Club of Houston on August 5, 2017.  Specifically,

         19   your decision to end the historic relationship

         20   between the Lombardi family and the Rotary Club of

         21   Houston without any explanation."

         22         Did I read that correctly?

         23      A. Uh-huh.

         24      Q. Okay.  Do you interpret that as an

         25   acknowledgment by Mr. Olsen that the relationship




                                                                       81



          1   had terminated?

          2      A. I read it as a response to John Lombardi's

          3   letter.  Again, whether that -- whether any of

          4   this closes the loop and creates a certainty that

          5   Rotary's relationship with anybody in the -- and

          6   everybody in the Lombardi family is hereby

          7   terminated I think is -- I don't think I can say

          8   that.

          9      Q. So this letter was sent in August of 2017.

         10   When would the next Rotary Lombardi Award have

         11   taken place?

         12      A. Oh, gosh, I'm trying to remember.  I believe

         13   it would have taken place early in the year of

         14   2018.

         15      Q. Okay.  Did it take place?

         16      A. No.

         17      Q. Was there a Rotary Lombardi award in 2019?

         18      A. No.

         19      Q. Okay.  Why not?

         20      A. Because of all of this.

         21      Q. Because the relationship was terminated?

         22      A. No, it's because -- it's because of this

         23   controversy, because of the issues.  It's just

         24   extremely confusing to have two Rotary Clubs

         25   presenting two Lombardi Awards in the same




                                                                       82



          1   community, especially in the context of the fact

          2   that a newly formed club was involved in and

          3   claimed it was now going to take the Lombardi

          4   award forward and so on.  There's a lot of -- just

          5   a lot of confusion in the air within the world of

          6   Rotary, as limited to Houston anyway.  And I don't

          7   think anybody thought that trying to have two

          8   awards was in the best interest of what we saw as

          9   our intellectual property -- what we see as our

         10   intellectual property.

         11      Q. Was there -- was there confusion about your

         12   authority to be able to give the award?

         13      A. Not in my opinion.

         14      Q. Was there confusion at Rotary about Rotary's

         15   authority to give the award?

         16      A. I don't think so.

         17      Q. So why wouldn't they proceed?

         18              MR. GARVIN:  Objection, asked and

         19   answered.  You can answer it once again.

         20      A. The issue here is that an award that we

         21   developed was represented as having gone somewhere

         22   else, and that's patently not how we see it.

         23   Presenting the award just is a very, very

         24   difficult situation given all of these things that

         25   were going on in the context of Rotary Clubs, and




                                                                       83



          1   it's hard to do.  Don't confuse the fact that we

          2   didn't do a presentation with any doubts

          3   whatsoever that we own the Lombardi Award.  That's

          4   not the case.

          5      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Did Mr. Olsen say that to the

          6   Lombardi family?

          7      A. I have no idea.

          8      Q. To your knowledge has -- has anybody from

          9   the Rotary Club of Houston communicated to the

         10   Lombardi family that the Rotary Club of Houston

         11   owns the Lombardi Award?

         12      A. I have no idea.  I feel that we own it.

         13      Q. In the last paragraph Mr. Olsen says, "If

         14   your decision to now end the long-standing and

         15   valued relationship between the Lombardi family

         16   and the Rotary Club of Houston is somehow

         17   predicated upon the termination of the Axiom

         18   contract, I respectfully request that you

         19   reconsider the underlying facts."

         20      A. That's what it says.

         21      Q. All right.  Well, would you agree that

         22   Mr. Olsen here somehow views Mr. John Lombardi as

         23   somebody that has the power to end the

         24   relationship?

         25      A. I think he's talking to John Lombardi in the




                                                                       84



          1   context of John's letter.

          2      Q. John's letter terminating the relationship?

          3      A. Right.

          4              MR. GARVIN:  Hey, why don't we take

          5   five?  It's been about an hour, and nature is

          6   calling me.

          7              MR. TODD:  Yeah, that's fine.  Yeah,

          8   sure.

          9                        (Recess.)

         10      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  I'm going to hand you

         11   what we will mark as Deposition Exhibit No. 11.

         12                  (Exhibit 11 marked.)

         13      A. Okay.

         14      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Do you remember -- do you --

         15   do you -- have you seen this before?

         16      A. Yes, yes.

         17      Q. Okay.  Just as a recipient?  Or did you help

         18   draft it or --

         19      A. I did not help draft it.

         20      Q. Okay.  Did you just receive it as a member

         21   of the Club?

         22      A. Yes, I did.

         23      Q. Okay.  And the first paragraph there says --

         24   well, let me back that up.  Do you understand this

         25   to be a press release from the Rotary Club of




                                                                       85



          1   Houston?

          2      A. Yes.

          3      Q. Okay.  And in the first sentence there, it

          4   says, "Representatives of the Lombardi family have

          5   elected to end the historic and long-standing

          6   relationship with the Rotary Club of Houston.

          7   Consequently, the Rotary Club of Houston will not

          8   present the 48th Annual Rotary Lombardi Award for

          9   the 2017-2018 College Football Season as

         10   previously announced."

         11         Did I read that correctly?

         12      A. Yes.

         13      Q. Okay.  So the first sentence here says that

         14   the representatives of the Lombardi family have

         15   elected to end the historic relationship, and

         16   consequently the Rotary Club of Houston will not

         17   present the award.  So would you understand that

         18   to be an acceptance of their termination if you're

         19   consequently not presenting the award?

         20              MR. GARVIN:  Objection, misstates the

         21   document.  You may answer.

         22      A. Yeah.  No, I don't specifically understand

         23   it that way.

         24      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  How do you understand

         25   it?




                                                                       86



          1      A. We were dealing with a lot of chaos.  We had

          2   Hurricane Harvey, lots of things going on.  The --

          3   the relationship with the Lombardi family was

          4   something that mattered to everybody.  I don't

          5   think anybody felt like they had the right to take

          6   the ownership of the award away from us, but the

          7   relationship with the family was -- was

          8   consequential to people's hearts and minds.

          9      Q. So the relationship with the Lombardi family

         10   was important to the Rotary Club of Houston?

         11      A. How could it not be?

         12      Q. What efforts did the Rotary Club of Houston

         13   make to repair this relationship?

         14      A. Well, Rick Olsen led -- I guess as president

         15   he led an effort in that regard, and I'm aware

         16   that other people within the Club that have

         17   relationships with people in the Lombardi family

         18   reached out as well.

         19      Q. So can we be more specific than that in

         20   terms of --

         21      A. Joe Colangelo is someone who was involved in

         22   some discussions, I believe, with other members of

         23   the Lombardi family.

         24      Q. Do you know which members?

         25      A. No, I don't.




                                                                       87



          1      Q. Anyone else?

          2      A. Not that I'm specifically aware of.

          3      Q. So the people that would have reached out to

          4   the Lombardi family would be, to your knowledge,

          5   Rick Olsen and Joe Colangelo?

          6      A. That I know for certain did reach out, yes.

          7      Q. Okay.  But you don't know who to

          8   specifically?

          9      A. No, I specifically don't.

         10      Q. Okay.  Was there discussion at the -- any

         11   meeting of the Club about additional efforts to

         12   try to repair the relationship with the family?

         13      A. I'm trying to specifically recall.  I know

         14   there were discussions.  I don't know if they were

         15   held at official club meetings or whether they

         16   were just held between members.

         17      Q. There was no agenda item at a meeting, for

         18   example, that says, "Hey, we need to appoint a

         19   person to reach out to the Lombardis and repair

         20   this relationship"?

         21      A. Not that I'm aware of.

         22      Q. Okay.

         23      A. I don't think a specific person would have

         24   been appointed, candidly, because everybody

         25   felt -- if people feel like they have a




                                                                       88



          1   relationship with somebody, they're just going to

          2   go ahead and call.

          3      Q. So Mr. Olsen and Mr. Colangelo weren't

          4   appointed to go do this.  They took it upon

          5   themselves to go do it?

          6      A. Well, I think it was incumbent on

          7   Rick Olsen --

          8      Q. Because he was the president?

          9      A. -- as the president.

         10      Q. And Mr. Colangelo volunteered to do it?

         11      A. Not in any organized predetermined

         12   permission-seeking way.

         13      Q. Okay.  Is it important to the Rotary Club of

         14   Houston to have a relationship with the family

         15   today?

         16      A. Certainly.

         17      Q. Have there been any efforts made to repair

         18   that relationship?

         19      A. That I'm specifically aware of, no.

         20                  (Exhibit 12 marked.)

         21      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Okay.  We've handed you what

         22   we've marked as Deposition Exhibit No. 12.  Can

         23   you just take a few moments to review it, please?

         24      A. Would you allow me to look at my phone real

         25   quick?  My wife is traveling.  It seems like my




                                                                       89



          1   phone is --

          2      Q. Sure.  We can go off the record for a

          3   second.

          4                   (Off the record.)

          5      A. Okay.

          6      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  All right.  Have you seen

          7   this document before?

          8      A. Yes.

          9      Q. In what context did you see this document?

         10      A. It was sent out to membership of the Rotary

         11   Club of Houston.

         12      Q. So you received it just as a recipient like

         13   anyone else?

         14      A. Yes.

         15      Q. Okay.  And on the last page this document

         16   appears to be signed by Mr. John Lombardi?

         17      A. It does.

         18      Q. Okay.  And it is written on Lombardi

         19   Foundation letterhead?

         20      A. It is.

         21      Q. Okay.  In reviewing this letter from a high

         22   level perspective, would you agree with me that it

         23   appears to be a summary of Mr. Lombardi's

         24   frustrations with the Rotary Club of Houston?

         25      A. Yes, it appears to be that.




                                                                       90



          1      Q. If we look at the bottom of the first

          2   paragraph on the first page, it says, "Instead of

          3   looking for solutions or a way to repair the

          4   breach, members of the Rotary Club of Houston have

          5   looked to assign blame, find fault with prior

          6   actions and hold on to legalistic interpretations

          7   of decisions made in good faith."

          8      A. I'm sorry.  Where is that?

          9      Q. The bottom of the first paragraph on Page 1.

         10      A. Oh, okay.  Sorry.

         11      Q. "Instead of looking for solutions," do you

         12   have any understanding of what Mr. Lombardi meant

         13   by that?

         14      A. No, no idea.

         15      Q. Okay.  In April of 2018, would this have

         16   been -- would this have been before or after

         17   Mr. Olsen would have perhaps reached out to

         18   Mr. Lombardi?

         19      A. I can't say.

         20      Q. The next paragraph says, "Let me be clear:

         21   The Rotary Club of Houston does not own the rights

         22   to use the name Lombardi.  It was granted

         23   stewardship status and this arrangement was

         24   neither permanent nor irrevocable."

         25      A. That's what it says.




                                                                       91



          1      Q. Uh-huh.  Do you believe that to be true?

          2      A. No.

          3      Q. Based on the telegram?

          4              MR. GARVIN:  I'm going to object, asked

          5   and answered.  You can answer it yet again.

          6      A. Based on the telegram and the continuity

          7   of -- of what the Rotary Club did with the award

          8   for all those years.  "Stewardship" is a new word.

          9   I hadn't seen that before.  And I hadn't seen

         10   anything that said that there was a -- a

         11   revocability established or a time frame

         12   established.  Clearly it's his opinion.

         13      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  In the one, two, three,

         14   four -- fifth paragraph down -- I guess I should

         15   say it's the third paragraph up from the bottom.

         16      A. Let's try that.

         17      Q. Okay.  It says, "The Rotary Club of Houston

         18   was never granted ownership of the Lombardi name.

         19   They were granted permission to use it at the

         20   family's discretion as long as they protected the

         21   brand and raised the money.  They did neither the

         22   final years."

         23         Do you disagree with Mr. Lombardi that the

         24   Rotary Club of Houston did indeed protect the

         25   brand.




                                                                       92



          1      A. I don't understand what he means by not

          2   protecting the brand.  I don't understand that at

          3   all.

          4      Q. What do you think he means by "the brand"?

          5      A. Well, I think he's talking about the Rotary

          6   Lombardi Award.

          7      Q. Do you think he's talking about his family's

          8   legacy?

          9      A. I don't know.  It's not clear.

         10      Q. Do you believe that the Lombardi name

         11   constitutes a brand?

         12      A. I honestly don't know how to answer that.

         13      Q. Can anyone use it?

         14      A. I don't know.

         15      Q. Can anyone use Rotary?

         16      A. In what context?

         17      Q. If -- in any context.  Can I create a Rotary

         18   award?

         19      A. I'm not sure honestly.

         20      Q. If the Lombardi family is unhappy with the

         21   way their name is being used, do they have the

         22   right to effect an outcome?

         23              MR. GARVIN:  Objection, asked and

         24   answered.  You can go again.

         25      A. I honestly don't know how to speak to that.




                                                                       93



          1   It's kind of beyond my -- my realm.

          2      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Well --

          3      A. It's very subjective.

          4      Q. Sure.  If there was -- if Rotary created an

          5   award in your name for your profession and they

          6   were awarding it to people and you gave them

          7   permission to do so and then you didn't like the

          8   outcome, what would you do?

          9      A. It depends on the situation, candidly, you

         10   know, if it -- if they -- somebody said, "Here's

         11   the Lawrence D. Meeks Award," for whatever.

         12   That's not what this is.

         13      Q. That's not what this is.  Is it similar?

         14      A. I'm not sure.

         15                 (Exhibit 13 marked.)

         16      A. Okay.

         17      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Mr. Meeks, do you know what

         18   this is?

         19      A. No, I don't.

         20      Q. Okay.  I will represent to you that it is a

         21   printout from the United States Patent and

         22   Trademark Office website of a record that -- of an

         23   application by the Rotary Club of Houston to

         24   register the mark "Lombardi Award."  This was

         25   filed July 30th of this year.




                                                                       94



          1      A. Okay.

          2      Q. Are you aware that the Rotary Club of

          3   Houston had filed this application?

          4      A. I know there was some discussion about it.

          5      Q. Was there a discussion about it in the -- in

          6   the Club or at the Foundation?

          7      A. I believe at both.

          8      Q. Was there a vote?

          9      A. I'm not aware.

         10      Q. Do you know who made the decision?

         11      A. Specifically, no.

         12      Q. Was there any -- was there any discussion

         13   about --

         14              MR. GARVIN:  I'm sorry.  My next

         15   objection will be verbal.

         16      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Was there any discussion

         17   about whether or not to file as the "Rotary

         18   Lombardi Award"?

         19      A. Nothing that I'm aware of.

         20      Q. Do you see a distinction between a Rotary

         21   Lombardi Award and a Lombardi Award?

         22      A. I have to say in this context I really

         23   don't.

         24      Q. In your recollection, how was it used over

         25   the years?  Was it --




                                                                       95



          1      A. How was what used?

          2      Q. The mark.  Was it used as Rotary Lombardi

          3   Award, or was it used as Lombardi Award?

          4      A. I've heard it referred to in both -- you

          5   know, in both ways.  So there's not a distinction

          6   in my mind.

          7      Q. You see no difference between the Rotary

          8   Lombardi Award and the Lombardi Award?

          9      A. No, not in the context of what we're talking

         10   about, no.

         11      Q. Okay.  Is the Rotary Club of Houston

         12   currently using the Lombardi Award trademark?

         13      A. I'm not sure what you mean, "using."

         14      Q. Is it on -- is it on advertising materials?

         15   Are they promoting an event?  I mean, are they

         16   currently using this in any commercial fashion?

         17      A. Not that I'm aware of.

         18      Q. Are there plans for a future event?

         19      A. There's -- there's a lot of discussion about

         20   what's going to happen when this trademark case is

         21   settled.

         22      Q. What would that be?

         23      A. It would be to put the event back on again

         24   and continue to look for ways to improve and

         25   enhance and advance it.




                                                                       96



          1      Q. Has there been any discussion about who

          2   would be in charge of that?

          3      A. Again, and I think throughout our discussion

          4   this morning, I've drawn a distinction between

          5   what the Rotary Club views this as.  It's not

          6   singular.  It's not owned by a particular person.

          7   It's not -- there's -- there's no specific

          8   champion that's going to rise to the top and take

          9   it forward.  This is -- this is something that the

         10   Club does as a club.

         11      Q. Well, that -- that answers my question.  I

         12   mean, what I was getting at is, is there currently

         13   someone that's in -- spearheading this effort

         14   inside the Club, a specific person?

         15      A. I think there are a lot of people that will

         16   want to once this is cleared up.

         17      Q. What would that be?

         18      A. Any number of people in the Club.

         19      Q. Rick Olsen?

         20      A. Perhaps.

         21      Q. Joe Colangelo?

         22      A. Perhaps.  I could say perhaps to half the

         23   membership.

         24      Q. Is the Rotary Lombardi Award domain name

         25   currently in use?  Do you know?




                                                                       97



          1      A. I have no idea.

          2      Q. Okay.  Do you know if there have been

          3   discussions with sponsors or potential donors or

          4   with the American Cancer Society or anyone about a

          5   future event?

          6      A. I'm not aware of them.

          7      Q. Okay.  Have you ever heard of the Rotary

          8   Lombardi Humanitarian Award?

          9      A. No, I haven't.

         10                 (Exhibit 14 marked.)

         11              MR. GARVIN:  While Mr. Meeks is

         12   reviewing this, this document doesn't have a

         13   document identification number.  Was it produced?

         14              MR. MULLARKEY:  Yes.  I'll explain that.

         15   Mike, I apologize.  This was printed after hours,

         16   and the printer had technical difficulties, me.

         17   So the only reason that the number is not on there

         18   is just the print function that I had did not have

         19   the numbers.  So I will send you an email that

         20   indicates the numbers on the document.

         21              MR. GARVIN:  That has the produced

         22   numbers?

         23              MR. MULLARKEY:  Yes.  It's like LOM 420

         24   something.  So I apologize.

         25              MR. GARVIN:  Yeah, because it's just not




                                                                       98



          1   immediately coming to mind.

          2              MR. MULLARKEY:  Sure.  It was certainly

          3   produced, and I'll send you that record when we

          4   get back to the office.

          5      A. Okay.

          6      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Mr. Meeks, this is a rather

          7   long email chain --

          8      A. Yeah.

          9      Q. -- some of which you were involved in, and

         10   some of which you were not.

         11      A. Right.

         12      Q. I presume that you've seen some of --

         13   portions of the communications that were directed

         14   to you and that you have not seen other portions

         15   that occurred later that were not directed to you?

         16      A. That's correct.

         17      Q. Okay.  So if we turn to the -- well, I

         18   miscounted.  One, two, three, four, five -- the

         19   sixth page.

         20      A. I think I got the wrong --

         21      Q. Go one back, I think.

         22      A. "As you stated"?

         23      Q. Yeah, that's it.  That's the page.

         24      A. Okay.

         25      Q. So the second paragraph up from the bottom




                                                                       99



          1   says, "Remember John Lombardi cancelled Lombardi's

          2   name support" -- are we together?

          3      A. I see it.

          4      Q. -- "on August 4th.  This has gone now a

          5   month since trying to get Rotary back in Lombardi

          6   as we must move on as I've had no communications

          7   or answer either way on my request except yours.

          8   The silence from Rotary is 'loud and clear' and

          9   the decision is made by Rotary's silence to move

         10   on without Rotary in the Lombardi Awards and

         11   Honors."

         12         Was he -- when he says "except yours," was

         13   he talking about your response, Mr. Meeks?

         14      A. I believe he was referring to my response

         15   when he said "yours."

         16      Q. Okay.  Do you recall what your response was?

         17      A. My email that's in here.

         18      Q. Okay.  And that would be the email that is

         19   farther back on roughly the -- that begins on

         20   Page 8?

         21      A. Yeah.

         22      Q. Okay.  And that email from you that begins

         23   on Page 8, also on Page 9, contains your

         24   resignation from the Lombardi Foundation, correct?

         25      A. That's right.




                                                                      100



          1      Q. Okay.  What -- what month-long silence is

          2   Mr. Slemaker referring to?

          3      A. I have no idea.

          4      Q. Okay.

          5      A. I don't believe that's factual.  I have no

          6   idea.

          7      Q. Okay.

          8                  (Exhibit 15 marked.)

          9              MR. TODD:  Mike, it's the same issue

         10   with this document.

         11              MR. GARVIN:  Sure.

         12              MR. TODD:  We'll send you the produced

         13   version.

         14      A. Okay.

         15      Q. (BY MR. TODD)  Have you seen this document

         16   before, Mr. Meeks?

         17      A. Yeah.

         18      Q. Okay.  Is it -- did you receive this

         19   document directly from Mr. Slemaker?

         20      A. I did.

         21      Q. Okay.  And it's an acknowledgment of your

         22   resignation from the Lombardi Foundation?

         23      A. Which I demanded.

         24      Q. Okay.  You asked Mr. Slemaker for this?

         25      A. Yes.




                                                                      101



          1      Q. Okay.  And he complied, and he gave it to

          2   you?

          3      A. Yes.  I also demanded my name be removed.

          4   And my name persisted to be there for a little

          5   while.  So I told Rick, "I'm off the board.  Get

          6   my name off the board.  Get my name off the

          7   letterhead.  Get my name off of everything."

          8      Q. Did he?

          9      A. I believe he did.

         10              MR. TODD:  Okay.  Give me just a couple

         11   of minutes.  We'll go off the record real quick?

         12                        (Recess.)

         13              MR. TODD:  We have no further questions.

         14   Pass the witness.

         15              MR. GARVIN:  No examination.

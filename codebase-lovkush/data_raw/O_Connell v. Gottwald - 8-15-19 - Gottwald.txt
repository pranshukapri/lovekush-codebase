         10   is secured by our bank account.

         11        Q.   What is the security for the Square loan?

         12        A.   The way that we pay the loan back is a

         13   percentage of our credit card charges.  So 20 percent of

         14   every credit card we process, they keep.

         15        Q.   Okay.  So Square is the little device you put

          6   through any business that you have an ownership interest

          7   in, other than what you have described to us?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Okay.  Mr. Bare, is there a due date on that

         12   mean it's -- it's a point of contention.

         13        Q.   How so?

         14        A.   Because I owe the money.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And has he asked for it to be repaid?

         16        A.   He asks, but --

         17        Q.   And what have you told him?

         18        A.   -- he understands our circumstances.

         19        Q.   What have you told him?

         20        A.   I told him that as we can, we will.

          4   by that, I mean, do you own stock, do you have a CD,

          6        A.   Nothing.

         14        A.   They do.

         15        Q.   Where is that real property?

         16        A.   In West Virginia.

         17        Q.   And do you expect your spouse is a beneficiary

         18   under her parents' wills?

         19        A.   Possibly.  I mean, I would assume so, but they

         20   have their on-and-off times.

         21        Q.   Okay.  Have you sold any property to anybody in

         22   the last three years?

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   And, then, let's talk about equipment.  Does --

         25   do you own any business equipment, to operate your job?




                                                                       21

          2        Q.   Yes.

          3        A.   -- does the business?

          4        Q.   First, let's start with you.

          5        A.   I do not.

          6        Q.   Does the business own any equipment?

          7        A.   The business does, yes.

          8        Q.   Describe the equipment that the business owns.

          9        A.   We own a few hydraulic machines, hydraulic

         10   machines to lift houses, we own a few box vans.  They're

         11   not really in our company name; they're in my previous

         12   partner's name.

         13        Q.   What name would that be?

         14        A.   I'm not sure how he has those titled, but I

         15   believe it's in B.J., but I'm not sure.

         16        Q.   It's in what?

         17        A.   B.J.

         18        Q.   B.J.?

         19        A.   Yeah.

         20        Q.   So the -- let's take them one at a time.

         21        A.   Yeah.

         22        Q.   The hydraulic lifts --

         23        A.   Yeah.

         24        Q.   -- are titled --

         25        A.   They're not titled.




                                                                       22



          1        Q.   They're just owned by Texas Duratech, LLC, or

          2   are they owned by B.J.?

          3        A.   Duratech Texas, LLC.

          4        Q.   Okay.  And how about the vehicles, how are they

          5   titled?

          6        A.   I believe they're titled -- I don't even know

          7   if they're titled, to be honest with you, because we got

          8   them on a lease.  So I'm not sure that they're titled.

          9   But it would be in B.J.'s name, if they were.

         10        Q.   All right.  We were talking about equipment

         11   that the company uses to perform its hydraulic -- how

         12   many hydraulic lifts --

         13        A.   Three.

         14        Q.   Three.  And how many box vans?

         15        A.   Three.

         16        Q.   Any other equipment that is owned, either by

         17   you or by the entities in which you have an ownership

         18   interest?

         19        A.   There's hand tools.

         20        Q.   Okay.

         21        A.   Bottle jacks, shovels, saws.

         22        Q.   And that's all owned by which entity?

         23        A.   Duratech Texas, LLC.

         24        Q.   What does B.J. do today, as an entity?  Is it

         25   operational?




                                                                       23



          1        A.   I don't know.  To be honest with you, I do not

          2   know.

          3        Q.   And who were the owners or participants in

          4   B.J.?

          5        A.   Well, B.J. was going to be my partner, but it

          6   never officially became a partnership, so he really

          7   wasn't a partner.

          8        Q.   All right.  Was there ever an entity's name?

          9   You know, a business entity that was created?

         10        A.   I do not believe so, no.

         11        Q.   When you --

         12        A.   There may have been one created, but I don't

         13   think it was ever charted or...

         14        Q.   You have a lawyer here with you today,

         15   Mr. Libby.  Are there other lawyers that you employ

         16   today?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   Okay.  For example, to create the LLC that

         19   currently operates and employs you, who created that?

         20   Which lawyer?

         21        A.   Lodhi.  But he didn't use an attorney.  He went

         22   online, did it himself.  He's an Ph.D., in finance, so he

         23   knows how to do all that stuff.

         24        Q.   And we were talking about accountants.  Any

         25   other accountants or bookkeepers that you have used in




                                                                       24



          1   the last five years?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   And if I asked you to list out which

          4   bookkeepers or accountants you have used in the last five

          5   years, who would those individuals be?

          6        A.   Well, if I've only used one, being Lodhi, that

          7   would be the one that I would list.

          8        Q.   That would be it?

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   And prior to that --

         11        A.   There were none.

         12        Q.   -- you said you used QuickBooks or --

         13        A.   Right.

         14        Q.   All right.  Where would those records be?  Have

         15   you produced those to us?

         16        A.   No.  But I can get them from QuickBooks.

         17        Q.   Those are things that you have access to?

         18        A.   Right.  Because I asked Lodhi to retain them.

         19        Q.   So, yeah, we would ask for a copy of those.

         20                  We were talking about expenses and income

         21   and property, real estate and other property.  I noticed

         22   that you have some vessels, boats, listed on some of the

         23   documents that have been produced here.

         24                  What watercraft do you own, currently?

         25        A.   I own a '78 Catalina sailboat.




                                                                       25



          1        Q.   Where is that kept?

          2        A.   In a marina down in --

          3        Q.   Clear Lake?

          4        A.   Yeah.

          5        Q.   And do you own any other property in Clear

          6   Lake?

          7        A.   No.

          9        A.   I own an '83 Chris Craft, just an old boat.

         10   It's really just salvage.

         11        Q.   And where is that kept?

         12        A.   In my warehouse.

         13        Q.   Where is that?

         14        A.   At 14620 Hempstead Road.

         15        Q.   Anything else in the warehouse, that is your

         16   property?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   Any other watercraft that you own?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Now, let's talk about vehicles.  You own

         21   vehicles, I take it?

         22        A.   I own one, yes.

         23        Q.   How about your spouse, does she have a vehicle?

         24        A.   She does.

         25        Q.   And how about any of your children, do they




                                                                       26

          5                  What vehicles do you own?

          6        A.   I own a 2009 Volkswagen van.

          7        Q.   And is that titled in your name?

          8        A.   It is.

          9        Q.   Where is that vehicle?  Like where do you keep

         10   it?

         11        A.   In my driveway.

         12        Q.   All right.  Do you own any other vehicles?

         13        A.   I think my son's truck is in my name.

         14        Q.   What make and model is that?

         15        A.   It's a 1999 Dodge truck.

                                                                       27



          1        Q.   And what vehicles?

          2        A.   She has a 2007 Jeep.

          3        Q.   Okay.  And where is that vehicle kept?

          4        A.   It's a long story.  She was abducted about a

          5   month-and-a-half ago, and missing for four days, and we

          6   recovered her vehicle.  When we recovered her, she was

          7   face down, nude, on the side of the road, and we

          8   recovered her vehicle, so it's not operable.

          9        Q.   It's not operable?

         10        A.   No.

         16        Q.   -- abduction?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Any other vehicles that your spouse owned?

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   All right.  You told me your son has a truck.

         21   You think it could be in your name.

         22                  Any other vehicles that any of your family

         23   are using, that could be either in your name or in

         24   Duratech Texas?

         25        A.   No.




                                                                       28



          1        Q.   Does Duratech Texas own any vehicles other than

          2   the box vans we talked about?

          3        A.   Yes.  A 2011 Ford pickup truck.

          6        Q.   And do you know how much is owed on the loan?

          7        A.   12,500.

          8        Q.   And do you know who provided the loan?

          9        A.   I'll find out.  I don't know, exactly.  I

         10   didn't handle it.  Wajid handled it.

         11        Q.   And are payments on that vehicle made through

         12   the company?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   Any other vehicles that either you, a family

         15   member or a business in which you have an interest, owns?

         16        A.   No.

         17        Q.   We've covered all of them?

         18        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   Do you or your spouse have any type of

         22   retirement accounts?

         23        A.   No.

         24        Q.   Okay.  Tax returns.  I think when I came in

         25   this morning, your lawyer handed me a document, "Preview




                                                                       29



          1   Copy - Do Not File, 2018."

          2                  Did you -- have you filed your 2018 tax

          3   return?

          4        A.   Yes.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Is this document -- I'll pass it to you.

          6   Is this document a full and complete copy of that

          7   return --

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   -- because this one's not signed, and -- take a

         10   look at it and see.

         11        A.   It is.  I reviewed it, and I'm the one that

         12   provided it.

         13        Q.   All right.  I notice that it's not a joint

         14   return.  Why is that?

         15        A.   My wife just files her own.  I think she files

         16   her own and I file my own.

         17        Q.   You file separate returns --

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   -- but you're married?

         20        A.   Well, I'm not sure if it -- yes.  But I think

         21   mine's head of household.

         22        Q.   Yours is head of household, but you are

         23   married, right?

         24        A.   I am married, yes.

         25        Q.   And you -- she files her own tax return?




                                                                       30



          1        A.   That's correct.

          2        Q.   Okay.  So I'd make a request for her tax

          3   returns because it's a community property regime.

          4        A.   Yes.

          5        Q.   All right.

          6        A.   She has no income.  She just files it because

          7   you're supposed to.

          8        Q.   Okay.  So we'll need to get copies of her

          9   income tax returns.

         10                  I don't know whether this is all of the

         11   returns we've asked for, but I will look at the material

         12   that you guys have provided, and, if not, I'll follow up

         13   with your counsel.  Okay?

         14                  MR. LIBBY:  Okay.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Liens or mortgages.  Are there any liens

         16   or mortgages, that you're aware of, on any property,

         17   other than that we've described?  You told me there's a

         18   lien on the F150 truck.

         19                  Are there any other liens or mortgages on

         20   anything that you're aware of, that we haven't already

         21   talked about?  I assume the loan from Square is secured

         22   by the credit card transfer; is that right?

         23        A.   Correct.

         24        Q.   Any other liens or mortgages, that you're aware

         25   of, on any property that you or your family owns or any

          1   business in which you have an interest?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Are you scheduled to receive any tax

          4   refunds?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   Are you scheduled to receive any income from

          7   any source, that we haven't talked about already?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Have you transferred any property to your wife

         18        Q.   Is there any property that you have received an

         21        Q.   Have you established any trusts?

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   Are you the beneficiaries of any trusts?

         24        A.   No.

         25        Q.   Are you the trustee in any trust?




                                                                       32



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   Is there any real property located in

          3   Montgomery County, that you have an interest in?

          4        A.   No.

          5        Q.   Is there any real property located in Harris

          7   directly, or any business entity?

          8        A.   No.  I own no property nowhere.

          9        Q.   And none of the businesses that you have an

         10   interest in, own property, to your knowledge?

         11        A.   There's only one business that I have an

         12   interest in, and it's Duratech Texas, LLC, and we own

         13   nothing.

         14        Q.   What are you doing today with your business?

         15   What type of work are you doing?  How do you get paid?

         16   Let's talk about that.

         17        A.   We do foundation repairs.

         18        Q.   Okay.

         19        A.   And we do foundation lifts.

         20        Q.   All right.  And how do you typically get paid

         21   from the customers of Duratech Texas?

         22        A.   Sometimes by check, sometimes by credit card.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And if you're paid by check, what do you

         24   do with those checks?  Are they deposited into a bank

         25   account?




                                                                       33



          1        A.   Of course.  That's the only way you can...

          2        Q.   And what bank account is that?

          3        A.   Chase Bank.

          4        Q.   Have you used any other bank account?

          5        A.   No other banks.

          6        Q.   Okay.  Do you have a --

          7        A.   Well, in the past.

          8        Q.   Yes.  But I mean today.

          9        A.   Yeah.

         10        Q.   Do you have a contact at Chase?  Somebody

         11   that's responsible for your account?

         12        A.   Just an 800 number.

         13        Q.   And where did you open the account?  What

         14   office?

         15        A.   I didn't open it.  Lodhi opened it.

         16        Q.   What office did he go to, to open the account?

         17        A.   Maybe somewhere in Meyerland.

         18        Q.   Can you be any more specific?

         19        A.   I can't.  Not today.  I can, later.

         20        Q.   Are you owed any money by Lodhi?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   I know, at one time, you had applied for an SBA

         23   loan.

         24        A.   Uh-huh.

         25        Q.   Do you recall telling me that --




                                                                       34



          1        A.   Sure.

          2        Q.   -- I think at the last deposition?

          3        A.   Yeah.

          4        Q.   And to do that, you had to fill out paperwork.

          5        A.   Yeah.

          6        Q.   Am I correct?

          7        A.   Correct.

          8        Q.   Where is that loan application?  Do you have a

          9   copy of it?

         10        A.   I do not.

         11        Q.   Okay.  Did you -- where is it?  Is it online?

         12        A.   No.  We went to Lone Star College, out in

         13   Cypress.  They had a -- several weeks that they set up

         14   shop there, to assist people, and we did it there.  And I

         15   don't think we retained any copies.  They -- they

         16   collected all that documentation.

         17                  MR. MAYER:  So, Mr. Libby, I would ask

         18   that you -- let's make a double-check, and make sure we

         19   don't have any copies of the --

         20        A.   If I had them, I would certainly provide them.

         21   It would be to my benefit to do that.

         22        Q.   Have you provided a financial statement to any

         23   person or entity in the last five years --

         24        A.   No.

         25        Q.   -- other than the SBA?  I assume they required




                                                                       35



          1   something from you.

          2        A.   Correct.  No.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Have you filled out a financial

          4   statement in the last 12 months?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   Do you have any type of pension?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   Any right to any pension?

          9        A.   (No response).

         10        Q.   And other than the SBA loan, what loans have

         11   you applied for -- maybe not received, but applied for,

         12   in the last five years?

         13        A.   I don't recall any, other than that loan.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Square -- I take it the company applied

         15   for a loan with Square?

         16        A.   Square solicited us.

         17        Q.   Okay.  But there was some paperwork you had to

         18   complete, to get the loan?

         19        A.   No.  It was shocking.  No.  They just went

         20   based on our --

         21        Q.   Volume of credit card?

         22        A.   Yeah.

         23        Q.   Any other -- any loans that you have applied

         24   for in the last five years, other than SBA?

         25        A.   No.  No loans.




                                                                       36



          1        Q.   And no financial statements?

          2        A.   No financial statements, no loans.

          3        Q.   Okay.  You filed tax returns in the last five

          4   years?

          5        A.   No.  Before 2018, the last tax return was 2009.

          6        Q.   And why is that?

          7        A.   There was really no income.

          8        Q.   So you filed a tax return in 2009 and then one

          9   in 2018, but between 2009 and 2018, your testimony is,

         10   you filed no Federal income tax?

         11        A.   You're correct.

         12        Q.   And did your spouse file returns during those

         13   years?

         14        A.   I believe she did, yeah.

         15        Q.   So I'd like to get a copy of those.

         16        A.   Sure.

         17        Q.   Why is it that you decided to file in 2018?

         18        A.   Because it was time to file.

         19        Q.   Did you have any correspondence from the

         20   Federal Government, indicating that you were delinquent

         21   or --

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   Have you paid any penalties to the --

         24        A.   No.

         25        Q.   -- U.S. Government for --




                                                                       37



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   -- failure to file tax returns?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   And the returns that your spouse filed in

          5   2010 -- did she file one in 2010?

          6        A.   Yes.

          7        Q.   '11?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   '12?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   '13?

         12        A.   Yes.

         13        Q.   '14?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   '15?

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   '16?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   '17?

         20        A.   Yes.

         21        Q.   And '18?

         22        A.   Yes.  As far as I know.  I've given you the

         23   best of my knowledge.

         24        Q.   Did she file those as a married person?

         25        A.   I believe so, yes.




                                                                       38



          1        Q.   And would those tax returns be the best

          2   evidence of her income and expenses during that time

          3   period?

          4        A.   Yes.  Which there was no income.

          5        Q.   Right.  Okay.  Have you filed tax returns in

          6   any other state?

          7        A.   No.

          8        Q.   To your knowledge, has your spouse filed tax

          9   returns in any other state?

         10        A.   No.

         11        Q.   Your lawyer handed me a document, Statement of

         12   Inability to Afford Payment of Court Costs or an appeal

         13   bond.  And is that something you filed in the last day or

         14   so?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   We'll get to that in a minute.

         17                  What are your plans, Mr. Gottwald, to

         18   satisfy the judgment in this case?

         19        A.   File an appeal.

         20        Q.   Do you have -- assuming the appeal's

         21   unsuccessful, do you have a plan to try to satisfy the

         22   judgment?

         23        A.   Not until we go through the appeal process.

         24        Q.   Do you owe money to anybody, other than what

         25   we've talked about?  You, personally, or any business




                                                                       39



          1   that you have an interest in.

          2                  Do you owe your lawyer?

          3        A.   I owe my lawyer, for sure.

          4        Q.   Okay.  Anybody else?

          5        A.   I'm not sure.  I mean, I -- I don't believe so.

          6        Q.   How much money do you owe your lawyer,

          7   Mr. Libby?

          8        A.   I'm not sure.

          9        Q.   Is it more than $5,000?

         10        A.   Oh, yes.

         11        Q.   More than $10,000?

         12        A.   I'm not sure.  That's something that we would

         13   have to go over and review.

         14        Q.   And how is that memorialized?  How do you know

         15   how much you owe him?  Do you get an invoice from him?

         16        A.   That would be something for you to ask him, not

         17   me.  I mean --

         18        Q.   No.  But how do you know it's more than $5,000?

         19   That's what I'm asking.

         20        A.   Well, I don't know for sure.

         21        Q.   Have you received any invoice from your

         22   counsel, indicating an amount that you owe?

         23        A.   Yes.

         24        Q.   Okay.  And how much was that invoice?

         25        A.   I don't remember.  It was a long time ago.  I




                                                                       40



          1   don't remember.

          2        Q.   When is the last time you've paid your counsel

          3   anything?

          4        A.   That would all be something we would have to

          5   get from his office.  I'm not sure.  It's been a while.

          6        Q.   When you say it's been a while, has it been

          7   more than two months?

          8        A.   Oh, yeah.

          9        Q.   Is it more than six months?

         10        A.   Maybe within six months, I would say.

         11        Q.   And do you receive a regular statement from his

         12   office?

         13        A.   No, because I think he understands my

         14   situation, at this point.  I think that he's -- we're

         15   going to settle that up when the time comes, if it comes.

         16                  MR. MAYER:  I would request a copy of

         17   whatever the outstanding invoice is.

         18                  (Exhibit 1 marked)

         19        Q.   I'm handing you a copy of what's been marked as

         20   Exhibit 1, which is the judgment in this case.  Correct,

         21   sir?  That's the judgment in this case?

         22        A.   It appears so.

         23        Q.   Okay.  I just want to ask you some questions.

         24   Let's start with G Group.  What is G Group and does

         25   G Group have any assets?




                                                                       41



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   What is G Group?

          3        A.   G Group was a -- I built houses, for the City

          4   of Houston, for the low-income housing.

          5        Q.   Right.

          6        A.   And it was through a charity, for a number of

          7   years, but the charity went -- they went broke.  Whitney

          8   Bank went out of business, that was funding the charity,

          9   and needless to say, we lost a lot of money.

         10        Q.   Duratech Services and Duratech Foundation

         11   Repair, those were both d/b/a's, doing business as?

         12        A.   Correct.

         13        Q.   They weren't separate legal entities; is that

         14   correct?

         15        A.   Correct.

         16        Q.   And the same with G Group; is that correct?  It

         17   was a d/b/a?

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   All right.  We served some discovery requests

         20   on you following the judgment.  Have you looked for

         21   documents that are responsive to those requests and

         22   provided all of those documents to your counsel?

         23        A.   We're in the process.

         24        Q.   What additional material are you going to be

         25   producing?




                                                                       42

          2        Q.   Okay.

          3        A.   And whatever has not been fulfilled on the

          4   request.

          5        Q.   Let's go through them quickly, and we'll just

          6   make sure.  There were two requests.  One was to you,

          7   personally, and then one was to Duratech.  Okay?

          8        A.   Okay.

          9        Q.   I'm on the one for Duratech.  Your bank

         10   accounts reflecting amounts and transactions in all

         11   accounts from March of '15 through the present.

         12        A.   Uh-huh.

         13        Q.   Has that been produced or are you in process of

         14   producing?

         15        A.   We're in the process.

         16        Q.   Produce all Federal and state income tax

         17   records.  I did not see any returns for any entities.

         18   I've seen your 2018 return.  Have you produced the income

         19   tax returns for Duratech?

         20        A.   I'll have to find out.

         21        Q.   Okay.  I don't believe I've seen those.  And

         22   then you are going to give us the tax returns that your

         23   spouse filed --

         24        A.   Correct.

         25        Q.   -- between 2009 and the present.

          6                  Has that been produced, or are you in the

          7   process of producing those?

          8        A.   I believe some of it has been produced.

          9        Q.   Okay.

         10        A.   And whatever is needed, we'll produce.

         13   reflecting any assets that you may possess in the next

         14   nine months.  I take it there are none, to your

         15   knowledge; is that correct?

         16        A.   Doesn't appear there's any good fortune there,

          1        Q.   Okay.  Federal and state income tax records,

          2   we've talked about that.  You're going to supplement the

         17   ago.

          5        Q.   No Bitcoin?

          6        A.   No Bitcoin.

          7        Q.   All right.

          8        A.   I think there may be $50 in Ethereum, that my

          9   son set up in his account, but that's it.

         10        Q.   Do you have any insurance?

         11        A.   Other than business insurance?

         21        Q.   And what type of insurance do you have?

         24   policies for the allegations that were made in this

         25   lawsuit, and the judgment that's now been issued?




                                                                       49



          1        A.   No.

          2        Q.   If you were to make a claim, what company would

          3   you file the claim with?

          5   policy, at that time.

          6        Q.   When you did work for the Plaintiff?

          7        A.   I would have to check, but I believe that --

          8   I'm not sure.  I'd have to look.

         10   would make a request that you identify and produce any

                                                                       51



          1        Q.   He lives in the house with you guys?

          2        A.   He does.

          3        Q.   Okay.  Adam, who's 27, lives in Dallas?

          4        A.   No.  Mitchell lives in Dallas.

          5        Q.   Okay.  Where does Adam live?

          6        A.   He lives with me.

          7        Q.   And is he employed, elsewhere?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   What does he do?

         10        A.   He does a few things for us at the business.

         11        Q.   But you said he's not a steady employee?

         12        A.   Correct.  He's a single father.

         13        Q.   And then Austin is his son?

         14        A.   Correct.

         15        Q.   All right.  Have you transferred any property

         16   to any of those individuals in the last five years?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   And do you have a set salary from Duratech

         19   Texas, LLC?

         20        A.   I do.

         21        Q.   It's $1,500 per month?

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   And then you said there's another $2,500 for

         24   reimbursement of expenses?

         25        A.   Correct.




                                                                       52



          1        Q.   And your total income is $4,000?

          2        A.   You're correct.

          3        Q.   And you have income from no other sources?

          4        A.   No other source.

          5        Q.   All right.  For the value of your property, you

          6   indicated a negative balance at Chase?

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Why is that?

          9        A.   It's just our cash flow.  Some days there's a

         10   little cash in there, some days there's not.  It just has

         11   to do with operating a business.

         12        Q.   And for vehicles and boats, you listed a VW

         13   van, a Catalina sailboat, a Chris Craft and a watch.  A

         14   Luminox watch of $100, and I think you mentioned some

         15   other things.

         16                  Do you have any jewelry?

         17        A.   No.

         18        Q.   Does your spouse have any jewelry?

         19        A.   No.  Not really.  Not of any interest, for

         20   sure.

         21        Q.   Anything else of value that you own that is not

         22   identified on the document that you filed with the court

         23   requesting assistance in paying for the appeal?

         24        A.   Just household goods.  Couch, lawnmower, things

         25   like that.




                                                                       53



          1        Q.   It's indicated here that you have some credit

          2   card debt of approximately $6,400.  What credit card is

          3   that with?

          4        A.   Chase, Barclay and Capital One.

          5        Q.   And you said, I have outstanding personal loans

          6   of $15,600.  And to whom do you owe that?

          7        A.   William Bare.

          8        Q.   That's the loan that you described earlier in

          9   this deposition?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   All right.  And the credit card debts are to

         12   Chase, Capital One, and what was the third?

         13        A.   Barclay.

         14        Q.   Are those credit cards in your name?

         15        A.   They are.

         16        Q.   You're also going to provide the QuickBooks

         17   material to us?

         18        A.   Yes, sir.  Anything you request.

         19        Q.   Do you and your spouse have anybody that acts

         20   as a financial advisor for you?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   The tax returns that your wife filed, who

         23   prepared those?  Did you help her?

         24        A.   No.  I believe it was a lady by the name of

         25   Sean Slaughter, who has a tax service.




                                                                       54



          1        Q.   And did she sign the returns, as the preparer?

          2        A.   I believe so.  I mean, I --

          3        Q.   Okay.  Where is she located?

          4        A.   Off of Bissonnet, somewhere.

          5        Q.   And her name is Sean?

          6        A.   Slaughter.

          7        Q.   Slaughter.  And has she done any work for you?

          8        A.   No.

          9        Q.   Just your spouse?

         10        A.   Just my spouse, that I can remember.

         11        Q.   Have you had any property appraised, either

         12   commercial property, equipment, vehicles, anything

         13   appraised, in the last 12 months?

         14        A.   No.

         15        Q.   How about the last five years?

         16        A.   Never.

         17        Q.   Have you filed an insurance claim on any of the

         18   equipment --

         19        A.   No.

         20        Q.   -- last five years?

         21        A.   No.  No.  I think we had damage to one of the

         22   doors, on one of the trucks, and I think we filed a claim

         23   on that.

         24        Q.   No theft claims, no disappearing property

         25   claims?




                                                                       55



          1        A.   We had a lot of theft, but we had no insurance

          2   to cover it.  We had a lot of losses, due to the flood.

          3   We didn't have insurance to cover it.

          4        Q.   I think I asked you this earlier, and if I did,

          5   I apologize.  Do you have somebody who, at Chase, is your

          6   contact person?

          7        A.   No.  Big banks are shying away from that, I

          8   think.

          9        Q.   Where do you keep the financial records for

         10   your personal?  Where do you keep those records?

         11        A.   My computer.

         12        Q.   Okay.

         13        A.   I'm missing a great deal of it because we -- I

         14   took my family to San Antonio, I can't remember the date,

         15   but my computer was stolen from the hotel, so there went

         16   many, many years.

         17        Q.   Do either you or your wife own a Saab?

         18        A.   No.  That belongs to my son.

         19        Q.   Okay.  Is that a vehicle that you paid for?

         20        A.   No.  That's my son's.

         21        Q.   Which son?

         22        A.   Adam.

         23        Q.   And does Adam drive that vehicle today?

         24        A.   He does, yes.

         25        Q.   Who drives the Jeep Cherokee?




                                                                       56



          1        A.   That's the one that was --

          2        Q.   Recovered after the abduction?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   And how about a Mercedes Benz C, who drives

          5   that?

          6        A.   That is no longer.  It was totaled.

          7        Q.   Whose vehicle was that?

          8        A.   That was my wife's.

          9        Q.   When was that totaled?

         10        A.   About a year-and-a-half, two years ago.  Two

         11   years ago, at least.

         12        Q.   Now, we talked a little bit about your assets

         13   and loans and who owes you money.

         14                  Now I want to talk about what legal

         15   proceedings, besides this one, you are involved in.  Are

         16   there any other customers who are -- have sued you?

         17        A.   No.  I have thousands of customers, and --

         18        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any criminal or civil

         19   proceedings pending, that you are defending against,

         20   today?

         21        A.   No.

         22        Q.   What is located at 1980 Post Oak, Suite 1535?

         23   I saw that address turn up for Duratech Texas, LLC.  What

         24   is at that location?

         25        A.   I'm not sure, but it may have been a filing --




                                                                       57



          1   depending upon the date, it may have been a filing

          2   address.

          3        Q.   14620 Hempstead, you described that to us.

          4   That's the property that you no longer own?

          5        A.   No.  That's our warehouse we lease.

          6        Q.   Okay.  But it's leased, it's not something you

          7   own?

          8        A.   It's leased, correct.

          9        Q.   11875 West Little York.

         10        A.   That was a previous address that we leased.

         11        Q.   Okay.  All right.  Let's see what else we've

         12   got here.  I'm just going to ask you to explain some of

         13   these.  These are records we got last night.

         14                  This looks like a Chase account statement,

         15   January through -- January 1 through January 31st --

         16        A.   Uh-huh.

         17        Q.   -- and it has deposits and additions.  Is this

         18   a copy of the statement for Duratech Texas?

         19        A.   It is.

         20        Q.   Okay.  Just -- let's go line by line on the

         21   top.  Can you just explain what that first entry is?

         22   Just read it out loud, and then describe it.

         23        A.   Beginning balance?

         24        Q.   No.  The actual transactions.

         25        A.   You mean, received payment --




                                                                       58



          1        Q.   Yes.

          2        A.   -- from Square?

          3        Q.   Yes.

          4        A.   That would be a credit card process.

          5        Q.   So that would be a customer paying you --

          6        A.   Correct.

          7        Q.   -- that would be processed through Square?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   And, then, is that the gross amount or is

         10   that -- they've already taken their 20 percent?

         11        A.   They would have taken their 20 percent.

         12        Q.   Okay.  Got it.

         13        A.   That would be the received amount.  The

         14   realized amount.

         15        Q.   Okay.  And, then, there's an entry on January

         16   the 4th, that says deposit.  Do you see that?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   Okay.  Now, that's a -- what is the amount of

         19   that deposit?

         20        A.   2,471.

         21        Q.   Okay.  So how was that made?  Is that a check

         22   deposit?  What is that?

         23        A.   You know, it doesn't break it down, and it

         24   would be impossible for me to remember.

         25        Q.   Uh-huh.




                                                                       59



          1        A.   It would either be a -- we don't really ever

          2   take cash.  So it would, most likely, be a check.

          3        Q.   Let's go to the most recent one.  Okay.  Let's

          4   just take -- this is -- so let's take a look at this

          5   document.

          6                  This is a copy of a Chase statement.

          7   Instead of Duratech, this is you, personally; is that

          8   right?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Let's look at the transaction piece.  What is

         11   the first entry on that?

         12        A.   ATM cash deposit.

         13        Q.   Okay.  So that reflects a cash deposit into the

         14   account of a thousand dollars?

         15        A.   Yes.

         16        Q.   That was made through an ATM?

         17        A.   Yes.

         18        Q.   And that deposit was made in cash?

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   So you had a thousand dollars cash, you went to

         21   an ATM, and --

         22        A.   Yes.

         23        Q.   -- deposited it into the account?

         24        A.   Yes.

         25        Q.   Okay.




                                                                       60



          1        A.   And if I can explain further.

          2        Q.   Sure.

          3        A.   You'll notice that there's business expenses

          4   that I paid out of my personal account, and it would have

          5   been reimbursement from the business.

          6        Q.   That's the $2,500 you get in addition from your

          7   $1,500 salary?

          8        A.   No.  No.

          9        Q.   Okay.

         10        A.   That would be for business transactions that

         11   occurred, that I paid for out of my personal account,

         12   so --

         13        Q.   Give me an example of one.

         14        A.   Just buying materials.  Any type of materials.

         15   Like you'll see Home Depot.  There's several Home Depots

         16   here.  You'll see others for Best Block, for materials

         17   that we're buying from Best Block, $352; Home Depot, $48.

         18   These are all business expenses.  United Rental.

         19        Q.   Why would you pay those out of your personal

         20   account, as opposed to using the Chase Duratech?

         21        A.   Well, it's sort of to be kind of strategic.  If

         22   the bank account is low, for Duratech, and we can't buy

         23   materials, we have to continue to get -- to fulfill the

         24   customers' projects.

         25        Q.   So the way you guys look at it as -- if you had




                                                                       61



          1   the cash in your personal account, you'd use that.  If

          2   you had the cash in the company account, you'd use that.

          3   It was whatever worked best.

          4        A.   It's whatever was available.

          5        Q.   At the time.

          6        A.   Right.

          7        Q.   And even though they're separate accounts, you

          8   guys treated it as if you needed to service the

          9   customers, and used the account that had the money?

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   Okay.  And that's the way you operated --

         12        A.   Yes.

         13        Q.   -- for at least all of 2019?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   Okay.  Okay.  There's something here that says,

         16   Quick pay with Zelle, Z-E-L-L-E, payment to Jack Hopper.

         17        A.   Uh-huh.  That's personal.

         18        Q.   What is --

         19        A.   That's a personal expense.

         20        Q.   Okay.  That wasn't something that was -- who is

         21   Jack Hopper, and what were you paying him for?

         22        A.   He is the owner of a boat slip, and I paid him

         23   for the boat slip.

         24        Q.   To keep the boat?

         25        A.   Yes.




                                                                       62



          1        Q.   Got it.  Then on July the 19th, there's another

          2   ATM cash deposit.  So why are you making deposits in

          3   cash?

          4        A.   Well, from -- if the accountant is unavailable,

          5   to move it from one account to the other, I go to the

          6   bank,  get the cash and move it.

          7        Q.   So I would say see -- would I see a similar

          8   entry over on the Duratech Texas --

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   -- of an ATM withdrawal of that amount?

         11        A.   Yes.

         12        Q.   So if they didn't have the money to pay you by

         13   check for the $1,500, you would just take the cash and --

         14        A.   Correct.

         15        Q.   -- put it in your account?

         16        A.   Yes.  I don't take cash from customers, so it's

         17   not customer cash.

         18        Q.   All right.  So this is the July 10th through

         19   August 8th statement for your personal account.

         20        A.   Uh-huh.

         21        Q.   And would you just look at the deposits?  And

         22   looks to me like every single deposit in there is a cash

         23   deposit.  Would you confirm that for me?

         24        A.   Well, there's other deposits which are -- which

         25   was the amount that the company pays me.  I'm not sure if




                                                                       63



          1   I paid myself on this month or if the business paid me on

          2   this month, because the business can't always afford to

          3   pay me every month, so...

          4        Q.   But my question is, just take a look at this

          5   statement and confirm for us that the deposits that were

          6   made, they're all cash deposits.

          7        A.   No.  There's other deposits.  I'm not sure.

          8   I'd have to break it down.

          9        Q.   Where did you get all this cash?

         10        A.   I just explained that to you.

         11        Q.   You went to the business and withdrew the cash

         12   from the business ATM?

         13        A.   To put it in this one, to make sure that there

         14   was money to fulfill the projects.

         15        Q.   And when you were receiving your monthly

         16   paycheck from -- do you get a W-2 from Duratech Texas?

         17        A.   Yes, I do.

         18        Q.   And do you get a K-1, at the end of the year?

         19        A.   I'm not sure.

         20        Q.   Do you get a W-2 from any entity, other than

         21   Duratech Texas?

         22        A.   No.

         23        Q.   Okay.  And have you received a K-1 from any

         24   entity?

         25        A.   Not that I'm aware of.




                                                                       64



          1        Q.   Okay.

          2        A.   But that doesn't mean -- necessarily mean

          3   that -- I don't know, for sure, what a K-1 is.  My

          4   accountant handles that.

          5        Q.   Who is that accountant?

          6        A.   Wajid Lodhi.

          7        Q.   We were talking about your personal statement,

          8   so I'm going to go ahead and mark it as 2.  Okay?

          9        A.   Yep.

         10                  (Exhibit 2 marked)

         11        Q.   Would you confirm for us that Exhibit 2 is the

         12   personal statement from Chase, for you, Greg Gottwald,

         13   that we have been talking about the last few minutes?

         14        A.   Yes.

         15        Q.   Okay.

         16        A.   It's -- it's not labeled correctly down here.

         17        Q.   That's a Bates number at the bottom.  I think

         18   that's the --

         19        A.   This Duratech Services, LLC is not correct.

         20        Q.   What should it say?

         21        A.   It should say Gregory Gottwald.

         22                  (Exhibit 3 marked)

         23        Q.   And then I think we want to confirm that

         24   Exhibit 3 is your 2018, as filed, tax return.  Would you

         25   take a look through Exhibit 3?  This is a document your




                                                                       65



          1   counsel handed me at the beginning.

          2                  And would you confirm for us that

          3   Exhibit 3, although it is unsigned, it is a copy of what

          4   you actually filed with the United States Government for

          5   your tax return dated 2018?

          6        A.   Yes, it is.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Now, on Exhibit 2 -- I'm sorry,

          8   Exhibit 3, you were asked to list your dependents.  Who

          9   did you list in your 2018 filing?

         10        A.   As written on the tax return, Thomas Stone

         11   Gottwald.

         12        Q.   Did you list anyone else as a dependent?

         13        A.   No.  Not according to the --

         14        Q.   And, obviously, what you filed with the

         15   Government, was true and accurate?

         16        A.   Yes.

         17        Q.   All right.  I have something that is called

         18   Duratech Texas, LLC Transaction Report.

         19        A.   Yes.

         20        Q.   Could you just tell me what this document is?

         21        A.   This looks like the breakdown of expenses.

         22        Q.   All right.  And who keeps -- who maintains

         23   this?

         24        A.   This is QuickBooks.

         25        Q.   All right.




                                                                       66



          1        A.   It's derived directly from the bank account.

          2   There's no entry -- no personal entry.

          3        Q.   Already.  So for the cash deposits that we saw,

          4   that you made, what would I expect to see in the

          5   transaction report, to reflect that withdrawal of cash?

          6        A.   Same as the --

          7        Q.   It would be --

          8        A.   That's the only way I have to derive cash.

          9        Q.   It would be ATM withdrawal --

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   -- under your card number, whatever card number

         12   you have?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   Okay.

         15        A.   Or a check.  Possibly a check.

         16        Q.   Now there's something called Thumb Tack.  What

         17   is Thumb Tack?

         18        A.   It's a lead-providing source.

         19        Q.   Say that, again.

         20        A.   Lead provider.

         21        Q.   What do they do?

         22        A.   They provide us with leads.

         23        Q.   And is that Internet advertising?

         24        A.   It is.  It's not really advertising.  It's just

         25   people that request a specific service that contact us.




                                                                       67



          1        Q.   Right.  So there's payments to them on a

          2   regular basis?

          3        A.   Yes.

          4        Q.   Mainstream Mediaworks, what do they do?

          5        A.   That's another -- they are another media

          6   company.

          7        Q.   Okay.  Thumb Tack, Google Ads, those are all --

          8   Bing ads, those are payments/expenses for advertising and

          9   marketing?

         10        A.   Yes.

         11        Q.   All right.  Who is Nick Thiele?  T-H-I-E-L-E.

         13   media.

         14        Q.   And he's paid a certain amount of money to --

         20   PublicData.Com.

         21        A.   Uh-huh.

         22        Q.   What is that for?

         23        A.   We use it to screen our employees.

         24        Q.   And then under automobile expenses -- is there

         25   an automobile lease?




                                                                       68



          1        A.   There is.

          2        Q.   Who's that with?

          3        A.   Pacific Leasing.

          4        Q.   And that's for vehicles that the companies

          5   doesn't own, but uses?

          6        A.   Right.  They're the three box vans.  We don't

          7   actually have an ownership in them.

          8        Q.   They're leased?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Okay.  Rather than take time and go through

         11   this, let me -- let's take a break here.  Let me look

         12   through, see what I have, and there's some additional

         13   material you still have to produce to us, and maybe we

         14   can shortcut this.  Okay?

         15        A.   Yeah.  If you provide us with a list, I'm happy

         16   to do it.

         17                  MR. MAYER:  Okay.

         18                  (Recess from 10:20 a.m.

         19                  to 10:29 a.m.)

         20                  (Exhibit 4 marked)

         21        Q.   Mr. Gottwald, I'm handing you what I've marked

         22   as Exhibit 4.  It looks like a Duratech Texas Chase

         23   statement, March 1, 2019, through March 29.  Would you

         24   confirm that for me?

         25        A.   Yes.




                                                                       69



          1        Q.   If you'd flip to -- there's a section in there

          2   that talks about electronic funds withdrawals.  Right

          3   there, I think.  Is that at the bottom?  Let me see?

          4   Just pass it here, let me make sure that's the right --

          5   yes, ATM Debit and Cash Withdrawals.

          6                  This is the section where I should look

          7   for the cash that you withdrew to deposit in your

          8   personal account?

          9        A.   Correct.

         10        Q.   Is that correct?

         11        A.   Yes.  But I'm not the only person that makes

         12   withdrawals.  There's three people that make withdrawals

         13   there.

         14        Q.   Who are the three people?

         15        A.   Our operations manager.

         16        Q.   Who is?

         17        A.   Steve Roberts.

         18        Q.   Okay.

         19        A.   And Wajid Lodhi.

         20        Q.   What's your card number?

         21        A.   4923, I think.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Why don't you pull it out and confirm

         23   that.

         24        A.   4923.

         25        Q.   Okay.  So if I see a cash withdrawal, card




                                                                       70



          1   4923, that's you?

          2        A.   Correct.

          3        Q.   All right.  Who is card 321, if you know?

          4        A.   I believe -- I'm not sure, but I think that

          5   might be Steve.

          6        Q.   Okay.  And then Wajid, he has his own card.

          7        A.   Yes.

          8        Q.   Am I correct?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   And you don't loan your card to anyone else?

         11        A.   Well, sure I do, yeah.

         12        Q.   You give them the PIN?  You loan your card and

         13   give people the PIN?

         14        A.   Not people I don't know, but employees, yeah,

         15   that have to go buy materials or things, yeah.

         16   Absolutely.

         17        Q.   All right.  Okay.  And then under electronic

         18   withdrawals, that's the section I was going to.  There's

         19   a couple of entries.  Would you walk through each one of

         20   those.  The first one is payroll?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   Okay.  So what is that?

         23        A.   That would be payroll to me.

         24        Q.   So that's how you got paid --

         25        A.   Yes.




                                                                       71



          1        Q.   -- through a direct transaction?

          2        A.   Yes.

          3        Q.   So I thought you said you went and took out

          4   cash to get paid?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   You were paid directly, electronically.

          7        A.   You weren't listening close.

          8        Q.   Okay.

          9        A.   What I said was, we use that money to pay for

         10   expenses that come out of my personal account.  That's

         11   not how I pay myself.

         12        Q.   So the first entry on the -- that --

         13        A.   Is my payroll.

         14        Q.   That's your payroll?

         15        A.   Which is reflected in my tax return.

         16        Q.   Got it.  Next entry?

         17        A.   Pacific Leasing.

         18        Q.   That's the leasing for the --

         19        A.   Trucks.

         20        Q.   -- the box vans?

         21        A.   Yes.

         22        Q.   Okay.  Next entry?

         23        A.   IRS.

         24        Q.   What's that for?

         25        A.   Personal income tax, I believe.  Yeah.




                                                                       72



          1   Personal income tax.

          2        Q.   Does --

          3        A.   Payroll tax.  I'm sorry.

          4        Q.   Yeah.  Does Duratech Texas have employees,

          5   other than you?

          6        A.   No.

          7        Q.   You're the only employee?

          8        A.   Correct.

          9        Q.   What about Mr. Roberts?

         10        A.   Mr. Roberts is a contractor.

         11        Q.   Okay.  So that entry, the IRS, is payroll taxes

         12   just for you?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   Okay.  Keep going.

         15        A.   Champion Energy, that would be our electric

         16   bill.

         17        Q.   Right.

         18        A.   Progressive Insurance would be an insurance

         19   premium.

         20        Q.   For what?

         21        A.   I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'd have to look

         22   into it.

         23        Q.   Okay.

         24        A.   IRS, again, payroll tax.

         25        Q.   Just for you, though?




                                                                       73



          1        A.   It appears as though, yes.

          2        Q.   You're the only employee?

          3        A.   Yes.  And then there's a quick pay to Wajid,

          4   for 500.

          5        Q.   Did he draw a salary?

          6        A.   He does.

          7        Q.   Is it 500 a month?

          8        A.   All depends.  I mean, I don't even get 1,500 a

          9   month, some months, so it all depends.

         10        Q.   But if things are --

         11        A.   Yes.

         12        Q.   If the company has cash --

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   -- is his amount 500 a month?

         15        A.   Yes.  Yes.  And then our Internet is the other

         16   entry.  Do you want me to keep going?

         17        Q.   Yeah.  That's the last of the electronic --

         18        A.   Yes.

         19        Q.   Those are recurring monthly electronic

         20   transfers from that account?

         21        A.   Some of them, yes.  Not all of them.

         22        Q.   All right.  And then on the ATM cash

         23   withdrawals, will you take this pen and circle your card

         24   number, just on one of the entries, and put your initials

         25   by it?




                                                                       74



          1        A.   (Witness complying.)

          2        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

          3        A.   But that doesn't necessarily mean that I made

          4   it.

          5        Q.   I understand.

          6        A.   Like there's several here, like Media Works

          7   and --

          8        Q.   Right.  But that's your card number?

          9        A.   Yes.

         10        Q.   Thank you.

         11        A.   And, also, if I can add.

         12        Q.   Sure.

         13        A.   Some of this cash -- some of these cash

         14   withdrawals, if you'll notice a little further in, there

         15   are bank fees.  I think it's like $7,000 in bank fees.

         16   They're for NSFs and unpaid checks and insufficient funds

         17   and things of that nature.

         18                  Some of -- most of these withdrawals go to

         19   pay for those checks, and you'll see there's a balance

         20   there, cash flow being what it is.

         21        Q.   What current jobs are you working on today, and

         22   what amounts are owed to the company?

         23        A.   I'll have to get a list of those.  I don't have

         24   that with me.

         25        Q.   Okay.  Do you have more than ten current jobs




                                                                       75



          1   going?

          2        A.   No.

          3        Q.   How many, approximately?

          4        A.   Around ten.

          5        Q.   Okay.

          6        A.   Probably more like six or seven, at this point,

          7   but it changes every day.

          8        Q.   You are not an engineer, as I recall; is that

          9   correct?

         10        A.   Correct.

         11        Q.   What permits or licenses do you hold?

         12        A.   There aren't any.

         13        Q.   Okay.

         14        A.   There's none required.  We're trying to get

         15   Bill 6-- I think it's SB 641.  We're trying to get it

         16   passed, but --

         17        Q.   What is that?  I don't know what that is.

         18        A.   Requiring all foundation repair companies to be

         19   licensed.  There's so much competition, it weakens our

         20   ability to charge, in order to maintain a good profit so

         21   we can do a good service, so we're lobbying to try to get

         22   that bill passed.

         23        Q.   I have the Duratech Texas QuickBooks.  Do you

         24   personally use Quicken --

         25        A.   No.




                                                                       76



          1        Q.   -- or do you use any type of software to manage

          2   your own personal finances?

          3        A.   No.

          4        Q.   Have you ever?

          5        A.   No.

          6        Q.   And the QuickBooks is what you use for Duratech

          7   Texas?

          8        A.   Yes.

          9        Q.   All right.  And you used that for your

         10   previous --

         11        A.   Duratech Services.

         12        Q.   Right.  You used QuickBooks?

         13        A.   Yes.

         14        Q.   So that's --

         15        A.   Only for a portion of the time.

         16        Q.   Right.

         17        A.   One year, I think.

         18        Q.   But that's one thing we requested, is that

         19   material.

         20        A.   Right.

         21        Q.   Okay.

         22                  MR. MAYER:  What I would like to do is --

         23   I don't have time to go through the ledgers, obviously,

         24   and what I'd like to do is -- we have asked for some

         25   additional material.  You've answered my questions; I




                                                                       77



          1   appreciate it.

          2                  I'd like to adjourn, let us look at the

          3   additional material and see if we have any follow-up

          4   questions.  Perhaps, we can handle it through your

          5   counsel, rather than reconvene the deposition, on

          6   follow-up questions, but that's how we plan to proceed.

          7                  So we'll adjourn the deposition.  We'll

          8   wait for the additional materials, then we'll be in touch

          9   with your counsel about how to proceed next.  Okay?

         10                  THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

         11                  MR. MAYER:  Thank you very much, and we

         12   appreciate your  --

         13                  THE WITNESS:  These are mine?

         14                  MR. MAYER:  No.  Those stay with the court

         15   reporter.

          10   really not relevant.

          11               THE WITNESS:  Because the guy who

          12   did it was a die-hard racist.  I did some

          13   more investigating about that, and they told

          14   me.  I wasn't even driving.

          15   BY MR. DALY:

          13   guard had us stopped.  A young male was

          14   driving an SUV or something.  I can't

          15   remember what it was.  He was on his phone

          16   and ran into the back of my truck.

          19               Why don't you follow up?  You're

          20   assuming no lights.  He means on your

          21   client's car.  That's what he's talking

          22   about.  Your client didn't have any lights

          23   on.  That's what he's saying.

          17   Q.     Is that still active?

          18   A.     Yes, sir.

          19   Q.     I'm going to show you the police

          20   report that was generated in relation to the

          21   accident.  I'm going to mark this as

          22   Hunter-1.

          23          Have you ever seen this document

          24   before?

           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     Now, this little box with an arrow on

           3   the end is supposed to represent your

           4   vehicle.

           5   A.     Number 2.

           6               MR. DALY:  Do you agree with

           7   that, Ms. Frascella?

           8               MS. FRASCELLA:  Do I agree with

           9   what?

          10               MR. DALY:  Number 2 is supposed

          11   to represent --

          12               MS. FRASCELLA:  I agree that his

          13   vehicle is identified as vehicle 2 on the

          14   police report.

          15   BY MR. DALY:

          16   Q.     Do you disagree with the positioning

          17   of the vehicle --

          18   A.     I was in this lane when it hit me.

          19   Q.     This is the northbound lane here.

          20   A.     Northbound lane, yeah.  This is

          21   southbound lane, right?

          22   Q.     Yeah.

          23   A.     There is two lanes, you know.

          24               MS. FRASCELLA:  Right.  It

           1   doesn't look designated.  There's dots here,

           2   but up here they didn't put the dots.

           3               THE WITNESS:  I think when I hit

           4   that vehicle there I was in this lane.

           5   BY MR. DALY:

           6   Q.     You think she was in the northbound

           7   lane heading south?

           8   A.     No, no, no.  It was on the inside

           9   southbound lane.

          10   Q.     I'm going to take this back from you,

          11   all right?

          12   A.     That lane there.

          13   Q.     I'm going to clear this up for you.

          14   This is supposed to represent the northbound

          15   lane, okay?

          16   A.     That's the northbound lane there.

          17   Q.     That's all northbound.

          18   A.     Okay.  Well, they were in this lane

          19   here.

          20               MS. FRASCELLA:  There is two

          21   lanes coming southbound.

          22               Was she in the right lane or the

          23   left lane of southbound traffic?

          24               THE WITNESS:  The inside lane.

                                                           37



           1               MS. FRASCELLA:  To you, is the

           2   inside lane the left lane or the right lane?

           3               Is the inside closer to the

           4   yellow line or closer to the shoulder?

           5               THE WITNESS:  The outside lane is

           6   the shoulder.  The inside lane is where the

           7   line is at.

           8               MS. FRASCELLA:  So she's in the

           9   inside lane?

          10               THE WITNESS:  Inside lane.

          11   BY MR. DALY:

          12   Q.     Let's say this is the inside lane.

          13   This is the line that separates the two lanes

          14   going southbound, okay?

          15   A.     Uh-huh.

          16   Q.     Now, do you disagree with how the

          17   police officers drew up this accident?

          18   A.     Which lane is this in?

          19   Q.     What?

          20   A.     What lane would that be in right

          21   there?

          22   Q.     The inside lane of the southbound.

          23   A.     The inside lane?

          24   Q.     Yes.

                                                           38



           1   A.     Okay, yeah.

           2   Q.     You agree with the characterization of

           3   the accident per the police report diagram?

           4   A.     My truck was further here than when I

           5   got hit.

           6   Q.     Further which way?

           7   A.     This way.

           8   Q.     Closer to Old York Street?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     How much further?

          11   A.     I really can't say that.  It was here,

          12   this lane here.  I had twisted in this lane

          13   right here when I got hit.  You got a pen?

          14   I'll show you.

          15   Q.     Yeah.

          16   A.     I was in this lane here.  My door was

          17   hit around this area here.

          18   Q.     I don't know what you're saying, but I

          19   want you to mark on this number 2 where the

          20   point of impact was.

          21   A.     (Witness complies with request.)

          22          Right here.

          23               MS. FRASCELLA:  He wants to know

          24   where your vehicle was, not where the cars

           1   hit.

           2   BY MR. DALY:

           3   Q.     I want to know where the car was hit.

           4   A.     You want to know where the car was at?

           5          I was here in here.

           6               MS. FRASCELLA:  Just for the

           7   record, he's indicating his car was farther

           8   up on Conlyn Street than indicated on the

           9   police report.

          10   BY MR. DALY:

          11   Q.     Now, was your vehicle on Broad Street

          12   or Conlyn Street when the accident happened?

          13   A.     One part was on Conlyn Street and one

          14   part was on Broad Street, if you want to call

          15   that Conlyn Street.

          16   Q.     Yeah, I do.

          17          You hadn't completed your turn yet at

          18   that point?

          19   A.     Say again.

          20   Q.     You didn't complete your turn yet at

          21   that point?

          22   A.     I turned because they hit me behind my

          23   door.  I got a two-door truck.  They hit me

          24   behind my door.  My passenger side door and

           1   my fender.

           2               MR. DALY:  I don't have any other

           3   questions.

           4               Anything you want to put on the

           5   record?

           6               MS. FRASCELLA:  No.

           7               MR. DALY:  Thanks, Mr. Hunter.

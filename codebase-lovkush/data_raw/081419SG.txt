           11    A.      An inmate had an injury that -- how do I

           13                   MR. NINOSKY:  I can help.  It's an

           14    alleged failure to diagnose osteomyelitis.  The case is

           15    Farrington.  It's pending in the Eastern District.

           16    Motions for summary judgment are pending.

           17                   THE WITNESS:  I didn't know how much I

           18    was allowed to release, I guess.

           19                   MR. INSCHO:  Okay.

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  She was a witness, she's

           21    not a party.

           23    Q.      Were you represented by Mr. Ninosky in that

           24    case?

                                                                      8




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      What was your role in the care of that

            3    individual?

            4    A.      They wrote a sick call slip which is a request

            5    for medical care and I responded to it and that's it.

            6    Q.      Other than last summer have you ever been

            7    deposed in any other cases?

            8    A.      No.

            9    Q.      Have you ever been a party in a civil lawsuit?

           10    A.      No.

           11    Q.      Have you ever been convicted of a crime?

           12    A.      No.

           13    Q.      Tell me, Ms. Grous, what your educational

           14    background is?

           15    A.      I went to Reading Hospital School of Health

           16    Sciences and got my RN diploma, that was in 2010 I

           17    graduated.  And then I went part-time after that to

           18    Penn State for my Bachelor's in nursing over the course

           19    of a few years.  I think I finally graduated in 2013 or

           20    '14 perhaps and that's it.

           21    Q.      What Penn State campus?

           22    A.      It was the online campus, the world campus.

            1    Q.      Any education between high school and nursing?

            2    A.      Yeah, I went to school for art therapy for a

            3    semester.  Wasn't really into it so I went to Community

            4    College then and just took some general classes to keep

            5    furthering my education and, you know, utilize them

            6    later for nursing.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   Tell me your employment background

            9    starting with your first job in the medical field?

           10    A.      I started at Genesis Healthcare in August of

           11    2010, it's a nursing home.  So I was a registered nurse

           12    there.  I think I was there for 3 years.  And then I

           13    started at Foundations Behavioral Health in Doylestown.

           14    I was there from approximately 2012 to 2016.  I started

           15    as a registered nurse and then eventually became a

           16    charge nurse then health nurse coordinator.  Started at

           17    the Bucks County Correctional Facility with Prime Care

           18    March, 2015 as a per diem nurse for a year then became

           19    full-time.  And as of November I became the Assistant

           20    Director of Nursing.

           21    Q.      November, 2018?

           22    A.      Correct.

           23    Q.      OKAY.

           24                   At the time of Frederick Adami's death

                                                                      10




            1    in January, 2018, what was your position at Prime Care?

            2    A.      I was a full-time registered nurse.

            3    Q.      Was there a period of time you worked both for

            4    Foundations and Bucks County?

            5    A.      Yeah, I think from when I started at Bucks

            6    County so it was March, 2015 just for a year.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   Were you full-time at Foundations?

            9    A.      Yes, I was when I started at Bucks County.

           10    And then once I took the full-time position at Bucks

           11    then I went per diem there at Foundations and

           12    eventually left.

           13    Q.      For the year you were per diem at Bucks

           14    County, Prime Care, how many hours a week did you

           15    average?

           16    A.      I would say 16 to 24 depending on the week.

           17    Q.      Would that equate to 2 or 3 shifts?

           18    A.      Yeah.

           19    Q.      Prior to coming to work at Bucks County have

           20    you worked at any correctional facilities?

           21    A.      No.

           22    Q.      Have you ever worked at any drug and alcohol

           23    facilities or anything like that?

                                                                      11




            1    Q.      Have you ever worked in a hospital?

            2    A.      No.

            3    Q.      What Genesis facility did you work at?

            4    A.      Quakertown Center.

            5    Q.      What type of facility is that?

            6    A.      It's long-term care and they also have

            7    short-term rehab.

            8    Q.      At Genesis Healthcare did you have patients

            9    that were detoxing from substance abuse?

           10    A.      No.

           11    Q.      At Foundations in Doylestown were there

           12    patients that were detoxing from substance abuse?

           13    A.      I think we only ever had one.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15    A.      We typically didn't accept detoxing children.

           16    And it's also just not common in the population.

           17    Q.      During your nursing training did ever do any

           18    rotations at any drug and alcohol rehabs or detox

           19    centers?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      Where?

           22    A.      In nursing school at Reading we did our

           23    clinicals primarily at Reading Hospital.  And they had

           24    a building just for drug and alcohol and detox.

                                                                      12




            1    Q.      So what percentage of your nursing clinicals

            2    was done at the building with drug and alcohol and

            3    detox?

            4    A.      Not much.  We spent maybe 2 weeks there in

            5    terms of the clinicals, yeah.

            6    Q.      During your -- the nursing rotation, do you

            7    recall any patients at the Reading Hospital drug and

            8    alcohol or detox center that died during withdrawal?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Have you ever worked at any other facilities

           11    for Prime Care?

           12    A.      No.

           13    Q.      When you came to work for Prime Care what

           14    training did you receive?

           15    A.      Specifically from Prime Care there's an

           16    orientation packet with educational material.  And then

           17    there is a 10 day training that you do one-on-one with

           18    the nurses.  It's more of a hands-on learning and

           19    training.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   That 10 day training was that at Bucks

           22    County?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Was that shadowing?

                                                                      13




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      Who did you shadow?

            3    A.      A variety of nurses.

            4    Q.      Other registered nurses?

            5    A.      Correct.

            6    Q.      Do you have a particular position that you

            7    focus on in your employment as a nurse, in other words,

            8    do you handle medical, do you handle intake, do you

            9    handle medication administration?

           10                   MR. NINOSKY:  Now, we're back in

           11    January of '18?

           12                   MR. INSCHO:  Well, let's start with

           13    now.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  Now, I'm the Assistant

           15    Director of Nursing so I primarily deal with staffing

           16    and management issues.  It's not very hands-on anymore.

           17    BY MR. INSCHO:

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   Who did you replace in that position?

           20    A.      My current boss, well, no, the person that

           21    left went away for military leave so him.  There was a

           22    lot of turnaround.  Like he went away for military

           23    leave so I took over his spot.

           24    Q.      So let's go back to January, 2018, did you

                                                                      14




            1    have a particular assignment or position that you did?

            2    A.      Like more often than other days?

            3    Q.      I mean, I don't know, if a nurse works in a

            4    hospital, for example, she may work in the ICU, she may

            5    work in the ER.  I want to know whether you had a

            6    primary area where you worked or exclusive area?

            7    A.      No, I worked in all the positions.

            8    Q.      Okay, what are they?

            9    A.      The dispensary, you can also be on detox

           10    checks where you go around and check on the detoxing

           11    inmates, you can be in intake or you can be on the med

           12    cart.

           13    Q.      Who handles sick call?

           14    A.      All of the nurses.

           15    Q.      On January 27th, 2018, you handled the intake

           16    for Frederick Adami; is that correct?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Does that indicate you were assigned to intake

           19    that day?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      What hours did you work that day?

           22    A.      I believe 6:00 to 2:00 -- 6:00 a.m. to 2:30

           23    p.m.

           24    Q.      I want to go back to the training you

                                                                      15




            1    received.  I asked you what training you received and

            2    you said from Prime Care?

            3    A.      Uh-huh.

            4    Q.      What other training did you receive when you

            5    started at Bucks County Correctional Facility?

            6    A.      Immediately once I started like on my day of

            7    hire, like I said, the orientation packet had

            8    educational material in it about a variety of different

            9    things with corrections and detox and how to work in

           10    corrections, how to work with inmates, things like

           11    that.  And then during the training you learn as you

           12    go.

           13    Q.      And that was the 10 day shadowing of the

           14    registered nurse?

           15    A.      Correct.

           16    Q.      Did you receive any training from anyone else

           17    when you started?

           18    A.      Not -- I'm sorry, yeah, the Medical Director

           19    she teaches us about physicals and detox and other

           20    important things.

           21    Q.      So physicals and detox, what other important

           22    things did the Medical Director instruct you?

           23    A.      Just their different processes on how to do

           24    things.

                                                                      16




            1    Q.      Any other specific things other than physicals

            2    and detox that you think are important things the

            3    Medical Director instructed you?

            4    A.      No.

            5    Q.      Who is the Medical Director?

            6    A.      Doctor Victoria Gessner.

            7    Q.      Is she still the Medical Director?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      And when did she give you the training on

           10    physicals, detox and other important things?

           11    A.      I don't know exactly when it was.  It would

           12    have been around when I started.  I don't remember if

           13    it was exactly in those first 10 days or if it was

           14    within the first few weeks, first months, it's -- I'm

           15    not sure.  It was a long time ago.

           16    Q.      Describe for me what was the training that

           17    Doctor Gessner gave you on medical detox, physicals,

           18    other important things, where did it take place, what

           19    was it?

           20    A.      It would have taken place in the dispensary.

           21    I don't remember exactly what happened but she just

           22    reviews how to do a physical like a health assessment,

           23    things that are important with detox and, you know,

           24    just our different protocols for how to do things

                                                                      17




            1    because it's a jail you have to structure around

            2    security.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Did you receive any training from the

            5    County on security?

            6    A.      No.

            7    Q.      So as I hear the security training you

            8    received and structuring things around security you

            9    received from Doctor Gessner?

           10    A.      It's not about -- she didn't train me on

           11    security.  She trained me on medicine and the jail.

           12    For example, if someone is on suicide watch you're not

           13    going to give them cling for their wounds.  You have to

           14    tailor your medical treatment and interventions around

           15    the jail.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Tell me what medical treatments that

           18    you were trained on were different and tailored because

           19    of a jail.  You gave me an example of suicide watch.

           20    A.      Uh-huh.

           21    Q.      Could you give me other examples that you can

           22    think of where medical treatment is different because

           23    it's taking place in a jail as opposed to another

           24    setting?

                                                                      18




            1    A.      A jail doesn't have pillows so we can't give

            2    people extra pillows.  If there's a security concern

            3    like a safety concern that can trump certain medical

            4    situations.

            5    Q.      As you sit here today, can you tell me some

            6    examples that Doctor Gessner explained to you when she

            7    was training you of how the security concerns would

            8    affect medical care?

            9    A.      Yeah, our psychotropic meds and our narcotics

           10    all have to be opened and crushed because the inmates

           11    have a habit of cheeking their meds, hoarding them,

           12    selling them, things like that.  So she explains why we

           13    have to open and crush them because you don't want them

           14    to overdose or hurt themselves or sell their

           15    medications to someone else and they ultimately hurt

           16    themselves as well.  She explains those processes.

           17    Q.      Can you give me -- can you tell me the other

           18    processes that are different because you are in a jail

           19    facility as opposed to another medical setting?

           20    A.      You can't leave out sharp objects.  You can't

           21    be alone with an inmate, just things like that.  Where

           22    in a hospital or a nursing home, whatever, it's fine if

           23    you leave out a pair of scissors or, you know, it's

           24    fine if you're behind a curtain with a patient so...

                                                                      19




            1    Q.      Are those procedures written down anywhere or

            2    are those -- other than or you got it from Doctor

            3    Gessner?

            4    A.      Doctor Gessner and the other people I trained

            5    with, the other nurses.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   Now, I recognize you really hadn't

            8    worked very much with people detoxing prior to coming

            9    to Bucks County; is that fair?

           10    A.      Correct.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   Can you tell me in what ways, if any,

           13    in your mind detoxing is different because it is taking

           14    place in a jail setting as opposed to another medical

           15    setting?

           16                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to form, you can

           17    answer.

           18                   THE WITNESS:  In a jail setting we

           19    don't have -- in our jail we don't have a medical block

           20    where the inmates are in medical 24/7, they are out in

           21    the jail.  We do have our protocols and everything to

           22    accommodate that.

           23    BY MR. INSCHO:

           24    Q.      Is there any other way in your mind -- well,

                                                                      20




            1    let me rephrase that.

            2                   Is there any other way that Doctor

            3    Gessner explained to you that detoxing which is

            4    something she talked to you about is different because

            5    it takes place in a jail as opposed to another medical

            6    setting?

            7    A.      No.

            8    Q.      You say you don't have a medical block, are

            9    there any cells that are dedicated to medical?

           10    A.      Yeah, the ones that are closer to the

           11    dispensary.  What I mean is that some jails

           12    specifically have a dispensary where the sick or acute

           13    inmates physically stay in the dispensary 24/7 with

           14    nursing 24/7.  We don't have that.  We have our

           15    dispensary and then the blocks that are closest to it

           16    we put certain medical individuals there because

           17    they're closer to us.

           18    Q.      What blocks are close to medical -- I'm sorry,

           19    is there a Medical Department or is the Medical

           20    Department and the dispensary kind of the same?

           21    A.      It is -- the Medical Department is the

           22    dispensary.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   What blocks are closest to the medical

                                                                      21




            1    dispensary?

            2    A.      Golf -- I'm sorry, G and E, Golf and Echo.

            3    Q.      I seen a reference to modules, I think?

            4    A.      Yeah, a block is a module.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Are there any medical personnel that

            7    have constant supervision over G or E block?

            8                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            9                   THE WITNESS:  Constant supervision, I

           10    don't understand what you mean.

           11    BY MR. INSCHO:

           12    Q.      Well, meaning that they don't have to go

           13    through a secured gate to see those cells, that they

           14    can see those cells from where they are normally

           15    working?

           16    A.      No.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   And from the dispensary medical unit

           19    you can't see any cells; is that fair?

           20    A.      Correct.

           21    Q.      And I think what you were referring to is that

           22    some jails have medical blocks where there are medical

           23    personnel are actually on the block and can see into

           24    the cells?

                                                                      22




            1    A.      Yeah.

            2    Q.      Have you had any -- since you started have you

            3    had any further training from Prime Care or -- well,

            4    start there, have you had any further training from

            5    Prime Care?

            6    A.      Yeah, we do online computer training called

            7    Relias and we do training in our monthly staff

            8    meetings.

            9    Q.      Has any of the online training or monthly

           10    staff meetings dealt with since you started detox or

           11    substance abuse?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      And explain to me the monthly staff meetings

           14    are they geared toward a particular topic or are they

           15    just a general topic meeting?

           16    A.      They do have for the educational parts of them

           17    like non-staffing related, whatever.  The educational

           18    parts it is typically a like one specific topic but if

           19    things come up that we're learning about or things that

           20    maybe the nurses don't know or whatever then we still

           21    educate everyone regardless of the topic.

           22    Q.      And with regard to detox and substance abuse

           23    has that been a topic, an educational topic at any of

           24    those meetings -- monthly meetings?

                                                                      23




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      About how many times?

            3    A.      With it officially being the topic we're

            4    talking about I think it's once a year in the staff

            5    meetings.  But again, we do bring things up that, you

            6    know, maybe the nurses struggle with or they don't know

            7    or that we just come across.

            8    Q.      How long are the monthly staff meetings?

            9    A.      About 2 to 3 hours.

           10    Q.      And what part of that is the formal

           11    educational part?

           12    A.      I would say half of it.

           13    Q.      Who does the presentation?

           14    A.      The Director of Nursing.

           15    Q.      Are there materials or Power Point slides or

           16    anything like that used at the trainings?

           17    A.      Yeah, we give handouts and then we go over

           18    them verbally and answer any questions.

           19    Q.      Since you've come into the position of

           20    Assistant -- is it Assistant Director?

           21    A.      Yes, Assistant Director of Nursing.

           22    Q.      Since you became the Assistant Director of

           23    Nursing have you done any educational presentations?

           24    A.      Like have I presented?

                                                                      24




            1    Q.      Yeah, monthly meetings?

            2    A.      No, the Director of Nursing primarily does

            3    them but if there's something I think of that I know

            4    the nurses don't understand or they don't know then

            5    I'll just dive in and tell them and educate them as

            6    well.

            7    Q.      How is it that everyone can attend the

            8    meeting?

            9    A.      It's mandatory so they have to come.

           10    Q.      Do you physically have to be there or do they

           11    record them?

           12    A.      Physically have to be there.

           13    Q.      Are they recorded at all?

           14    A.      No, you mean like video or...

           15    Q.      Yeah.

           16    A.      No, we can't bring that stuff into the

           17    facility.

           18    Q.      So everyone of the -- was it everyone medical

           19    or every nurse, who attends those?

           20    A.      Every nurse has to come.

           21    Q.      What about the rest of the medical staff?

           22    A.      We only have one medical assistant and she's

           23    per diem.  She only works with us maybe once a month.

           24    Q.      Uh-huh.

                                                                      25




            1    A.      She's the only person that's not a nurse.

            2    Q.      What about is there -- does Doctor Gessner

            3    attend those meeting?

            4    A.      Uh-huh, yes, she does.

            5    Q.      And are there -- I saw some reference to

            6    either a certified nurse practitioner or a PA or some

            7    sort of physician extender?

            8    A.      Yeah, they don't always come to the meetings,

            9    it's more for the nurses.

           10    Q.      Do you have to sign in?

           11    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   And who became the Director of Nursing

           19    after Ms. Zernhelt?

           20    A.      I believe it was Jessica Thomas.

           21    Q.      Is Jessica Thomas still the Director of

           22    Nursing?

           23    A.      Yes.

                                                                      26




            1    A.      I don't know.

            2    Q.      Approximately?

            3    A.      Probably 2 years ago.

            4    Q.      2 years ago would be August of 2016?

            5    A.      I have no idea.  I don't know their employment

            6    dates and what dates they changed positions.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8    A.      I don't know, I guess 2 or some years ago she

            9    took over.

           10    Q.      Where did Alynn go?

           11    A.      She's the HSA.

           12    Q.      Help me out, what's that?

           13    A.      Health Services Administrator.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Is that the position above the Director

           16    of Nursing?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   Who was the Health Service

           20    Administrator when you started?

           21    A.      Joe Lynch.

           22    Q.      And where is Mr. Lynch is he still employed?

           23    A.      He works for Prime Care at Montgomery County

           24    Corrections.

                                                                      27




            1    Q.      When did he stop being the HSA?

            2    A.      Approximately 2 years ago, I guess.

            3    Q.      So approximately 2 years ago Mr. Lynch left

            4    and then Ms. Zernhelt was promoted and Ms. Thomas came

            5    into the Director of Nursing role; is that right?

            6    A.      Correct, yes.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   And you told me that in November of

            9    last year there was some turnover that led to you being

           10    promoted; is that accurate?

           11    A.      Correct, the ADON went away for military leave

           12    for a year.

           13    Q.      Is he the only one that left at that time?

           14    A.      Yes.

           15    Q.      Who was the ADON when you started?

           16    A.      Rachel Onate, O-N-A-T-E.

           17    Q.      I'm sorry, give it to me again, O?

           18    A.      O-N-A-T-E.

           19    Q.      And when did Ms. Onate leave?

           20    A.      Maybe a year into me being there.

           21    Q.      And then someone else became the --

           22    A.      Then Jessica became the ADON.  So everyone has

           23    been shifting upward.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      28




            1                   And then when Jessica moved up about 2

            2    years ago --

            3    A.      Uh-huh.

            4    Q.      -- who took over as the Assistant Director of

            5    Nursing then?

            6    A.      David Barthold, B-A-R-T-H-O-L-D.  He's the one

            7    on military leave now.

            8    Q.      As far as management on the nursing side goes

            9    are those the main -- are those the positions, the HSA,

           10    the Director of Nursing and the Assistant Director of

           11    Nursing?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   No other administrative positions?

           15    A.      No.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Is there anyone else that has held any

           18    of those three administrative positions since you've

           19    been there that we haven't talked about?

           20    A.      No.

           21    Q.      Have you ever had any training since you came

           22    to Prime Care from any outside source other than the

           23    online training?

           24    A.      Just my continuing education for my license.

                                                                      29




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Do you do that on your own or is that

            3    something that's sponsored through Prime Care?

            4    A.      It's on our own.

            5    Q.      In other words, you can choose kind of

            6    whatever classes you want?

            7    A.      Correct.

            8    Q.      The online training we didn't talk about, how

            9    often do you do that?

           10    A.      It's monthly.  It just started probably 6

           11    months ago.

           12    Q.      Was there any similar online training or

           13    training that it replaced 6 months ago?

           14    A.      No.

           15    Q.      Does that have any -- strike that.

           16                   Has any of the online training dealt

           17    with substance abuse or detox?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Tell me about the online training?

           21    A.      It is typically either a video or slideshow.

           22    It's very interactive and it focuses on a topic then

           23    you have to take a quiz afterwards and pass it.  We

           24    have to do it every month.  I think it's about 3 or 4

                                                                      30




            1    courses every month that you have to do.

            2    Q.      How long are the courses?

            3    A.      They can take anywhere from a half hour to 2

            4    hours.

            5    Q.      And do you do that at work or do you do it at

            6    home?

            7    A.      At work.

            8    Q.      Explain to me how that works is there like

            9    dedicated time in the month, in the shift, how do you

           10    do that?

           11    A.      Yeah, we have to make our own dedicated time.

           12    Q.      What does that mean?

           13    A.      We have to find time and prioritize and things

           14    like that.  I'm a manager so it's different for me than

           15    the nurses.  The nurses can stay late after their shift

           16    or they're done all of their work they can do it or

           17    whatever works for them or you can do it at home if you

           18    want to.  I'll do it around the work that I do at my

           19    desk.

           20    Q.      And did you tell me was there a company that

           21    runs those?

           22    A.      It's called Relias.

           23    Q.      Can you spell that?

           24    A.      R-E-L-I-A-S.

                                                                      31




            1    Q.      Have any of those trainings specifically dealt

            2    with detox or drug abuse?

            3    A.      Yes.

            4    Q.      Is there a detox protocol at Bucks County

            5    Correctional Facility?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      Is it in writing?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Who trained you on the detox protocol?

           10    A.      It's in our -- when we are hired the

           11    educational material they give us in orientation it's

           12    in there, the entire detox protocol.

           13    Q.      You say the entire, how long is it?

           14    A.      A few pages.

           15                   MR. NINOSKY:  The education material or

           16    the protocol?

           17                   THE WITNESS:  The protocol is a few

           18    pages.  The educational material is quite -- it's a

           19    lot.

           20    BY MR. INSCHO:

           21    Q.      Other than being given it when you get your

           22    educational materials where is it maintained?

           23    A.      What do you mean?

           24    Q.      I mean, is it on the computer, is it in a

                                                                      32




            1    binder, policies, where is it kept?

            2    A.      Yeah, our policies are always on the computer.

            3    They're also in every are of medical.  So they have

            4    them in intake, the have them in the dispensary,

            5    they're in the med room, they're in all of our offices.

            6    Q.      During your time have there been any changes

            7    to the detox protocol?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      What changes can you tell me were made to the

           10    detox protocol during your time?

           11                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           12    can answer.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  They added a different

           14    form to use in the computer for opiate detox called the

           15    COWS form.  It's a clinical opiate withdrawal scale.

           16    We have to give Gatorade to everyone that's detoxing.

           17    BY MR. INSCHO:

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   And is the COWS score generated

           20    starting at intake?

           21    A.      No, it's when you do your detox checks.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Is it for all detox checks?

           24    A.      It's for the opiate detox so...

                                                                      33




            1    Q.      Oh, right, well, COWS is only for opiates?

            2    A.      Correct.

            3    Q.      But I'm saying is it for everyone of the

            4    subsequent detox checks after intake?

            5    A.      Oh, yes, uh-huh, for every single detox -- for

            6    every single opiate detox check you do you have to do a

            7    COWS score.

            8    Q.      Who trained you on how to do a COWS score?

            9    A.      I don't remember exactly who trained us on it.

           10    It was awhile ago that it started.  I don't remember

           11    the exact person.

           12    Q.      When did it start?

           13    A.      I'm not sure, maybe a year or 2 ago.

           14    Q.      2000 -- did it start in 2018?

           15    A.      I believe it was 2018 sometime.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Was the opiate detox utilizing a COWS

           18    score at the time of Fred Adami's death?

           19    A.      I don't believe we had it then.

           20    Q.      Is the COWS score done on the computer?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   You told me you can't remember exactly

           24    who trained you, was it someone from outside Prime

                                                                      34




            1    Care, was it from inside Prime Care, did you have

            2    someone come in?

            3    A.      It would have been someone within Prime Care

            4    like Doctor Gessner or the HSA.  I don't remember

            5    exactly who it was.

            6    Q.      When was the training on how to use a COWS

            7    score?

            8    A.      I don't remember.  It would have been before

            9    we implemented it though.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Where did it take place, did it take

           12    place as part of a meeting or was it -- one of the

           13    monthly meetings or was it something special?

           14    A.      I don't remember exactly.  It very likely

           15    would have been one of the monthly meetings.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Who attended -- was it all done at once

           18    the whole nursing staff attended?

           19    A.      All of our nursing staff attends all of the

           20    monthly meetings so...

           21    Q.      I understand that but I just want to make sure

           22    that the COWS score training was something that all the

           23    nurses attended at the same time?

           24    A.      I believe so.

                                                                      35




            1    Q.      Had you ever prior to that training utilize

            2    the COWS score?

            3    A.      No.

            4    Q.      Did you have any tool -- strike that.

            5                   Did Prime Care utilize any tool for

            6    assessing severity of detox prior to the COWS score?

            7                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  In where you document

            9    when you're seeing someone for detox and you're

           10    documenting it it's a flow sheet where you put their

           11    vitals and their symptoms that they have.

           12    BY MR. INSCHO:

           13    Q.      I understand you enter that information.  Was

           14    there prior to the utilization of COWS score any

           15    measurement of the severity utilizing those symptoms?

           16    A.      Not a measurement, no.

           17    Q.      A COWS score we're talking about the same

           18    thing, you look at someone's flesh, for example, if

           19    they have, you know, the goose bumpy flesh that it gets

           20    so many points and then you add that up; is that right?

           21    A.      Correct.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Anything like that with points and

           24    scoring, any objective tool used?

                                                                      36




            1    A.      No.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   Are you aware that in 2013 a woman by

            4    the name of -- I'm going to butcher this -- Karaharisis

            5    died at Bucks County Correctional Facility apparently

            6    due to sudden death during heroin withdrawal?

            7                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

            8    can answer if you know.

            9                   THE WITNESS:  I'm aware that it

           10    occurred.  I don't know the details.

           11    BY MR. INSCHO:

           12    Q.      When did you learn that someone had died back

           13    in 2013 at Bucks County from heroin withdrawal?

           14                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  I don't know when I

           16    learned about it, just at some point.  I think I saw it

           17    in the newspaper.

           18    BY MR. INSCHO:

           19    Q.      Before or after you started working there?

           20    A.      After.

           21    Q.      Before or after Mr. Adami's death?

           22    A.      I don't know.

           23    Q.      What newspaper did you read?

           24    A.      Just the online ones, the online versions of

                                                                      37




            1    them like the Intelligencer, things like that.

            2    Q.      What's the Intelligencer?

            3    A.      I believe it's a Doylestown or Bucks County

            4    one.

            5    Q.      Were you aware that a woman named Yarnall dies

            6    while going through heroin withdrawal at Bucks County

            7    prison in 2014?

            8                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            9                   THE WITNESS:  No.

           10    BY MR. INSCHO:

           11    Q.      You didn't learn about the fact that two women

           12    had died at Bucks County prison during heroin

           13    withdrawal?

           14    A.      No.

           15                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           16    BY MR. INSCHO:

           17    Q.      Could you tell me what the medical staffing is

           18    of the department on a particular day, like take me

           19    through how many nurses are there during what shifts?

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  Today or in January of

           21    '18?

           22    BY MR. INSCHO:

           23    Q.      Why don't we start with January of '18 that's

           24    fine.

                                                                      38




            1    A.      On a morning shift it would be one nurse in

            2    the intake department, in the dispensary there would be

            3    two nurses dedicated to the dispensary, one nurse or

            4    medical assistant assigned to go to the block to do

            5    detox checks and then one nurse on the medication cart.

            6    Q.      You said you had one medical assistant, what

            7    role do they perform?

            8    A.      They just do vitals and detox checks.

            9    Q.      So the medical assistant never does intake,

           10    work the dispensary or the med cart?

           11    A.      They rarely work intake but that's it.

           12    Q.      So during the morning shift and that's 6:00 to

           13    2:30?

           14    A.      Uh-huh, yes.

           15    Q.      You have five personnel there, maybe all

           16    nurses, maybe one medical assistant?

           17    A.      Correct.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   And then what's the afternoon shift?

           20    A.      It would be the same thing.  For 2:00 p.m. to

           21    10:00 p.m. it would have been the same exact layout.

           22    Q.      And after 10:00?

           23    A.      From 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. it's one nurse in

           24    intake and one nurse in the dispensary and that's it.

                                                                      39




            1    Q.      Is that different today?

            2    A.      We had more medical assistants at the time but

            3    we don't really have them anymore.  We just have one

            4    and like I said, she only works like once a month.  And

            5    we just keep her primarily on detox checks and vitals,

            6    that's it.

            7    Q.      Are the same positions, five personnel on

            8    morning and afternoon shift and two overnight is that

            9    the same?

           10    A.      Approximately, yeah, if we can -- I mean, if

           11    we can get more than two people in the dispensary we

           12    will do that.  But minimum is two people in the

           13    dispensary.

           14    Q.      How many in 2018, January, how many medical

           15    assistants were there?

           16    A.      One.

           17    Q.      You told me just a moment ago you used to have

           18    more medical assistants and now you only have one.  I

           19    just want to understand that?

           20    A.      We used to have a second one and she quit and

           21    Prime Care just doesn't really hire medical assistants

           22    anymore.  So the one that we had consistently from that

           23    time is grandfathered in.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      40




            1                   And the second medical assistant quit

            2    before January of 2018; is that right?

            3    A.      Yes, correct.

            4    Q.      When is there -- strike that.

            5                   I asked before about physician

            6    extenders, are you familiar with that term?

            7    A.      No.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Are there any PA's that work at the

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Are there any certified nurse

           14    practitioners?

           15    A.      Just some that fill in when the PA's are --

           16    like if they're on vacation or sick.

           17    Q.      When are there PA's at the facility?

           18    A.      Monday through Friday approximately 8:00 a.m.

           19    to 3:00 p.m.

           20    Q.      And that position would sometimes be filled by

           21    a certified nurse practitioner filling in; is that

           22    right?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      41




            1                   And when is the Medical Director there?

            2    A.      Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

            3    Q.      Other than that are there any other physicians

            4    that are at the jail?

            5                   MR. NINOSKY:  Outside of psychiatrists?

            6                   MR. INSCHO:  Yeah, outside of

            7    psychiatrist.

            8                   THE WITNESS:  Just the dentist.

           10    Q.      What hours is the Medical Director there

           11    Monday, Wednesday, Friday?

           13    Q.      You've acted in the -- you performed the role

           14    of doing the med cart; is that right?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      As well as performing the detox checks?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      On the morning of January 28th you responded

           19    to the module I believe it was A where Mr. Adami was

           20    being held and was unconscious in his cell; is that

           21    correct?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      What was your position that morning?

                                                                      42




            1    Q.      Were there any physicians or PA's at the

            2    hospital at that time -- I'm sorry, strike that.

            3                   Were there any physicians or PA's at

            4    the jail at the time of Mr. Adami's emergency?

            5    A.      No.

            6                   MR. INSCHO:  Let's take a quick break.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Okay.

            8                   THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record,

           11                   (Whereupon, a brief break was taken at

           12    this time.)

           14                   THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on at

           15    11:15.

           16    By MR. INSCHO:

           17    Q.      Will you agree with me that there's a large

           18    number of inmates coming into Bucks County that have

           19    substance abuse problems?

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           21    can answer if you have an understanding.

           22                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           23    BY MR. INSHCO:

           24    Q.      And you've observed that in your time there?

                                                                      43




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      Are most of the inmates that you see in intake

            3    that have substance abuse problems have issues with

            4    opioids?

            5                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form but

            6    you can answer if you have an understanding.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            8    BY MR. INSCHO:

            9    Q.      Are most of the inmates that come through

           10    intake withdrawing from some sort of substance whether

           11    it be drugs or alcohol?

           12                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           13    can answer.

           14                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           15    BY MR. INSCHO:

           16    Q.      Can you estimate the percentage of people you

           17    see at intake that are opioid users?

           18                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.  If

           19    you can give him an estimate, that's fine, just don't

           20    guess.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I have no idea.

           22    BY MR. INSCHO:

           23    Q.      More than half?

           24    A.      I believe so.

                                                                      44




            1    Q.      Do you know if Prime Care keeps track of that?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      That was a bad question, does Prime Care keep

            4    track of that?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      What percentage of the individuals that you

            7    see when you're in intake are placed on the withdrawal

            8    protocol?

            9                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           10    can answer if you have an understanding.

           11                   THE WITNESS:  Anyone that is -- I mean,

           12    I don't know a percentage but it would be for anyone

           13    that's abusing any kind of substances.

           14    BY MR. INSCHO:

           15    Q.      Do you have separate withdrawal protocols for

           16    opiates and other substances?

           17    A.      The only difference is the medication that

           18    would be given.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   That wasn't my question.  My question

           21    was is there -- you described we've been talking about

           22    a detox protocol?

           23    A.      Uh-huh.

           24    Q.      Is the detox protocol is there one for

                                                                      45




            1    opiates, one for Benzo's, one for alcohol or is there a

            2    single protocol?

            3    A.      The only difference is that for opiates we now

            4    use the COWS form.  Besides that, no, it's all the

            5    same.

            6    Q.      Is it the same -- is the protocol itself the

            7    same document?

            8    A.      Yes, but it's because people are typically not

            9    just using one substance they are typically using more

           10    than one so that's why.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   And at intake are -- would you say that

           13    more than half the people that you see at intake are

           14    placed into the detox protocol?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           17    BY MR. INSCHO:

           18    Q.      More than three quarters?

           19                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           20                   THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

           21    BY MR. INSCHO:

           22    Q.      What about the breakdown of men and women is

           23    it about the same for men and women?

           24    A.      There's more men than women there so I don't

                                                                      46




            1    know the breakdown of how many are detoxing versus not.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   I guess my question is is there a

            4    greater percentage of women as compared to men that are

            5    placed into the detox protocol?

            6    A.      I don't know.

            7    Q.      Do you as the Assistant Director of Nursing

            8    keep track of any metrics?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Who does that?

           11    A.      The HSA.

           12    Q.      And does Prime Care keep track of the number

           13    of individuals who are placed into the withdrawal

           14    protocol?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      In your time at the Bucks County Correctional

           17    Facility has the number of new entries suffering from

           18    opioid addiction increased?

           19    A.      In my opinion, yes.  I don't know about the

           20    actual numbers.

           21    Q.      Okay, I'm asking about your observations.

           22    A.      Uh-huh, yes.

           23    Q.      Are you given any information about the new

           24    entries underlying criminal issues that brought them

                                                                      47




            1    into the jail?

            2    A.      No, only if it's relevant to what we're going

            3    to see, you know, if they did something that would

            4    affect their medical care, that's it.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Who makes the decision whether or not

            7    to place a patient into the opiate or I'm sorry, into

            8    the drug detox protocol?

            9    A.      It's automatically generated when you complete

           10    their intake forms and then the on-call provider

           11    officially orders it as well.

           12    Q.      When you say on-call provider who are you

           13    talking about?

           14    A.      If there isn't a PA or doctor present then you

           15    have to call a provider like a PA or doctor or nurse

           16    practitioner that's on-call.

           17    Q.      Do you have to have an actual phone call?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      And you say they're automatically -- it's

           20    automatically generated.  Explain to me what is it that

           21    needs to be automatically generated?

           22    A.      Everything is computerized in our charting so

           23    when you say that someone is abusing any substance and

           24    you then save the form it automatically creates tasks

                                                                      48




            1    for detox checks, for the PA's to assess them.  So it

            2    just automatically does it.

            3    Q.      How long are detox checks performed?

            4    A.      Approximately 10 days.  It could be lengthened

            5    if needed.

            6    Q.      Is that the default?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      How many times a day are detox checks done?

            9    A.      Twice a day.

           10    Q.      When?

           11    A.      First shift and second shift.

           12    Q.      Will you agree with me that opioid withdrawal

           13    can pose a serious risk to an inmate's health?

           14                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           15    can answer if you have an understanding.

           16                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           17    BY MR. INSCHO:

           18    Q.      You agree with me that extreme fatigue can be

           19    a symptom of opiate withdrawal?

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           21    can answer if you have an understanding.

           22                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           23    BY MR. INSCHO:

           24    Q.      Tell me what the symptoms of opiate withdrawal

                                                                      49




            1    are?

            2    A.      Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, goose bumps, upset

            3    stomach, abnormal vital signs.  And yeah, those are the

            4    general ones.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Are chills and hot/cold sweats is that

            7    a symptom associated with opiate withdrawal?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      What about muscle pain and joint pain?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      What about dehydration is that a symptom

           12    associated with opiate withdrawal?

           13                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form,

           14    that's a condition.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, that's not a

           16    symptom of opiate withdrawal.  That could be a result

           17    of it.

           18                   MR. INSCHO:  Fair.

           19    BY MR. INSCHO:

           20    Q.      Do you have an understanding as to when after

           21    a last opiate use acute withdrawal typically begins?

           22                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           23                   THE WITNESS:  It depends on the person.

           24    It depends on their usage.  It depends on their

                                                                      50




            1    metabolism.  It depends of how long they've been using.

            2    It's a variety of things.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   Is there an average in your mind?

            6                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  No, again, it depends on

            8    the person.  Everybody is different.

            9    BY MR. INSCHO:

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   How long can acute withdrawal last?

           12    A.      Again, it depends on the person.

           13    Q.      Give me a range?

           14                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           15                   THE WITNESS:  I don't know.

           16    BY MR. INSCHO:

           17    Q.      Will you agree with me that patients going

           18    through opiate withdrawal need to be monitored?

           19                   Yes.

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  I think you're starting

           21    to ask for expert opinion but she answered your

           22    question.

           23    BY MR. INSCHO:

           24    Q.      You told me about Gatorade and a COWS score.

                                                                      51




            1    Have there been any other changes to the detox protocol

            2    since you've been there?

            3                   MR. NINOSKY:  That's been asked and

            4    answered but you can answer it again.

            5                   THE WITNESS:  Not that I can recall.

            6    BY MR. INSCHO:

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   Was the Gatorade and the COWS score was

            9    that started at the same time?

           10    A.      I don't remember.

           11    Q.      When did you start giving the individual's

           12    Gatorade?

           13    A.      I don't remember.  I believe it's been within

           14    the past year.

           15    Q.      COWS score was in '18.  The Gatorade was

           16    sometime in the past year; does that sound right?

           17    A.      I think so.  I don't know the exact dates.

           18    Q.      Describe for me, and first of all, let me say

           19    that we're having this deposition today to accommodate

           20    you so I don't have the benefit of having the

           21    withdrawal protocol in writing in front of me.  So I'm

           22    going to ask you questions about it and that's why I'm

           23    asking.  If I had it I wouldn't probably ask you some

           24    of these questions.  But can you just describe for me

                                                                      52




            1    what the withdrawal protocol sets out?

            2                   MR. NINOSKY:  She said there's been a

            3    couple of changes.  You want it for January of '18, I

            4    presume.

            5                   MR. INSCHO:  Yeah, well, other than the

            6    COWS score and the Gatorade that's it, everything else

            7    would be the same, right?

            8                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I believe so.

            9    BY MR. INSCHO:

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   So let's leave those out and tell me

           12    what the protocol was before and it would be the same

           13    today except for those two exceptions?

           14    A.      They automatically get put on a medical watch

           15    that involves them being checked every 30 minutes by

           16    the officer or by an inmate monitor.  They get checked

           17    for detox checks twice a day which is orthostatic

           18    vitals, weight, their symptoms.  And they see the

           19    physician assistant.  They're scheduled to see the

           20    physician assistant three times.  And there are certain

           21    medication papers that the providers will order

           22    depending on the substance that's being used.

           23    Q.      What else?

           24    A.      Those are the initial -- those are the ones

                                                                      53




            1    that we look for and that happened.

            2    Q.      The medical watch is being performed by guards

            3    and inmate monitors, correct?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      So while it's described as a medical watch

            6    it's actually the security staff that's doing it; is

            7    that right?

            8    A.      Correct.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   Are you aware of any training provided

           11    to the security staff or the monitoring of patients

           12    going through detox?

           13    A.      I believe they get training.  I don't know

           14    specifically what it entails but I do believe they get

           15    training on it.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   And during the times when detox checks

           18    aren't being performed they're -- or the med cart isn't

           19    there generally there's no medical provider on the

           20    module; is that right?

           21    A.      Correct.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   When you go to see -- strike that.

           24                   Are there any other rounds performed by

                                                                      54




            1    medical providers on the blocks?

            2    A.      Yes, we have segregation rounds where the

            3    nurses go around to all the locked inmates and ask them

            4    about their needs, if they feel safe, if they have any

            5    medical concerns at all.  So the nurses do go around to

            6    blocks once a day to do those.

            7    Q.      What blocks have segregation?

            8    A.      R, H, U, M, H, U, A, E and G.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10    A.      And the farm.

           11    Q.      What shift are those performed on?

           12    A.      It changes depending on our protocol -- not

           13    protocol but at that time I believe it was second shift

           14    that does them, 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

           15    Q.      And whose job is that?

           16    A.      At that time I believe it was -- it's changed

           17    a few times.  It was -- I believe it was the medication

           18    nurse.

           19    Q.      Who else, what other positions have done the

           20    segregation checks?

           21    A.      The detox nurse, not the MA, but the nurse

           22    would have done it.

           23    Q.      In medical you're relying on the guards to

           24    provide you with any information during the non-detox

                                                                      55




            1    check time; is that correct?

            2    A.      Yes, they communicate any medical concerns at

            3    all with us.

            4    Q.      You're relying on them to do that, correct?

            5                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form but

            6    you can answer.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  Yes, and there is a sick

            8    call process for the inmates.

            9    BY MR. INSCHO:

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11    A.      So it's not relying on the officers because

           12    that would be an access to care issue.  They also have

           13    the sick call process that they can use, the inmates

           14    can.

           15    Q.      Well, the monitoring part is relying on the

           16    officers?

           17    A.      Yes, that's just monitoring but if they have

           18    any, you know, complaints, you know, they don't want to

           19    tell the officers or they want it to be more private

           20    they have an entire sick call process where they can

           21    report any issues to us.

           22    Q.      And this is for every inmate; is that right?

           23    A.      Yes, uh-huh.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      56




            1                   We're talking about nothing special for

            2    detox inmates for sick call process, correct?

            3    A.      It's for everybody so if they have any issues

            4    with detox they can utilize the system.

            5    Q.      There's nothing special for detox inmates in

            6    the sick call process, correct?

            7                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            8    BY MR. INSCHO:

            9    Q.      They don't have a separate process if you're

           10    on detox that you have to do the same thing to get to

           11    see someone, correct?

           12    A.      Yes, you do the same thing.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   There is a special monitoring watch

           15    that occurs for detox inmates, correct?

           16                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           17    can answer.

           18                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           19    BY MR. INSCHO:

           20    Q.      That is not for everyone in the jail, it's for

           21    people going through detox; is that right?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   For that you're relying on the security

                                                                      57




            1    staff, correct?

            2                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

            3    can answer.

            4                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            5    BY MR. INSCHO:

            6    Q.      That monitoring occurs independent of the sick

            7    call process, correct?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      What are the medications prescribed for opiate

           10    withdrawal?

           11    A.      At that time it was Vistaril, Motrin, Zofran

           12    and Pepto.

           13    Q.      Has that changed?

           14    A.      You could also give Tylenol III, too, if it

           15    was indicated.  The only thing that's changed since

           16    then is you can still do those same medications or you

           17    can do different medications as well.

           18    Q.      What are the different medications?

           19    A.      Instead of the Vistaril one that you wrote

           20    down it would be Clonidine, Zofran, Motrin and Pepto.

           21    Q.      Was Clonidine available at the Bucks County

           22    Correctional Facility in January of 2018?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      It just wasn't part of the protocol?

                                                                      58




            1    A.      Yes, correct.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   It's been added to the protocol?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   So that's another change that's

            7    happened since Mr. Adami's death; is that right?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      When was Clonidine added?

           10    A.      I don't know.

           11    Q.      Can you estimate for me?

           12    A.      I really have no idea.

           13    Q.      Sometime since January -- between January,

           14    2018 and today?

           15    A.      I really don't remember if it was before or

           16    after his death.  They use it more primarily now but I

           17    don't know when it was officially added.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   You said Tylenol III if indicated; is

           20    that right?

           21    A.      Yes, if the PA decides to order it or the

           22    provider decides to order it.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   Do you as the nurse filling out the

                                                                      59




            1    protocol have any role in the selection of what

            2    medications?

            3    A.      No.

            4    Q.      When does the PA see the inmate to determine

            5    what medications to prescribe?

            6                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to form.

            7                   THE WITNESS:  When we call for orders

            8    they give us the medications that they want to order.

            9    BY MR. INSCHO:

           10    Q.      When do they see them prior to prescribing

           11    medications?

           12                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  They don't see them

           14    before ordering the medications.  If someone comes in

           15    on intake I see them -- the nurse sees them.  We

           16    eventually get orders from the provider.  And they

           17    could see them the next day.  Either way they're not

           18    going to not give meds.  We order meds on intake.

           19    BY MR. INSCHO:

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   The Vistaril -- going back to January

           22    of 2018, the Vistaril, the Motrin, the Zofran and the

           23    Pepto-Bismol are they automatically populated as far as

           24    an order?

            1    A.      If the provider orders it then yes, it's a set

            2    medication taper for them.  Like it's already in the

            3    computer.  You just click this taper and it generates

            4    it for you.

            5    Q.      What's that taper called?

            6    A.      The opiate Vistaril taper.

            7    Q.      And now is there an opiate Clonidine taper?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      And what about the Tylenol III is that

           10    something that's just added?

           11    A.      It's still -- it's been there for a long time.

           12    It's still there if the providers want to order it.

           13    Q.      You described there's an order set under the

           14    protocol for the Vistaril opiate taper, correct?

           15    A.      Yes, the Tylenol III is a totally separate

           16    taper.

           17    Q.      Is it part of any other order set or is it

           18    just an individual medication?

           19    A.      It's its own individual medication.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   Do you as the intake nurse who actually

           22    saw the patient make a recommendation as to whether or

           23    not the patient should be on the Clonidine taper or the

           24    Vistaril taper or needs the Tylenol III taper?

                                                                      61




            1                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            2                   THE WITNESS:  The only recommendations

            3    we would make is if something is contraindicated, you

            4    know, like they have an allergy to Vistaril or

            5    something like that or Clonidine can drop your blood

            6    pressure very low so if you already have low blood

            7    pressure we would tell the provider and they wouldn't

            8    order that because it's unsafe, that's it.  Otherwise,

            9    we're not doctors or providers.

           10    BY MR. INSCHO:

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   So if I understand it you don't make

           13    any recommendations for what taper should be used?

           14    A.      No, that's up to the provider.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   So all you do is provide information to

           17    the provider; is that right?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Does Prime Care prescribe any

           21    Methadone?

           22    A.      Sometimes.

           23    Q.      Does it prescribe any Suboxone?

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                      62




            1    Q.      Are there any other tapers or order sets

            2    utilized for individuals who are going through opiate

            3    withdrawal?

            4    A.      No.

            5    Q.      What other substance tapers are there?

            6    A.      There's an alcohol detox taper and there's a

            7    Benzodiazepine taper.

            8    Q.      Are there guidelines in the protocol for when

            9    to contact a higher level provider than yourself?

           10    A.      On intake or during -- when?

           11    Q.      I meant the detox protocol.  Does the detox

           12    protocol provide any guidelines or directions for when

           13    to contact a higher level provider?

           14    A.      I'm not sure.

           15    Q.      Does the detox protocol provide any guidelines

           16    for when the guards who are conducting the monitoring

           17    should contact the medical department?

           18    A.      No, because they're corrections.  Our

           19    protocols are for medical.

           20    Q.      So the administration of the actual monitoring

           21    by the security and the inmate monitors is handled by

           22    the County Correctional staff; is that fair?

           23    A.      I believe so, yes.

           24    Q.      As the Director of Nursing are you aware of

                                                                      63




            1    anything from Prime Care that directs how that

            2    monitoring should be done?

            3                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

            4    can answer if you can.

            5                   THE WITNESS:  For the officers?

            6    BY MR. INSCHO:

            7    Q.      For the officers?

            8    A.      I'm not sure.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   If the patient needs emergency medical

           11    care related to detoxification can they be sent to the

           12    emergency room?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      Who makes the decision to send someone to the

           15    emergency room?

           16    A.      The provider.

           17    Q.      When you say that term what do you mean?

           18    A.      The nurse has to assess the situation and if

           19    the provider is there they would see the patient and

           20    make that determination.  If they are not there then

           21    the nurse would have to relay the information to the

           22    provider.

           23    Q.      So by provider you mean a PA?

           24    A.      PA, Doctor Gessner, whoever is on-call, it can

                                                                      64




            1    be a nurse practitioner, a doctor or a PA.

            2    Q.      You conducted the intake for Frederick Adami.

            3    I want to talk about that intake for a couple moments.

            4                   Do you have an independent recollection

            5    of meeting Frederick Adami that morning?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      Tell me what your independent recollection is

            8    other than the records?

            9    A.      Can you clarify?

           10    Q.      Yeah, so I take it you probably reviewed

           11    medical records.  I should have asked you this before.

           12    You reviewed the medical records?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      Before you came in today?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      Did you review the entire chart?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Did you review the statement?

           19    A.      The statement?

           20    Q.      The statement you made, the handwritten

           21    statement?

           22    A.      What handwritten statement, I'm sorry.

           23    Q.      Well, if you look like that you probably

           24    didn't review one.

                                                                      65




            1    A.      I'm sorry.

            2    Q.      Did you review any videotape of Frederick

            3    Adami?

            4    A.      No.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Did you -- other than your Counsel did

            7    you speak to anyone else about your deposition here

            8    today?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   Other than the medical records did you

           12    look at any other documents?

           13    A.      No.

           14    Q.      Did you review the opiate or drug detox

           15    protocol before you came in today?

           16    A.      No.

           17    Q.      Did you review any policies and procedures

           18    before you came in today?

           19    A.      No.

           20    Q.      So in preparation for your deposition the only

           21    document you looked at were the medical records; is

           22    that fair?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Independent of what you see in the medical

                                                                      66




            1    records what is your memory of Frederick Adami?

            2    A.      From his intake?

            3    Q.      From his intake, yeah, not the emergency,

            4    we'll talk about that later.

            5    A.      I just remember doing his intake.  He came in,

            6    he was -- he was tired which is typical of that time of

            7    morning and for new intakes.  And we made it through

            8    the intake.  He was -- he was -- I don't know what

            9    you're looking for specifically.

           10    Q.      Well, I have the medical records you generated

           11    that day --

           12    A.      Right.

           13    Q.      -- I want to know what else you're going to

           14    say about your memory of that interaction?

           15    A.      He was calm, he was cooperative, he was -- he

           16    -- I don't know, he was forthcoming with his

           17    information.  He was able to communicate well.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   Anything else?

           20    A.      I don't know what you're looking for, I'm

           21    sorry.

           22    Q.      Well, I'm looking for if you were asked the

           23    question by your Counsel at trial what do you remember

           24    that's not in the medical records I'm looking for what

                                                                      67




            1    your answer would be?

            2    A.      Not in the medical records, no, nothing

            3    unusual.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   What was he wearing?

            6    A.      He could have been wearing his yellow jumper.

            7    He could have been wearing his street clothes.  It

            8    depends on what part of the process the officers went

            9    through first.

           10                   MR. NINOSKY:  So he's asking you if you

           11    specifically remember.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  No, I don't know.

           13    BY MR. INSCHO:

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Is there anything else you remember

           16    specifically about him that you learned during that

           17    intake that you wouldn't put in your medical records?

           18    A.      No.

           19    Q.      All right.

           20                   So I'm going to show you some

           21    documents.  These are medical records that appear to

           22    have been printed out on April 9th, 2018 and we've

           23    marked this as P-1.

           24                   Did you have an opportunity to review

                                                                      68




            1    this before your deposition today?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   And if we look about middle of the way

            5    down the page Bates numbered P000021 we'll see there is

            6    a line entry which has your maiden name, Samantha

            7    Dunfee at 10:35 a.m.; do you see that?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   Would that have been the first entry

           11    you would have made with regard to Mr. Adami?

           12    A.      It could have been.  It depends on the person,

           13    what their needs are.  I might have done the vital

           14    signs for him first.  I might have done the receiving

           15    screening first.  I don't know exactly which order I

           16    went in.

           17    Q.      So you don't remember whether you did the

           18    intake part first and then the vital signs?

           19    A.      I don't know which was -- yeah, I don't know

           20    which -- if I went through the questions first or the

           21    vitals first.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   MR. NINOSKY:  And Dave, it looks to me

           24    like pre-suit what was produced to you was the full

                                                                      69




            1    patient history.  And what I produced to you was the

            2    full patient history and also the chart which is the

            3    same information just in a different format.

            4                   MR. INSCHO:  Well, like I said, I'll

            5    review what you produced today and we'll try to figure

            6    it out.

            7                   MR. NINOSKY:  Well, that's my

            8    representation to you and if you find something that's

            9    different I'm sure you'll bring it to my attention but

           10    I doubt that will occur.

           11                   MR. INSCHO:  Okay.

           12    BY MR. INSCHO:

           13    Q.      The information that we see here entered at

           14    10:35 a.m. would that have been the time you entered it

           15    in the computer?

           16    A.      For this form, yes.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   When do you do the entry into the form,

           19    do you do it during the intake --

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      -- or after?

           22    A.      During.

           23    Q.      What about the vital signs how are they

           24    entered?

                                                                      70




            1    A.      I typically -- my usual routine is the patient

            2    comes in I get their weight, have them sit down or I'm

            3    sorry, I have them come in, sign the consent forms,

            4    review the sick call process form, the educational form

            5    about opiate withdrawal and things like that, get their

            6    weight and then get their vitals and I'll write all

            7    that down.  And then I'll typically do this receiving

            8    screening form.  As they're there I ask the questions

            9    while they're there.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   When you say write all that down, what

           12    do you mean?

           13    A.      Write down their vitals so I can get started

           14    on asking the questions.

           15    Q.      My question is do you literally write them

           16    down?

           17    A.      Yeah, I literally write them down so that I

           18    have them for when I'm getting orders later and I'll

           19    enter them into the computer.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   So what do you write them on?

           22    A.      A piece of paper.

           23    Q.      Do you have a note pad, do you have --

           24    A.      Yeah, a note pad or sometimes I would take a

                                                                      71




            1    half a sheet of paper, a bunch of them, and staple them

            2    together and write the person's information, their

            3    vitals, what their medical concerns are that I need

            4    orders for.  That way when I call the provider I have

            5    everything all in one document rather than clicking

            6    back and forth and being sloppy.  Everything relevant

            7    is there.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   For the vital signs are they

           10    automatically entered in the computer or do you have to

           11    type them in?

           12    A.      I have to type them in.

           13    Q.      And do you do the documentation then of the

           14    vital signs in the computer afterwards, in other words,

           15    after you write them down then later you go back and

           16    enter them?

           17    A.      No, usually I enter them right away.

           18    Q.      During the actual intake?

           19    A.      Yeah, yes.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   Is there ever a situation where you

           22    would not write down the vital signs but just remember

           23    them and then come back and do it?

           24    A.      No, no.

                                                                      72




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Does the computer -- does the

            3    instruments used to take the vital signs I take it you

            4    use some sort of a finger cuff for the pulse ox?

            5    A.      Uh-huh, yes.

            6    Q.      Does that also give you the heart rate?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   And then the standard machine for blood

           10    pressure I take it you use a digital machine?

           11    A.      No, we do it manual.

           12    Q.      You do it manual?

           13    A.      Uh-huh.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Does that record those vital signs

           16    anywhere?

           17    A.      No.

           18    Q.      So you got to actually get them, write them

           19    down and then put them on the computer; is that right?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      For the intake process how does -- how did

           22    Mr. Adami get -- walk me through it, where did it take

           23    place, how do you get him, how does that happen?

           24    A.      There is the reception area for the officers

                                                                      73




            1    where their holding cells are.  The officers see them

            2    first.  They go through their set of medical questions

            3    to determine if there's any urgent needs that we need

            4    to address or if they're safe or not for us to see.

            5    Then once we're ready to see the inmate they walk about

            6    20 feet up to our office where they are seen.

            7    Q.      They meaning the inmate?

            8    A.      The inmate, yes.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   And then you meet with them in the

           11    office?

           12    A.      Correct.

           13    Q.      And then when that's complete?

           14    A.      Once my medical portion is done they walk --

           15    if the case manager is there, it depends on the time of

           16    day, the case manager is like five feet from my office

           17    during that 20 feet walk they'll sit with the case

           18    manager, see them, get their phone call, talk about

           19    whatever is going on with them legally and then they'll

           20    go back to the holding cells.

           21    Q.      When you're in intake do you go down to the

           22    holding cell area at all?

           23    A.      Yeah, yes.

           24    Q.      What for?

                                                                      74




            1    A.      To see if there's anything urgent going on, if

            2    there's inmates complaining of things then we can go

            3    check them out there.  That's how we can go get the

            4    inmates.  Sometimes the officers will just bring them

            5    to us.  Other times if they're busy or I don't know we

            6    can just go down there and ask them for the next person

            7    to be seen and then we walk them back up to the medical

            8    office.

            9    Q.      On average how many intakes do you do on a

           10    shift?

           11    A.      It depends on the shift and the day.

           12    Q.      Give me a range, I have no idea?

           13    A.      Thursdays -- Wednesdays through Fridays are

           14    typically very busy.  Second shift you can do anywhere

           15    like 20 or 30 intakes.  First shift it's hit or miss

           16    you can get 3 intakes or you can get 12.

           17    Q.      So I want to ask you about some specific

           18    entries on P000021.  The entry forth up under patient

           19    appearance; do you see that?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   Did you type this entry or did you

           23    click on it?

           24    A.      The options for patient appearance are other,

                                                                      75




            1    disheveled.  There's nothing that says like

            2    appropriate.  So if there's anything slightly different

            3    you have to click other so...

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   You click on other and then what?

            6    A.      And then you type.

            7                   MR. INSCHO:  Yeah, I'm not going to go

            8    through and -- if there's documents that are different

            9    she's going to have to come back.  I'm not going to go

           10    through based on John what you give me frankly and

           11    documentation based on that.

           12                   MR. NINOSKY:  I'm trying to be helpful

           13    to show you the various options.  I'm trying to be

           14    helpful.  I won't be helpful and she's not coming back

           15    so go ahead.

           16                   MR. INSCHO:  Off the record --

           17                   THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record,

            1    BY MR. INSCHO:

            2    Q.      Ms. Grous, before we left off we were asking

            3    about your entry for patient's appearance.  And I asked

            4    you how you entered it and you told me that there's --

            5    you have to enter other for anything that isn't normal

            6    appearance; is that right?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Is that what you entered here, other?

            9    A.      Yes.

           10    Q.      So did you type in inappropriate?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   And then everything else here you would

           14    have typed in?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      What did you write, can you read it for me?

           17    A.      Inappropriate, patient tired, stumbling when

           18    ambulating but able to regain composure.  Appears very

           19    tired.  Per CO Prendergast patient presented this way

           20    when he was booked in.  Patient oriented x3.

           21    Q.      When did you speak with CO Prendergast?

           22    A.      Probably before -- I don't know.  It could

           23    have been before or after my interaction with the

           24    patient.

                                                                      77




            1    Q.      Is that standard procedure that you interview

            2    the CO about the patient when you do an intake?

            3                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form as to

            4    interview --

            5                   THE WITNESS:  I ask about their

            6    presentation to assure there's been no changes or if

            7    there's anything concerning going on that they

            8    witnessed.

            9    BY MR. INSCHO:

           10    Q.      Do you know what shift CO Prendergast worked?

           11    A.      Yeah, it would have been 6:00 to 2:00.

           12    Q.      Do you know if he was in the intake department

           13    the whole time?

           14    A.      Yes.

           15    Q.      Do you know what intake cell Mr. Adami was in?

           16    A.      No.

           17    Q.      There are a handful of cells; is that right?

           18    A.      6 cells for the males.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Would you have documented your

           21    conversation with CO Prendergast at all?

           22    A.      I did here, yeah.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   And you don't know whether that would

                                                                      78




            1    be before or after your intake?

            2    A.      It could have been after.  When I'm doing the

            3    questions with the inmate I'll leave this document open

            4    on my computer screen just so that I can go through the

            5    questions, give any treatment or anything that's

            6    needed, and then just go back to make sure I don't have

            7    any typos or anything like that or that I didn't miss

            8    anything.  So it could have been before.

            9    Q.      You asked -- if we go on to the next page,

           10    middle of the way down there's a question do you use

           11    heroin or Methadone.  Is that part of the standard

           12    intake question?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      In other words, you ask everyone whether or

           15    not they use heroin or Methadone even before you ask

           16    them whether or not they use drugs?

           17    A.      We -- I don't say do you use drugs then do you

           18    go through this.  Because some people they might be

           19    prescribed Methadone so --

           20    Q.      Right.

           21    A.      -- or they might be prescribed Benzo's so it's

           22    not do you use drugs, somethings are prescribed.  I go

           23    through every question and say do you use heroin or

           24    Methadone.

                                                                      79




            1    Q.      And this information you have your addict 7

            2    days a week.  Would that have been typed in?

            3    A.      No, that's one of the options to pick.  You

            4    can do addict which is 7 days a week.  I don't remember

            5    what the next, you know, addict what the next one is.

            6    But it's 3 or more times a week, once a week or like

            7    once a month or something.

            8    Q.      Addict would be the most --

            9    A.      Yes.

           10    Q.      -- significant level of use?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Heroin two bundles daily and then it has

           13    (snorting).  Would you type that in or is that

           14    something you click?

           15    A.      I type that.

           16    Q.      Is that information he would have given you?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      What is two bundles of heroin, what is that?

           19                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           20                   MR. INSCHO:  If you know.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  It depends on the area.

           22    If you're in Bucks County that might be 14 bags of

           23    heroin.  If you're in Kensington that might be 12 bags

           24    of heroin.  It really depends.  The amount of baggies

                                                                      80




            1    in a bundle depends on the area.

            2    BY MR. INSCHO:

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   And then it has current detox symptoms

            5    and there's chills and vomiting.  Did you type those or

            6    did you click on those?

            7    A.      I type those.

            8    Q.      Are there click options for detox symptoms?

            9    A.      No.

           10    Q.      You have to type them in?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Take me through how you ask about detox

           14    symptoms?

           15    A.      It's -- also it's my observation if I see

           16    anything that's unusual or detox related and I also ask

           17    what they're experiencing as well.

           18    Q.      Do you go through a list of are you

           19    experiencing chills, are you experiencing goose bumps

           20    or do you ask what's going on?

           21    A.      I ask general, you know, do you have any detox

           22    symptoms, how do you feel, do you feel anything

           23    abnormal.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                      81




            1                   So you have then in parenthesis after

            2    vomiting (not witnessed by any CO's while in

            3    reception); do you see that?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Is that -- where did you get that

            7    information?

            8    A.      I ask the officers if they see anything

            9    unusual if they see him vomiting.

           10    Q.      How many officers?

           11    A.      There would have been two at the time.

           12    Q.      Is that part of your standard practice if

           13    someone says they're vomiting you go out and check to

           14    see if they -- the officers saw vomiting?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   What other symptoms do you seek to

           18    confirm or refute by interviewing the officers?

           19    A.      Just the vomiting, that's it.

           20    Q.      Why?

           21    A.      Because it could be anxiety that they're

           22    throwing up.  A lot of times people say they're

           23    throwing up and really it's just acid reflux or they're

           24    just spitting.  You can throw up once because you're

                                                                      82




            1    anxious.  You could throw up because you have a stomach

            2    bug.  You could be throwing up repeatedly.  So it kind

            3    of paints the picture for what's going on.

            4    Q.      Did you ask any of those questions of

            5    Mr. Adami when he told you he was vomiting?

            6    A.      What do you mean?

            7    Q.      Well, you just described that vomiting can

            8    mean a lot of different things.

            9    A.      Uh-huh.

           10    Q.      It can be someone is continuously vomiting,

           11    spitting up, feeling anxious.  Did you ask any of those

           12    questions of Mr. Adami about his vomiting?

           13    A.      No.

           14    Q.      You then have last use and you entered

           15    yesterday.  Is that something you click on or type?

           16    A.      That is what you click on.

           17    Q.      And then the quantity you use you have in "a

           18    few bags"?

           19    A.      Yes, that was typed.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   How long does the whole intake process

           22    take?

           23    A.      It depends on the person.

           24    Q.      The meeting in the office?

                                                                      83




            1    A.      It depends on the person.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3    A.      It could take 20 minutes to an hour and a

            4    half.  It really depends.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   How long -- for someone like Mr. Adami

            7    who you described as cooperative and able to

            8    communicate, right, how long would that typical intake

            9    be?

           10    A.      20 minutes perhaps.

           11    Q.      I mean, could it be done in like 5 to 7

           12    minutes?

           13    A.      If he doesn't have much of a medical history

           14    and he's cooperative it could be.

           15    Q.      On Page 000025 the fourth item down it says

           16    once a release of information complete and routed to

           17    facility administrative staff this must be completed

           18    and routed prior to patient leaving intake interview;

           19    do you see that?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      And you put refused.  Can you explain to me

           22    what that was and what happened?

           23    A.      That's in regard to the question right above

           24    it if there was a sexual assault that occurred.  If you

                                                                      84




            1    click the button no for the release of information for

            2    whatever reason our computer generates a task saying

            3    that there was a sexual assault but there was not.  So

            4    you have to click refuse to avoid all of this sexual

            5    assault triggers and tasks and things like that.

            6    Q.      All right.

            7                   So this is actually going back -- this

            8    is going back a ways into the questionnaire.  There are

            9    questions about -- generally about sexual assault?

           10    A.      Yes, because of PREA in the prisons.

           11    Q.      I see.  And just take a look, Mr. Adami had

           12    not been a victim of sexual assault and didn't report

           13    any sexual assault to you?

           14    A.      Correct, we asked about sexual assault.  He

           15    said he had not been sexually assaulted.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   And then you get down to a question

           18    about release of information of sexual assault and the

           19    computer makes you say refused otherwise it's going to

           20    report that he was sexually assaulted?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Is that still the way it works?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      I forgot to ask you this but when you entered

                                                                      85




            1    yes that Mr. Adami was an opiate addict did that

            2    automatically throw him into the opiate detox protocol?

            3    A.      Yes.

            4    Q.      And the computer would have done that?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      If we go to Page 000026 about a little more

            7    than halfway down the page there's a question for

            8    disposition and it says detox.  Is that something that

            9    you entered or is that something the computer

           10    automatically does?

           11    A.      That's what I entered.

           12    Q.      And what does that mean, disposition detox?

           13    A.      Disposition is like the plan of care.  Detox

           14    is the detox protocol.

           15    Q.      And then it has referrals to nurse

           16    practitioner, PA; is that right?

           17    A.      Yes, that's one of the options you select.

           18    Q.      Is that automatically done when you put

           19    someone in detox?

           20    A.      You have to select NP/PA or mental health or I

           21    think maybe dentist is one of them.  So I select PA

           22    because that is part of the detox protocol.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   You have to actually do it but it's

                                                                      86




            1    dictated by the protocol?

            2    A.      Correct.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Then and there's questions of was

            5    patient given a full explanation of medical services

            6    available at the facility you say yes.  Is that part of

            7    an explanation, a verbal explanation you give everyone?

            8    A.      Yes, I give a verbal explanation.  It's also

            9    in their consent packets that they sign.  It's also

           10    posted in reception, in my intake room, on each block

           11    and at the entrance of medical.  So not only do I

           12    provide that explanation verbally and in their intake

           13    consents but it's posted everywhere about how to access

           14    medical services.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   How long is the explanation?

           17    A.      It's brief.  You explain that there is a sick

           18    call process and how to use it.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   I take it you've done lots of these

           21    intakes.  Could you give me your speech?

           22    A.      Sure, I mean, it's been a while since I've

           23    been in this position -- I mean, since I've been the

           24    Assistant Director of Nursing.

                                                                      87




            1    Q.      I understand.

            2    A.      I would say -- I would hand the packet of

            3    papers with the consents and it has that sick call

            4    information on it.  I would say if you have any medical

            5    concerns, mental health concerns, any changes in your

            6    medical status, any medical complaints at all or mental

            7    health complaints, could be dental, detox, again,

            8    mental health, there are various ways of getting in

            9    touch with medical which would be you can utilize the

           10    officers, you can utilize the phone system for sick

           11    call, you can write out a paper sick call and then the

           12    kiosks on the block do it as well, I believe, with the

           13    phone system they communicate.  And I explain those to

           14    them and that's it.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   That's what you would tell them to

           17    explain the medical services at the facility?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Let me ask you a couple questions about those

           20    services now and not about what you tell the inmates

           21    during intake.

           22    A.      Okay.

           23    Q.      You said the phone system allows you to call

           24    medical; is that right?

                                                                      88




            1    A.      You use the phone system and you can pick

            2    different options for whatever complaint you have and

            3    then it goes to the computer system that the officers

            4    use which we have access to for the sick calls.  It's

            5    the officers computer system but we can use it for the

            6    sick calls, if that makes sense, to see who put in the

            7    telephone sick calls and what their complaint is and

            8    then we see them for that.  So that's the phone system.

            9    Q.      And is that in the phone room on the blocks?

           10    A.      Yes, the phone room is accessible to anyone

           11    that's not locked.

           12    Q.      Where are the sick call slips?

           13    A.      The slips at that time the officers had them

           14    and the inmates could either give them to the officers,

           15    give them to any of the medical personnel that was on

           16    the blocks for med cart, detox checks, segregation

           17    rounds or they can put it in a sick call box which is

           18    by the chow hall and we check that box several times a

           19    day.  Yeah, so that's the paper ones.

           20    Q.      Where do you get the slips from?  You said the

           21    officers have them.

           22    A.      Yeah, so the inmate can ask the officer for a

           23    green slip.  The officer doesn't know if it's for us,

           24    for mental health.  It could be for probation and

                                                                      89




            1    parole, public defender.  It doesn't have to be

            2    specifically for medical.  They are not asked -- the

            3    inmates aren't asked by the officers to clarify it

            4    because it's not their business.

            5    Q.      And you said kiosks, so what are those?

            6    A.      It's where they order commissary on the block.

            7    I believe that they can have the same thing.  I think

            8    it connects to the phones perhaps and they just use

            9    those.

           10    Q.      After those call slips are -- or sick call

           11    slips is that what you call them?

           12    A.      Yeah.

           13    Q.      After those are obtained where do they go?

           14    A.      They go directly to the nurses and anyone

           15    that's having any urgent issues we see them right away.

           16    Q.      Who brings them down?

           17    A.      The nurses get them if -- like I said, we're

           18    on the blocks several times a day for meds, detox

           19    checks, segregation rounds or if we just have to go to

           20    the block for a random reason the inmates can give them

           21    to us or the officers can give them to us or they're in

           22    that box by the chow hall which we check repeatedly

           23    throughout the day.  They have moved now to put in a

           24    box on every single block so that has changed.

                                                                      90




            1    Q.      When did they do that?

            2    A.      A few months ago.

            3    Q.      Why did they do that?

            4    A.      Just -- I don't know, just to give the inmates

            5    more options.

            6    Q.      It was so easy to get call slips to medical

            7    and then a few months they added a bunch of new places

            8    that they could get call slips to medical; is that

            9    right?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      Let's go to P000027 third item down it says

           12    yes, RWM for detox --

           13    A.      Uh-huh.

           14    Q.      -- did you click on that or type that?

           15    A.      I typed -- let's see, clicked yes and typed

           16    RWM for detox.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   It says if required what alerts were

           19    placed in CorEMR and OMS --

           20    A.      Uh-huh.

           21    Q.      What are those abbreviations?

           22    A.      CorEMR is the nurse's charting system so the

           23    officers don't have access to that but the nurses and

           24    medical team can see the alerts.  And RMS is the

                                                                      91




            1    officer management system.  So that's our way of

            2    communicating with the officers that people have these

            3    alerts and are on watches.

            4    Q.      It looks like you entered that watch at 10:35,

            5    that would have been before you spoke to any provider;

            6    is that right?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Now, you don't need to speak to a provider to

            9    put a detox patient on watch, correct?

           10    A.      Correct.

           11    Q.      And RWM stands for?

           12    A.      Regular watch medical.

           13    Q.      What other watches are available?

           14    A.      At that time?

           15    Q.      Strike that.

           16                   What other watches are available for

           17    the medical providers not what security might do, what

           18    could you order?

           19    A.      Acute watch medical.

           20    Q.      And what's the difference between regular

           21    watch medical and acute watch medical?

           22    A.      Regular watch medical they're getting checked

           23    every 30 minutes by the officers or the inmate

           24    monitors.  Acute watch medical is someone who is very

                                                                      92




            1    acutely medically concerning so they would get locked

            2    in their cell 24/7 with the lights on and have an

            3    inmate babysitter 24/7 watching them.

            4    Q.      Is that utilized for anything other than

            5    suicide watch?

            6    A.      No, that's for the medical watch, that's acute

            7    watch medical.  So there are suicide watches.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9    A.      But yeah, regular watch medical is for detox.

           10    Acute watch medical is for any acute medical concern.

           11    Q.      On P00028 this is now the suicide screening.

           12    Is that a separate screen that you enter, you go

           13    through kind of regular intake and then you go to the

           14    suicide screening, that's a separate tool?

           15    A.      Yes, uh-huh.

           16    Q.      What other tools I see there's vital signs,

           17    suicide screening, medical screening, what other

           18    screenings are there?

           19    A.      The only other one -- there's two others, the

           20    influenza screening or the vitals and then the mental

           21    health screening for men or women, but...

           22    Q.      And it says here patient is appears to be

           23    under the influence of alcohol and drugs; do you see

           24    that?

                                                                      93




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      I take it you didn't write the question?

            3    A.      Correct.

            4    Q.      But is that the way the question appears?

            5    A.      Yeah.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   And you say yes but this -- the one

            8    point just means that just increases someone's risk of

            9    suicide; is that right?

           10    A.      Correct, yeah, I didn't write the one point,

           11    that's already in there.

           12    Q.      And it says if yes, is patient incoherent or

           13    showing signs of withdrawal or mental illness.  And it

           14    says here you wrote no.  And then you wrote down -- did

           15    you type that answer then after no?

           16    A.      I selected no and then I did type that answer.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   Will you agree with me that chills is a

           19    sign of withdrawal?

           20    A.      Yeah, but the question says are they showing

           21    signs of withdrawal.  That's not showing me signs,

           22    that's just his verbal complaints.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   So what does someone have to do to show

                                                                      94




            1    you signs of withdrawal?

            2    A.      Vomit in front of me in terms of showing, you

            3    know, it could be vomiting in front of me.  They could

            4    have goose bumps, restlessness and that kind of stuff.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   So when you say showing -- when you

            7    answered the question showing signs of withdrawal, you

            8    mean that you have to physically witness something; is

            9    that right?

           10    A.      Yes, uh-huh.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   So someone can be experiencing chills,

           13    anxiety, horribly nauseous and you would say they're

           14    not showing signs of withdrawal; is that right, because

           15    you didn't see any of those?

           16                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           17                   THE WITNESS:  Yes, but that's what the

           18    question is asking.

           19    BY MR. INSCHO:

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   And you write here reporting chills and

           22    vomiting, however, he has been in reception for several

           23    hours and the CO's have not witnessed any vomiting.

           24    When did you type that in?

                                                                      95




            1    A.      I guess at 10:35 when it was written or

            2    submitted.

            3    Q.      What difference, if any, is there in how

            4    someone is handled in detox if they're vomiting or not

            5    vomiting?

            6    A.      The only difference is if they're vomiting

            7    right in front of me or vomiting profusely while

            8    they're in reception I would go get them an injection

            9    of Zofran to help with their nausea and vomiting,

           10    that's it.

           11    Q.      You can give them an injection of Zofran at

           12    intake?

           13    A.      I would call the provider and get that order

           14    and then I would go get it or someone would bring it to

           15    me.

           16    Q.      Are injections of Zofran given as part of med

           17    cart?

           18    A.      If they need an injection -- well, for that

           19    medication taper with Zofran in it it's ordered as oral

           20    or IM which is the injection.  So if an inmate comes to

           21    the med cart and says I'm throwing up can I have a

           22    shot, absolutely, they'll send him to the dispensary

           23    and we can give it to him.

           24    Q.      So the answer is no the injection is not given

                                                                      96




            1    as part of med cart?

            2    A.      No, it's not on the cart, sorry, but it is

            3    offered.

            4    Q.      Is that intake the only time you saw Frederick

            5    Adami until the emergency the next morning?

            6    A.      I think so, yes.

            7    Q.      I did want to ask you about vital signs real

            8    quickly.  I'll show you what I just marked as P-2.

            9                       - - -

           10                   (Whereupon, P-2 was marked for

           11    identification.)

           12                       - - -

           13    BY MR. INSCHO:

           14    Q.      If we go to the second page of P-2 which is

           15    Bates numbered P00010.  It has here a date of reading

           16    at 10:37 a.m.; do you see that?

           17    A.      Uh-huh, yes.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   That would have been the time you

           20    entered the vital signs into the computer; is that

           21    right?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      All right.

           24                   And it doesn't have your name here but

                                                                      97




            1    I assume these were your vital signs; is that right?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   And you do -- for intake you only do

            5    blood pressure sitting; is that right?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      Why don't you do blood pressure sitting and

            8    standing?

            9                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           10                   THE WITNESS:  Because that's not our

           11    protocol.

           12    BY MR. INSCHO:

           13    Q.      For part of the standard detox check you do

           14    both sitting and standing, correct?

           15    A.      Yes, if you're doing the detox checks.

           16    Q.      But you weren't doing a detox check when you

           17    were doing intake, correct?

           18    A.      Right.

           19    Q.      It has here pulse sitting and standing.  Is

           20    that something that is done as part of the detox check?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   And since you're doing intake and not

           24    doing a detox check you only did sitting; is that

                                                                      98




            1    right?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   What do you use as far as measuring

            5    normal or abnormal pulses and blood pressures?

            6    A.      We have our protocols for -- like we have our

            7    own parameters for blood pressure, heart rate,

            8    temperature.

            9    Q.      For heart rate do you use any age based heart

           10    rates or is it the same whether a guy is 52 or 25?

           11    A.      It's the same.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   So the range of normal is the same for

           14    Mr. Cavaliere as well as myself?

           15    A.      Yes.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   What's the normal range for heart rate

           18    that you use for all ages?

           19                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form as

           20    normal, but you can answer his question.

           21    BY MR. INSCHO:

           22    Q.      Or I'm sorry, what term would you use for

           23    heart rate?

           24    A.      You mean for our parameters?

                                                                      99




            1    Q.      Parameters, what do you call them if it's

            2    within the parameter what do you call it?

            3    A.      Within normal limits.

            4    Q.      Within normal limits, okay.

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      What are the normal limits for heart rate for

            7    all ages?

            8    A.      Below 60 and above 110.

            9    Q.      What are -- for blood pressure same thing not

           10    age based?

           11    A.      Correct.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   What blood pressure range do you use

           14    for within normal limits for all ages?

           15    A.      Below I believe is under 90/60 and then for

           16    elevated it would be greater than 150/100.

           17    Q.      Give it to me again, 90 --

           18    A.      90/60.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20    A.      And then 150 -- it's greater than 150/100.

           21    Q.      Do you have a parameter for the difference

           22    between sitting and standing for orthostatic

           23    hypotension?

           24    A.      Yes.

                                                                     100




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Do you know what that is?

            3    A.      I believe it's a 10 point difference.

            4    Q.      Diastolic or systolic?

            5    A.      I think it's systolic.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   How do you do respiration rate?

            8    A.      You count their breathing when they're not

            9    aware that you're counting it.

           10    Q.      You don't use a stethoscope?

           11    A.      No.

           12    Q.      Do you use a stethoscope in your examination

           13    at all?

           14    A.      If there's an indication to use it.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Otherwise you just use it for the blood

           17    pressure I take it?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      What's the normal range for respiration rate?

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form but

           21    you can answer.

           22                   THE WITNESS:  I believe for Prime Care

           23    I think it's 16 to 22.  I'm not a hundred percent sure.

            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                       - - -

            3                   (Whereupon, P-3 was marked for

            4    identification.)

            5                       - - -

            6    BY MR. INSCHO:

            7    Q.      I'm showing you what's marked as P-3.  This is

            8    a series of appointment tasks that are printed out.

            9    Tell me if I'm correct that that's what I'm looking at

           10    here?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Is this automatically generated when you put

           13    it into the computer?

           14    A.      The tasks are generated, yes.

           15    Q.      And that's automatically generated when you

           16    enter someone into the detox protocol they're going to

           17    get all the detox checks we see here on the first page?

           18    A.      Correct.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   The second one here is detox check and

           21    it indicates priority high.  Priority 1 that's the

           22    highest priority; is that right?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     102




            1                   And then it goes down it says

            2    appointment change note intake completed first shift,

            3    what does that mean?

            4    A.      It automatically generates for first shift and

            5    second shift.  So say you do someone's intake at 8:00

            6    at night it will still generate the first shift task

            7    for that day even though the first shift is already

            8    done.  So I did his intake first shift so the next

            9    detox check would be done second shift.  So you delete

           10    that first shift task because it's still currently

           11    first shift.

           12    Q.      Why is that a priority 1?

           13    A.      I don't know, that's --

           14    Q.      Do you set the priorities?

           15    A.      No.

           16    Q.      So -- and to be clear, you did not do a detox

           17    check, this is just automatically entered in the

           18    computer?

           19    A.      Yes, the task itself is automatically

           20    generated.

           21    Q.      Did you indicate that the task -- the intake

           22    completed first shift did you enter that?

           23    A.      Yes.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     103




            1                   First shift 6:00 a.m. to 2:30 so this

            2    would have been right in about the middle that you

            3    would have seen Mr. Adami; is that right?

            4    A.      Correct.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Is there a typical time of day when the

            7    detox checks are done?

            8    A.      Typically in the morning.

            9    Q.      First thing?

           10    A.      It depends on the person, yeah, it could be

           11    first thing, it could be the middle of the morning, it

           12    depends.

           13    Q.      You told me there are a couple units that are

           14    closer to medical than others.  I think it was E and G

           15    if my memory serves me right?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      Those detox -- those units are they used for

           18    any particular type of inmate?

           19    A.      Typically those ones are for sex offenders.

           20    Q.      Can you -- can medical request that an inmate

           21    be housed in either of those?

           22    A.      We can, yes.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   All the other information we see here

                                                                     104




            1    let me see if I can cut through it.  Everything that's

            2    on this document that is these tasks that are generated

            3    with the exception of your clicking intake completed

            4    first shift, were all of these tasks just populated by

            5    the computer, you didn't have any actual involvement in

            6    entering this information?

            7    A.      The detox related ones were generated

            8    automatically.  The ones that I created is for the HSA

            9    just to review the chart because he was a medical

           10    emergency.

           11    Q.      Okay.

           12                   And that you did the following day; is

           13    that right?

           14    A.      Yes, after the event happened and he was sent

           15    to the hospital?

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17    A.      And then the hospital update task I generated

           18    and that's it.

           19    Q.      Why were you the person to generate those

           20    tasks the following day?

           21    A.      Because I was there for the event that

           22    happened.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24    A.      So that's what we're supposed to do.

                                                                     105




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Have any other inmates died at Bucks

            3    County Correctional Facility while you were there,

            4    meaning, let's start with while you were physically

            5    there?

            6    A.      While I was physically there, yes.

            7    Q.      How many?

            8    A.      2.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   What were the causes of death there?

           11    A.      Suicide.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   When were they?

           14    A.      Well, one he was already pronounced I came but

           15    he was still -- I mean, I came to work and he was still

           16    on the block but he was already pronounced.  That was

           17    maybe 2, 3 months ago at the most.  And the other one

           18    was after this event.  So I would say the last --

           19    within the last year.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   I know there have been other people

           22    that have died while you weren't physically there.  Did

           23    you have any involvement in any other inmate deaths?

           24    A.      No.

                                                                     106




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                       - - -

            5                       - - -

            6    BY MR. INSCHO:

            7    Q.      I'll show you what's been marked as P-4.  I

            8    want to look at starting with the third entry down here

            9    the records are referencing some entries you made at

           10    1:45 p.m.; do you see that?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   Tell me what happened at 1:45 p.m.?

           14    A.      I called the provider to get orders for his

           15    intake.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   Why wait from 10:35 until 1:45 p.m. to

           18    call the provider?

           19    A.      We only have to get orders near the end of our

           20    shift unless there's something emergent.  So we get --

           21    we do a bunch of intakes and then we get orders unless

           22    there's an emergency situation or urgent situation.

           23    Q.      I guess my question is why did you wait until

           24    1:45?

                                                                     107




            1                   MR. NINOSKY:  Asked and answered, you

            2    can tell him again.

            3                   THE WITNESS:  We get orders at the end

            4    of our shift unless there's an emergency situation.

            5    BY MR. INSCHO:

            6    Q.      Is there some reason why you couldn't get the

            7    orders at the time they're indicated when you see the

            8    patient?

            9                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           10                   THE WITNESS:  That's just our protocol

           11    unless there's something emergently happening we're

           12    supposed do it at the end of our shift.

           13    BY MR. INSCHO:

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   So if someone comes in and you see them

           16    for intake at 7:00 a.m. right when you get there --

           17    A.      Uh-huh.

           18    Q.      -- unless there's an emergency you don't call

           19    for any orders until 2:30?

           20    A.      Until before that, yeah, because it takes time

           21    to put them in the computer and everything.

           22    Q.      I mean, typically you would call around a

           23    little before 2:00 is that your practice?

           24    A.      Yeah, around 1:30, 1:45.

                                                                     108




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2                   Where is -- is it a written protocol

            3    that orders should be waited until the end of the shift

            4    to be entered?

            5                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            6                   THE WITNESS:  No.

            7    BY MR. INSCHO:

            8    Q.      So who taught you that you should wait until

            9    the end of the shift for intake orders to be entered?

           10                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           11                   THE WITNESS:  I don't know that it was

           12    necessarily taught as standard practice, that's just

           13    what happens and --

           14    BY MR. INSCHO:

           15    Q.      I think you described it as the protocol; is

           16    that right, did I use that word correctly?

           17    A.      I might have misspoken.  It's not like a

           18    written protocol but it's just what we typically do.

           19    Q.      Is it something you were taught to do or is it

           20    just something that you did as your practice?

           21    A.      It's what the nurses generally do.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Who is it that -- it has here telephone

           24    verbal order, that's the category, second column; do

                                                                     109




            1    you see that?

            2    A.      Uh-huh, yes.

            3    Q.      And provider called was M. Champlin, NP, nurse

            4    practitioner; is that right?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      How do you say her name?

            7    A.      Martha Champlin, NP.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Was this actually a telephone call?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      Why would you call the provider -- why would

           12    you call the provider at 1:45 in the afternoon, would

           13    there have been someone there you could have actually

           14    spoken to in person or what's the process there?

           15    A.      If I was getting calls or if I was getting

           16    orders from a provider on-call it would have been a

           17    weekend.  So his intake would have been done on a

           18    weekend when there's no providers there so we have to

           19    physically or we have to call the provider and get our

           20    orders.

           21    Q.      So if this is a weekday it shouldn't be a

           22    telephone verbal order?

           23    A.      It still has to be a telephone verbal order

           24    either way.  That's the way of documenting that someone

                                                                     110




            1    gave you an order.  That's just the technical term no

            2    matter -- like that's for nursing in general no matter

            3    what facility you're at.

            4    Q.      So your understanding is that telephone verbal

            5    order doesn't necessarily involve the telephone?

            6    A.      Yes, I understand that's nursing.  I mean,

            7    that's everywhere.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9    A.      It's not just Prime Care or the jail.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   So was this a telephone call with

           12    Martha Champlin or could this have been an in-person

           13    conversation?

           14    A.      It was a phone call because she does not come

           15    to our facility.  She's only on-call.

           16    Q.      Okay.

           17                   And that indicates it must have been a

           18    weekend to you because if it were during the week you

           19    would have actually spoken to the provider?

           20    A.      I would have spoken to not Martha because

           21    Martha is only on-cal for us.  She has never set foot

           22    in our building.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   But you would have spoken to an actual

                                                                     111




            1    provider whomever it was who was working that day if it

            2    were during the week?

            3    A.      Yes.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   The intake orders is that something you

            6    would have typed?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   And it says RWM detox protocol opiate

           10    taper.  Is that the order set that would have been

           11    ordered?

           12    A.      Yes, well, it's -- yes, it's regular watch

           13    medical, the detox protocol and the opiate taper meds.

           14    Q.      And it says follow-up as scheduled, what does

           15    that mean?

           16    A.      They have -- it's in our protocol they have

           17    their detox check the next following detox check and

           18    they see the PA when they're scheduled to.

           19    Q.      And as scheduled means as scheduled by the

           20    computer?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Would you have essentially run through all of

           23    your intakes in the same phone call with Martha

           24    Champlin?

                                                                     112




            1    A.      Yes.

            2    Q.      How do you call her if she's on-call?

            3    A.      I use a phone.

            4    Q.      That's a good idea.

            5    A.      Yeah.

            6    Q.      What kind of phone?

            7    A.      A telephone.

            8    Q.      Yeah, what number?

            9    A.      I don't know, it's her cell phone, yeah.

           10    Q.      Okay, all right.

           11                   Is she working somewhere for Prime

           12    Care?

           13    A.      No, she -- if this was a weekend she could be

           14    at home doing whatever she does.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   Where do you call from?

           17    A.      The intake room.

           18    Q.      You use a landline phone?

           19    A.      Yes.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   And does Ms. Champlin still work for

           22    the company?

           23    A.      No.

           24    Q.      Do you remember her cell phone?

                                                                     113




            1    A.      No.

            2    Q.      Okay.

            3                   Do you know if it was a personal cell

            4    phone or a company cell phone?

            5    A.      Personal, none of the providers have company

            6    cell phones.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                       - - -

            9                   (Whereupon, P-5 was marked for

           10    identification.)

           11                       - - -

           12    BY MR. INSCHO:

           13    Q.      I'm going to show you what's marked as P-5.  I

           14    want you to find the orders that would have been

           15    entered as a result of this phone call.  I believe they

           16    were -- I believe they are 000081 through 000084.

           17    A.      Oh, yeah, I forgot Bentyl is one of them.  We

           18    don't really use this taper too much so yeah, it's

           19    Bentyl that's on there as well.

           20    Q.      When you say you don't use this taper too

           21    much, what do you mean?

           22    A.      Since they added the Clonidine one that's just

           23    used more often.  So I forgot Bentyl was on there.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     114




            1                   In the verbal order that you entered it

            2    just said opiate taper?

            3    A.      Yes, because that was the only one that was an

            4    option at the time.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   And since now is there -- there's a

            7    Vistaril and a Clonidine one?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   Tell me about Bentyl, is Bentyl only on

           11    the Vistaril?

           12    A.      Yes.

           13    Q.      Am I correct with which orders you would have

           14    entered?

           15    A.      Yeah, the opiate taper.

           16    Q.      Pages 000081 through 000084; is that right?

           17    A.      Yes.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   The prescribers name it's entered under

           20    Victoria Gessner, she's the Medical Director; is that

           21    right?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      And she never saw Mr. Adami, correct?

           24    A.      Right, she's just our prescribing doctor for

                                                                     115




            1    everything.  So when you pick any of the tapers whether

            2    it's Benzo, alcohol, whatever, her name is

            3    automatically the one that generates.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   So Nurse Champlin's name actually

            6    doesn't appear anywhere on here but she's the one that

            7    actually signed off on the order; is that right?

            8    A.      Yes, because the only option we're given is

            9    for Doctor Gessner.  Or actually we don't even really

           10    get the option, it just comes up when you click the

           11    opiate taper.

           12    Q.      Is every medication ordered at Bucks County

           13    Correctional Facility effectively ordered under Doctor

           14    Gessner's name?

           15    A.      I don't know how it works with the prescribing

           16    stuff because she's the Medical Director and she has

           17    prescribing authority or something.  So if the PA's

           18    order something they're the ones ordering it but it

           19    ultimately falls on her so...

           20    Q.      I guess my question is for every medication

           21    order at the Bucks County Correctional Facility is the

           22    prescriber name going to come up as Doctor Gessner?

           23    A.      No, for mental health medications they have

           24    the option of selecting a mental health provider.  For

                                                                     116




            1    the tapers, yes, it's Doctor Gessner.

            2    Q.      Is it for any medical non-psychiatric drugs

            3    are all going to come up prescribed by Doctor Gessner?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      The first drug we have here is Bentyl, dosing

            6    is TID; what does that mean?

            7    A.      Three times a day.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   And it lists 30 days that's because

           10    this is automatically set for 10 days?

           11                   MR. NINOSKY:  You mean 30 doses?

           12                   MR. INSCHO:  30 doses, yeah.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  Yes, it's automatically

           14    generated.  I just click opiate taper and it makes all

           15    of this.

           16    BY MR. INSCHO:

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   You describe it as a taper, are any of

           19    the medications actually tapered down?

           20    A.      I think the Vistaril used to be -- yes, they

           21    are and it's not shown on here.

           22    Q.      Okay.

           23                   Which ones are tapered?

           24    A.      The Vistaril.  It's not printed out on here

                                                                     117




            1    but that's probably because it ended when he passed.

            2    Q.      Uh-huh.

            3    A.      Because the Vistaril is supposed to be given

            4    three times a day for one day and then it goes down to

            5    two times a day then once a day then it's done.  And I

            6    think the Zofran was the same thing, too.  I think it

            7    was three times a day, then twice a day and then it's

            8    down and the Pepto as well.

            9    Q.      Is it your understanding that opiate

           10    withdrawal symptoms peak early and then get lessened as

           11    time passes?

           12                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           13                   THE WITNESS:  Again, it depends on the

           14    person.  Some people it depends on the opiate.

           15    Methadone is different.  Everyone has their own

           16    different way of --

           17    BY MR. INSCHO:

           18    Q.      Do you know why they're tapered?

           19    A.      That's the orders that I'm given.

           20    Q.      I understand that's the orders that you're

           21    given.  My question is do you know why they're tapered?

           22                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           23                   THE WITNESS:  You don't stay on it

           24    forever.  I'm not sure -- do I know what do you mean?

                                                                     118




            1    BY MR. INSCHO:

            2    Q.      In other words, why do they give those

            3    medications less over a period of days?

            4    A.      I don't know.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Why is Clonidine given as opposed to

            7    Vistaril, do you know that?

            8    A.      I don't know.

            9    Q.      Why is Tylenol III given to some detox

           10    patients and not others, do you know that?

           11    A.      I don't know.

           12    Q.      All those decisions need to be made by the

           13    provider; is that right?

           14    A.      Yes.

           15    Q.      Bismuth that's Pepto Bismol; is that right?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      How many times is that supposed to be given?

           18    A.      That was twice a day as needed.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Next page, the medication we see there

           21    what is that medication?

           22    A.      Zofran.

           23    Q.      What's Zofran for by the way?

           24    A.      Nausea and vomiting.

                                                                     119




            1    Q.      And how many times is that supposed to be

            2    given?

            3    A.      Three times a day as needed.

            4    Q.      And then doctors instructions one -- it says

            5    one PO or IM would that be intramuscular?

            6    A.      Yes, so either orally or intramuscular three

            7    times a day as needed.

            8    Q.      Next page, the Vistaril?

            9    A.      That's three times a day.

           10    Q.      And it's just recorded as TID?

           11    A.      Yes, that's three times a day.

           12    Q.      And that is an oral medication?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   Is it fair to say unless someone --

           16    unless a provider intervenes and decides that an

           17    intramuscular injection should be given all these

           18    medications are given at the med cart orally?

           19                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           20                   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, there isn't an

           21    injection form of Vistaril.  There isn't an injection

           22    form of Pepto.  There isn't an injection form of

           23    Bentyl.  So the only option is the injection of the

           24    Zofran and the inmate can request it or the nurse can

                                                                     120




            1    assess them and determine if it's indicated.  That's

            2    why we're given the option.

            3    BY MR. INSCHO:

            4    Q.      When do you tell the inmates that they can

            5    request the Zofran intramuscular?

            6    A.      The med cart nurse can tell them or you --

            7    again, you're assessing them for detox or you see them

            8    throwing up or they tell you they're throwing up or you

            9    know, again, it's an assessment, you can offer it to

           10    them.

           11    Q.      Do the med cart nurses have the intake?

           12    A.      Do you mean the forms they are available to

           13    them.

           14    Q.      Do the -- is there some notation given to the

           15    med cart nurses as to who has complained of vomiting?

           16    A.      No.

           17    Q.      What -- is there any written protocol for

           18    assuring that individuals receive their prescribed

           19    medications?

           20                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           21                   THE WITNESS:  Can you clarify, I'm

           22    sorry?

           23    BY MR. INSCHO:

           24    Q.      Yeah, is there some protocol about making sure

                                                                     121




            1    that inmates receive the medications that are ordered?

            2                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            3                   THE WITNESS:  Not that I know of.

            4    BY MR. INSCHO:

            5    Q.      How -- strike that.

            6                   The last involvement you would have had

            7    with Frederick Adami before the emergency would have

            8    been calling to obtain the orders for his medications;

            9    is that right?

           10    A.      Yes.

           11    Q.      You did not see him on the block at all until

           12    after the emergency and he's found nonresponsive; is

           13    that right?

           14    A.      Correct.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   You had no role in the detox checks; is

           17    that right?

           18    A.      Correct.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   And you would have had no reason to go

           21    and check on what was entered in those detox checks; is

           22    that right?

           23    A.      Correct.

           24    Q.      And you would have had no role in giving him

                                                                     122




            1    any medications while he's on the block; is that right?

            2    A.      Correct.

            3    Q.      You didn't give him any medications in intake;

            4    is that right?

            5    A.      Correct.

            6    Q.      Even though he's going to get some of those

            7    medications they ordered three times a day --

            8    A.      Uh-huh.

            9    Q.      -- you didn't give him them in intake?

           10    A.      Correct, he could have been back on the block

           11    by the time I got orders.

           12    Q.      You could call for orders at the time of

           13    intake; is that right?

           14    A.      Yes.

           15    Q.      But that's not the protocol?

           16    A.      Right, there was nothing emergent.

           18                   (Whereupon, P-6 was marked for

           19    identification.)

           20                       - - -

           21    BY MR. INSCHO:

           22    Q.      I'm showing you what's been marked as P-6.

           23    These are a series of statements which have been

           24    produced to the plaintiff and I believe a similar set

                                                                     123




            1    were given to me this morning although I'm not entirely

            2    sure from Prime Care.

            3                   MR. NINOSKY:  I can't guarantee you

            4    what we --

            5                   MR. INSCHO:  I get it.

            6                   MR. NINOSKY:  -- had versus the County

            7    so...

            8                   MR. INSCHO:  I get it.

            9                   MR. NINOSKY:  So I'd say similar,

           10    correct, can't guarantee the same.

           11    BY MR. INSCHO:

           12    Q.      So there's a reference on Page 66 to a Nurse

           13    Jen coming to the cell floor.  Who is Jen -- Nurse Jen,

           14    if you know?

           15    A.      Jen Acker.

           16    Q.      A-C --

           17    A.      A-C-K-E-R.

           18    Q.      Is she still employed at Prime Care?

           19    A.      Yes.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   And then last line here at

           22    approx...8:12 Nurse Sam informed me that the dispensary

           23    was notified by fax that inmate Adami was deceased.

           24    Did you take a call or get a fax that indicated

                                                                     124




            1    Mr. Adami was deceased?

            2    A.      Yes, it says that I got a fax.

            3    Q.      All right.

            4                   So that is your -- that's you, you're

            5    Nurse Sam?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7    Q.      All right.

            8                   So what was the fax?

            9    A.      The fax I would have gotten would have been

           10    from the emergency room.  They send us over the ER

           11    summary of what they did, you know, if the person is

           12    being admitted or if they're sending them back or if

           13    they were deceased.

           14    Q.      Is that standard that anyone who gets sent to

           15    the hospital the ER will fax over the summary?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      Go to Bates number Bucks Adami 000069, is this

           18    a statement that you did?

           19    A.      Yes.

           20    Q.      So the S.D. would refer to your maiden name

           21    initials?

           22    A.      Yes.

           23    Q.      All right.

           24                   You wrote patient found unresponsive in

                                                                     125




            1    cell.  CPR initiated until EMS arrived.  AED applied.

            2    Sent to ER.

            3                   When did you write this statement?

            4    A.      After he left with the ambulance.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Let's go to the next one, this is Bates

            7    number 000070.  Is this also a statement you did?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      What did you write here?

           10    A.      CO Moran accompanied EMS to ER with patient.

           11    I ask CO about what happened during this event and he

           12    reported that EMS stated white powder was present in

           13    patient's nose.

           14    Q.      When did you write this statement?

           15    A.      It would have been after he passed because if

           16    the Officer is back from the ER then that means they

           17    passed.  So it would have been after that.

           18    Q.      Okay.

           19                   And what you're reporting here is

           20    something that -- not something you observed; is that

           21    fair?

           22    A.      Correct.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   Did you, in fact, perform CPR on

                                                                     126




            1    Mr. Adami?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Did you note any white powder or

            5    anything in his nose?

            6    A.      No.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   Were you the first person -- first

            9    medical provider on the scene?

           10    A.      Me, Jen and Deb showed up at the same time.

           11    Q.      Who is Deb?

           12    A.      Debra Buckman.

           13    Q.      Okay.

           14                   Did you conduct a primary survey when

           15    you arrived?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   Did you notice any indications of white

           19    powder anywhere on Mr. Adami's body during your primary

           20    survey?

           21    A.      No.

           22    Q.      Did you perform both breaths and compressions?

           23    A.      I did compressions.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     127




            1                   Compressions only?

            2    A.      Yes.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4    A.      I believe Jen and Deb alternated with the

            5    breathing.

            6    Q.      Did you stay until Mr. Adami was transported

            7    to the hospital?

            8    A.      No, EMS took over and they did CPR on him for

            9    quite some time and they took him to the hospital.

           10    Q.      And at some point you left the block during

           11    that period of time?

           12    A.      Yes, uh-huh.

           13    Q.      All right.

           14                   Did you give any other statements other

           15    than these two?

           16    A.      Not that I can recall.

           17    Q.      Did you speak to anyone from Bucks County

           18    about the events of Mr. Adami's death?

           19    A.      No.

           20    Q.      Did you ever speak to anyone who actually

           21    observed white powder in Mr. Adami's nose?

           22    A.      No, because it was EMS that apparently

           23    reported it.  So if they noticed that on their

           24    observation it was after they took over CPR and they

                                                                     128




            1    would have assessed it and seen it.

            2    Q.      I'm sorry, you missed my question, I think.

            3    A.      I'm sorry.

            4    Q.      Did you ever speak to anyone who saw white

            5    powder on Mr. Adami's nose?

            6    A.      Oh, no.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8                   You document in your statement

            9    essentially thirdhand knowledge of something that EMS

           10    told Moran who told you and then you wrote the

           11    statement; is that right?

           12    A.      Yes, yes.

           13    Q.      The term case manager in the reception unit

           14    that is not you; is that right?

           15    A.      Correct.

           16    Q.      That would refer to someone who sits between,

           17    if I understand the geography, between the intake unit

           18    and where your -- I'm sorry, the holding unit and where

           19    you do the intakes; is that right?

           20    A.      Yes.

           21    Q.      Do you know who the case manager in the

           22    reception unit would have been that day?

           23    A.      No, I don't know.

           24    Q.      They're not a Prime Care person; is that

                                                                     129




            1    right?

            2    A.      Correct.

            3                   MR. INSCHO:  Okay, let's take a quick

            4    break.  I am getting close to the end but if you need

            5    to eat I completely understand.

            6                   THE WITNESS:  That's fine.  I rather

            7    just bang it out and be done.

            8                   THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record,

           11                   (Whereupon, a brief break was taken at

           12    this time.)

           15    record, 1:11.

           16    BY MR. INSCHO:

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   I want to go back -- I want to ask a

           19    couple more questions about the conversation with Nurse

           20    Practitioner Champlin.

           21                   Do you have any independent

           22    recollection of that conversation?

           23    A.      No.

           24    Q.      Any notes of that conversation?

                                                                     130




            1    A.      No.

            2    Q.      In the typical --

            3                   MR. NINOSKY:  You mean other than the

            4    verbal order --

            5                   MR. INSCHO:  Yeah.

            6                   MR. NINOSKY:  -- that we talked about?

            7                   MR. INSCHO:  Yeah.

            8    BY MR. INSCHO:

            9    Q.      Is there standard practice for that

           10    conversation tell me what you would have told Nurse

           11    Practitioner Champlin?

           12    A.      I would have told her his gender, age, any

           13    substances he's using, any meds he's prescribed, any

           14    medical history he has.  I would have also reviewed the

           15    chart to see if there was anything of any importance

           16    from past incarcerations with us that are red flags, in

           17    which case there weren't.  I also would have said what

           18    his vitals were and how he's presenting.

           19    Q.      And when you say how he's presenting what do

           20    you mean by that?

           21    A.      If there's anything concerning going on, you

           22    know, he's lethargic, he's vomiting in front of me,

           23    he's disoriented, things like that.

           24    Q.      Uh-huh.

                                                                     131




            1                   Would you have told her that his

            2    behavior was described as inappropriate and that he was

            3    stumbling?

            4    A.      Yes, I would have said what I wrote that he

            5    appears tired.

            6    Q.      I believe -- did I see the word stumbling?

            7    A.      Yes, and I wrote also tired.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Would you have told her he was

           10    stumbling?

           11    A.      Yes, I said that he appears very tired.  It's

           12    typical for that time of day.  And he didn't appear

           13    ill, he just appeared tired.

           14    Q.      I mean, focusing on the stumbling --

           15    A.      Uh-huh.

           16    Q.      You agree with me most people aren't stumbling

           17    at 7:30 in the morning?

           18                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           19                   THE WITNESS:  In my experience when the

           20    inmates come in they've been awake all night whether

           21    it's from their drug use that keeps them up or because

           22    they've been in a holding cell at the police station

           23    for hours on end or they got arrested late at night or

           24    a combination of all of them.  So it is very common for

                                                                     132




            1    them to be exhausted when they come in in the morning

            2    time.

            3    BY MR. INSCHO:

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   Fatigue could also be a symptom of

            6    opiate withdrawal, correct?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      And Mr. Adami was going through opiate

            9    withdrawal, correct?

           10                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           11                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           12    BY MR. INSCHO:

           13    Q.      And would you agree with me that you would

           14    expect someone who used two bundles of heroin a day to

           15    go through detox symptoms, correct?

           16                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form, you

           17    can answer if you have an understanding.

           18                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           19    BY MR. INSCHO:

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21                   And are you telling me that, generally

           22    speaking, you did not attribute his stumbling and

           23    fatigue to a detox?

           24    A.      He was alert and oriented.  He was able to

                                                                     133




            1    answer questions.  He was coherent.  He made

            2    appropriate eye contact.  He wasn't slurring.  His

            3    neurological assessment based on that was normal.  From

            4    what I remember his previous detox checks from previous

            5    incarcerations said that a normal detox symptom for him

            6    was being just tired.  So there was nothing unusual

            7    about him being tired to me.  He was again coherent,

            8    alert, oriented, able to answer questions, able to

            9    offer up information to me about his medical history

           10    and his symptoms, everything of that nature.

           11    Q.      Did you attribute the fact the man was

           12    stumbling to the fact that he was going through detox?

           13    A.      It could be a bunch of things.  It could be

           14    he's tired or it could be detox.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   You didn't know one way or the other,

           17    correct?

           18    A.      Correct.

           19    Q.      All right.

           20                   He told you he was vomiting and

           21    vomiting is a symptom of detox, correct?

           22    A.      Yes, amongst other things.

           23    Q.      Well, did you think he had anything else wrong

           24    with him?

                                                                     134




            1                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            2                   THE WITNESS:  I'm not an x-ray machine.

            3    I'm not a CAT scan machine.  It could be a variety of

            4    things.  When they come in on intake it could be

            5    anything.

            6    BY MR. INSCHO:

            7    Q.      If you suspected, Nurse, that he had something

            8    wrong with him that was causing him to vomit other than

            9    going through detox, it would have been your job to

           10    follow-up on that, right?

           11                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

           12                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           13    BY MR. INSCHO:

           14    Q.      Okay.

           15                   And you didn't follow-up on him having

           16    any other condition that could have been causing

           17    vomiting, correct?

           18    A.      There were no other -- there was no other

           19    signs or symptoms of anything going on.

           20    Q.      No indication the guy had the flu or a stomach

           21    bug or anything like that, right?

           22    A.      Right.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   But what he did have was a significant

                                                                     135




            1    heroin addiction that he was now detoxing from,

            2    correct?

            3                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form as to

            4    significant, you can answer the question if you can.

            5    BY MR. INSCHO:

            6    Q.      I'll withdraw the question and I'll ask you do

            7    you have an understanding as a nurse who has worked in

            8    the Bucks County Correctional Facility where the

            9    majority of the patients you see at intake have

           10    substance issues do you have an understanding as to

           11    what is a lot of heroin or not a lot of heroin for

           12    someone to be using?

           13    A.      Yes, but it depends on the person.  Someone

           14    with a low BMI which he didn't have they're going to

           15    detox a lot harder, you know, they could use a small

           16    amount and it could be worse for them.  Everybody again

           17    is different with how they -- you know, their use,

           18    what's a lot to them or what isn't.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Is two bundles of heroin a significant

           21    amount of drug use?

           22    A.      It could be for a person.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   Do you know what his BMI was?

                                                                     136




            1    A.      It was not low.  It wasn't concerningly low.

            2    Q.      Was he a heavy guy?

            3    A.      He was average.

            4    Q.      Was he a tall guy?

            5    A.      Yes.

            6    Q.      Okay.

            7                   What was his weight do you remember

            8    what it was from the records?

            9    A.      I could look in the records and tell you.  But

           10    I know that when I'm reporting his vitals and

           11    everything and his weight if it was a low BMI I would

           12    have noted that.  I would have told them that over the

           13    phone.  I would have put it as well in a task for the

           14    provider when they see them, physically.  I would have

           15    made that known because a low BMI can indicate a harder

           16    detox.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   Following through on that, an average

           19    BMI -- if someone has a large -- if someone is heavy

           20    they have an easier detox is that your -- is that the

           21    association?

           22    A.      Typically, yes.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   So if someone is heavier or if someone

                                                                     137




            1    is average or if someone is lighter that will affect

            2    how they detox; is that right?

            3    A.      Yes, yes.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   And you would describe Mr. Adami as

            6    average; is that right?

            7    A.      Yes.

            8    Q.      Okay.

            9                   Did you ask him when he started

           10    vomiting?

           11    A.      No.

           12    Q.      Did you ask him how many times he vomited?

           13    A.      No.

           14    Q.      Did you ask him where he had vomited?

           15    A.      No.

           16    Q.      Did you ask him the nature of the vomiting,

           17    what color it was?

           18    A.      No.

           19    Q.      How much?

           20    A.      No.

           21    Q.      Did you ask him if anything made it better,

           22    anything made it worse?

           23    A.      No.

           24    Q.      Okay.

                                                                     138




            1                   Did you tell Nurse Practitioner

            2    Champlin that Mr. Adami had said he had been vomiting?

            3    A.      I would have, yes.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   Would you have told her the description

            6    that he gave you of his drug use, that being 7 days a

            7    week, two bundles?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Is there any other information -- pertinent

           10    information you would have supplied to Nurse Champlin

           11    during your telephone call with her?

           12    A.      Again, it would have been his age, his vitals,

           13    how he's presenting, what he's reporting, his past

           14    history that we had documented from past

           15    incarcerations, his medical history or anything that

           16    he's reporting this time.  I would have noted -- I

           17    forget if I said already what he was using and how

           18    much, when he last used and his vitals, his weight, any

           19    medications he's prescribed or taking and I think

           20    that's it.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   Do you have access to medications at

           23    intake?

           24    A.      We would have to leave the intake department

                                                                     139




            1    and go to the med room which is at the other end of the

            2    jail or have someone bring them up to us.  They are not

            3    in the intake room.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5                   I want to direct your attention up

            6    there.

            7                   I'm going to show you portions of the

            8    security video from Mr. Adami's module on the day of

            9    his death.

           10                   This day you would have come in at or

           11    around 6:30 in the morning; is that right?

           12    A.      6:00 a.m.

           13    Q.      6:00 a.m., okay, thank you.

           14    A.      Yeah.

           15    Q.      All right.

           16                   Are you able to read the time up here

           17    where it says 06:35:40?

           18    A.      Yes.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20                   Do you know or recognize who that

           21    officer is right there?

           22    A.      Yes, it's Officer Gresko.

           23    Q.      Thank you.

           24                   Would you know the names of any of

                                                                     140




            1    these inmates if I asked you?

            2    A.      The one on the stairs I'm drawing a blank on

            3    it.  I know him.  If you said his name I would know it.

            4    Q.      Okay.

            5    A.      He's been there a lot.  Yeah, the bald one,

            6    too, but I can't remember his name, right there, the

            7    one standing in front.

            8    Q.      Looking at the individuals that are coming in

            9    to the unit now there's this guard right there?

           10    A.      Uh-huh, it's Officer Atiles.

           11    Q.      Okay, thank you.

           12    A.      Uh-huh.

           13    Q.      And the individuals we see coming in now --

           14    A.      That's me.

           15    Q.      -- you are the person carrying the red bag?

           16    A.      Yes.

           17    Q.      Okay.

           18                   And the person pushing the chair?

           19    A.      That's Nurse Debra Buckman.

           20    Q.      The guard following her?

           21    A.      I believe that is still Officer Gresko and the

           22    one behind him is Officer Yerger.

           23    Q.      How do you spell that?

           24    A.      Y-E-R-G-E-R.

                                                                     141




            1    Q.      Okay.

            2    A.      There's Gramiak.

            3    Q.      Okay, that's Bruce Gramiak in the white?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   Why does someone wear white?

            7    A.      They're just not in their jumper.  They were

            8    probably sleeping and took it off.  It's just their

            9    white T-shirt and gym shorts, like an undershirt.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   This gentleman who walked in here who

           12    is that?

           13    A.      Nottingham, he was a Sergeant at the time, now

           14    he's a Lieutenant.

           15    Q.      Okay.

           16                   There are some more people who are

           17    going to be entering right now.  There's someone

           18    pushing in a wheelchair it looks like?

           19    A.      Yes, that's Yerger again.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21    A.      He went -- it looks like he went and grabbed

           22    it for us.

           23    Q.      And we have this gentleman walking in and

           24    putting on gloves, do you know who that is?

                                                                     142




            1    A.      Arbaugh.

            2    Q.      Is that A --

            3    A.      A-R-B-A-U-G-H.

            4    Q.      A couple guys just walked in.  One's an

            5    African American guy wearing a hat, do you know who

            6    that is?

            7    A.      It looks like Officer Mander, M-A-N-D-E-R.  I

            8    don't remember if he was Sergeant or not at the time.

            9    He's a Sergeant now.

           10    Q.      Okay.

           11                   And the gentleman behind him with the

           12    bald head?

           13    A.      Can you rewind a little bit.  They're like all

           14    bald with beards, sorry.

           15    Q.      No, no, no, that's totally fine.

           16    A.      I think that's still -- no, I think that might

           17    be Officer -- that's Officer Amate, A-M-A-T-E.

           18    Q.      And I meant to ask you about that guy at

           19    40:28, the guy who ran in?

           20    A.      He was a blur.

           21    Q.      Yeah.

           22    A.      That might be Yerger again if you can get him

           23    not running.

           24    Q.      I will go back and watch the guy that's

                                                                     143




            1    running in.

            2    A.      Yeah, it looks like it could be Yerger again.

            3    Q.      What's that in his hand is that the AED?

            4    A.      Yes.

            5    Q.      Okay.

            6                   There's a gentleman that's going to

            7    come in on the right-hand side of the frame who is on

            8    the telephone.  If you can identify him for me I'd

            9    appreciate it.

           10    A.      Uh-huh, that's Nottingham.

           11    Q.      Jumping ahead, okay, we're at 06:50:55, and I

           12    think the paramedics are going to enter?

           13    A.      Uh-huh.

           14                   MR. NINOSKY:  Is that a yes?

           15                   THE WITNESS:  Yes, sorry.

            7    Q.      Okay.

            8    A.      All three of us are in the cell.

            9    Q.      Jumping ahead, the guy with the papers on the

           10    table that's Sergeant at the time Nottingham?

           11    A.      Yes.

           12    Q.      Okay.

           13                   And that individual right there

           14    carrying the red bag who is that?

           15    A.      Debra Buckman.  She was wearing her sweater

           16    earlier in the video.

           17    Q.      Okay, all right.

           18                   You said there were three of you there

           19    from medical, you, Ms. Buckman and Jen?

           20    A.      Yeah, she was in the video you passed over.

           21    Q.      Did she enter with you or afterwards?

           22    A.      After me and Deb.

           23    Q.      Okay.

           24                   She would have been wearing a medical

                                                                     145




            1    uniform?

            2    A.      Yes, she would have been wearing scrubs of

            3    some sort.  She had her hair pulled back and glasses.

            4    Q.      Where was she assigned that day?

            5    A.      She was the night shift nurse leaving for her

            6    shift but had not left yet obviously.

            7    Q.      Is there a half an hour of overlap?

            8    A.      Yes.

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   So the night shift ends at 6:30?

           11    A.      Correct.

           12    Q.      You start at 6:00?

           13    A.      Yes.

           14    Q.      All right.

           15                   Did you go back and look through

           16    Mr. Adami's records at any time after he died?

           17    A.      Yeah, just to make sure that I hadn't missed

           18    anything or that's all.

           19    Q.      When did you do that?

           20    A.      When the event occurred.

           21    Q.      That day or within a few days?

           22    A.      That day.

           23    Q.      Did you make any additions to the records at

           24    that time?

                                                                     146




            1    A.      No, just what -- just about the event, that's

            2    all.

            3    Q.      Okay.

            4                   Did you speak with anyone about the

            5    medical care that Mr. Adami received after he left

            6    intake?

            7    A.      No.

            8    Q.      Did you speak with anyone who would have seen

            9    him on any detox checks or medical administration or

           10    medication administration?

           11    A.      You mean after intake but before he passed

           12    or...

           13    Q.      Yeah.

           14    A.      No, not that I can recall.

           15    Q.      During your time at Bucks County Correctional

           16    Facility had there been any changes to the watch

           17    procedures that you're aware of?

           18    A.      To the procedures I'm not sure.

           19    Q.      Okay.

           20    A.      I mean, no, I don't think so.

           21    Q.      Okay.

           22                   And again, those watch procedures are

           23    largely administered by the security?

           24    A.      Yeah, in terms of how they're carried out,

                                                                     147




            1    yeah.  So I don't know about their protocols or how --

            2    yeah, I don't know.

            3    Q.      Is it your understanding that I think you told

            4    me this a couple of times that that watch is done every

            5    30 minutes?

            6    A.      Yes.

            7                   MR. NINOSKY:  The regular watch

            8    medical?

            9                   THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           10    BY MR. INSCHO:

           11    Q.      RWM?

           12    A.      Yeah.

           13    Q.      Other than what you've told me had there been

           14    any changes you're aware of since Mr. Adami's death

           15    regarding the detox protocol?

           16    A.      No.

           17    Q.      Any changes regarding the intake process?

           18    A.      No, not that I can recall.

           19    Q.      Do you still use the same forms the screenings

           20    for intake today that you used in January of 2018?

           21    A.      Yes.

           22    Q.      Are there any additional questions surrounding

           23    drug use, detox or detox symptoms that have been added

           24    to the intake process?

                                                                     148




            1    A.      No.

            2    Q.      Any change in how medications are ordered,

            3    meaning, that the protocol remains that it's the end of

            4    the intake shift that those medications are ordered?

            5                   MR. NINOSKY:  Object to the form.

            6                   THE WITNESS:  Correct, unless it's

            7    urgent.

            8    BY MR. INSCHO:

            9    Q.      Okay.

           10                   How many times have you been involved

           11    with an inmate in withdrawal from opiates at the Bucks

           12    County Correctional Facility that is sent to the

           13    hospital?

           14    A.      I have no idea.

           15    Q.      I mean, is it more than 10, less than 10, I

           16    don't remember?

           17    A.      I really don't know.  Because sometimes we

           18    send them out and we don't know if it's due to

           19    withdrawal or not, it's hard to say.

           20    Q.      Okay.

           21    A.      I have no idea.

           22    Q.      Can you think of any time where you sent

           23    someone to the emergency department and I understand

           24    the provider may be involved because of detox symptoms?

                                                                     149




            1    A.      Yes, I don't remember a specific time but I

            2    know it's happened.

            3    Q.      Since you can't remember any specific time,

            4    generally, what were the symptoms?

            5    A.      I don't know that's -- I have no idea.  It

            6    wouldn't be just symptoms.  It would be that they're

            7    not drinking and they're dehydrated because they're not

            8    drinking and so we send them out, something like that.

            9    Q.      Do you have any understanding as to why

           10    Gatorade was added to the detox protocol?

           11    A.      A lot of the inmates don't like the water.  So

           12    it encourages them to drink more fluids.

           13    Q.      So you went from tap water to Gatorade because

           14    they didn't like the taste of the water?

           15    A.      They typically will tell you when we're

           16    educating them about adequate hydration they'll tell

           17    you that they don't like the water.  So we obviously

           18    educate them about the importance of water but we also

           19    at the same time offer them Gatorade while they're

           20    getting their detox checks just as an added way of

           21    hydrating.

           22    Q.      And how are they provided Gatorade, just how

           23    is that done?

           24    A.      In cups.

                                                                     150




            1    Q.      Like yeah, I guess --

            2    A.      When they go -- when the nurse goes to the

            3    block to do detox checks they have a gigantic -- it's

            4    like a two gallon jug of Gatorade that they take with

            5    them and they do the person's detox check, offer them a

            6    few cups of Gatorade and that's it.

            7                   MR. INSCHO:  Just same thing I said to

            8    John outside, I don't think I put this on the record,

            9    but, you know, we received this morning the initial

           10    disclosures from Prime Care.  We've agreed to do this

           11    deposition to accommodate the witness.  And you know,

           12    I'm reserving the right because I did not have the

           13    opportunity to review the chart as it was produced

           14    today I am reserving the right to recall this witness

           15    if, in fact, there is additional information provided

           16    to us in that chart today that was not provided

           17    previously.

           18                   MR. NINOSKY:  And all information that

           19    you would have been provided in what was provided to

           20    you before suit is consistent with what you've already

           21    been provided.  So obviously, if you want to re-depose

           22    this witness we'll talk about it, but I'm not going to

           23    agree to it as we sit here today.

           24                   MR. INSCHO:  And with that, I don't

                                                                     151




            1    have any further questions.

            2                   Do you have any Brett?

            3                   MR. WALDRON:  No, sir, thank you.

            4                   MR. NINOSKY:  No questions.

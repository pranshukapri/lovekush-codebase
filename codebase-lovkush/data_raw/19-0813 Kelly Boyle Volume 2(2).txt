 2                 (Proceedings resumed at 1:39 p.m.)                       13:59:03

 3                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on the                    13:39:40

 4  record at 1:39 p.m.                                                     13:39:41

 5                 MR. SIMONS:  When we left, I think there                 13:39:47

 6  were a number of items that you were going to look at.                  13:39:53

 7  Are we going to go back to those?                                       13:39:56

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Yes.                                         13:40:00

 9                 MR. SIMONS:  Okay.                                       13:40:01

10                 MR. SAMMI:  You had identified to us                     13:40:01

11  items on our privilege log that you had further                         13:40:02

12  questions on.  We, the lawyers, have gone back and tried                13:40:05

13  to look at those on our own, and so what we'll do is if                 13:40:08

14  you'd like to go through them with the witness, you can                 13:40:13

15  go through with the witness, and she can add any                        13:40:16

16  non-privileged information that you may be entitled to.                 13:40:18

17  Otherwise, she's not going to obviously provide --                      13:40:20

18                 MR. SIMONS:  Sure.                                       13:40:26

19                 MR. SAMMI:  -- any attorney-client                       13:40:26

20  privileged information.                                                 13:40:27

21                 MR. SIMONS:  Not a problem.                              13:40:28

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I think if you go back to                    13:40:29

23  Exhibit 220.  And the next item that we were going to                   13:40:32

24  look at was item 158, I believe, which was on page 25, I                13:40:37

25  believe.                                                                13:40:40

 1       A    The first 25?                                                 13:40:41

 2       Q    The first 25, 25A.                                            13:40:42

 3                 And the question is simply do you know                   13:40:50

 4  which contract this refers to?                                          13:40:53

 5       A    That would have been -- actually, I'm not                     13:41:16

 6  sure.                                                                   13:41:21

 7       Q    Okay.  What about number 209?  This is on page                13:41:21

 8  33, February 9th, 2018.                                                 13:41:37

 9       A    That would have been the SOW --                               13:41:45

10       Q    Okay.                                                         13:41:47

11       A    -- with Zest.                                                 13:41:47

12       Q    All right.                                                    13:41:51

13                 MR. SAMMI:  2018?                                        13:41:52

14                 THE WITNESS:  2018.                                      13:41:55

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.                                        13:41:58

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So if we go forward to number                13:42:00

17  297.  297 is on the 13th page, the second 13.  It looks                 13:42:01

18  like 297 is -- actually, I --                                           13:42:21

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah.                                        13:42:26

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  298 through 301.                             13:42:26

21                 MR. SAMMI:  I --                                         13:42:29

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  297 is Mr. Bohling.                          13:42:30

23                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah.  Michael, I understood                 13:42:32

24  you to mean 298 through 301.                                            13:42:34

25                 MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.  That is correct.                     13:42:38
                                                         161



 1       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So these refer to a Deloitte                 13:42:41

 2  contract.  Do you know which Deloitte this was?  Was it                 13:42:43

 3  waste, speed?                                                           13:42:48

 4       A    Speed.                                                        13:42:49

 5       Q    Speed.  Okay.                                                 13:42:50

 6                 All right.  And then going forward to                    13:42:52

 7  326, page 17.  This is the one, I think, that we had                    13:42:56

 8  spoken briefly about before.  I think, you said you have                13:43:06

 9  not -- you haven't sought to obtain a patent or file a                  13:43:12

10  patent application that you can recall?                                 13:43:17

11       A    I can't recall that, no.                                      13:43:19

12       Q    Did this have to do with somebody else's                      13:43:23

13  patent, not your own?                                                   13:43:25

14       A    I don't remember.                                             13:43:28

15       Q    Okay.  What about No. 327 through 31, next                    13:43:29

16  page, page 18?  These all just say regarding                            13:43:35

17  intellectual property.  Do you have anymore detail on                   13:43:42

18  what this relates to?                                                   13:43:46

19       A    No.  I don't remember.                                        13:43:48

20       Q    Okay.  What about 358 and 59?  It's on page                   13:43:53

21  23.  Business ventures, 1/18/2018.  Do you know what                    13:44:03

22  that refers to?                                                         13:44:12

23       A    That would have been the SOW.                                 13:44:13

24       Q    Okay.  All right.                                             13:44:15

25       A    Okay.  Go.                                                    13:44:32
                                                         162



 1       Q    Yeah.  We'll get to it in a little bit, 221.                  13:44:34

 2                  (Exhibit 221 was marked)                                13:44:43

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Michael, this deposition is                  13:44:44

 4  still under individual capacity?                                        13:44:52

 5                 MR. SIMONS:  Yes.                                        13:44:55

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.                                        13:44:57

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Besides the exhibit, did you                 13:44:59

 8  talk to Zest about the work that ATK was doing with you?                13:45:00

 9       A    I do not remember specific conversations.                     13:45:08

10       Q    Okay.  So you don't recall telling them about                 13:45:11

11  the ATK work?                                                           13:45:13

12       A    Not right now.                                                13:45:16

13       Q    Okay.  Looking at 221, this is a series of                    13:45:17

14  emails about an ATK proposal.  Your email is at the very                13:45:29

15  top there, 12/2/2016, correct?                                          13:45:36

16       A    Yes.                                                          13:45:40

17       Q    And it looks like ATK sent a proposal back in                 13:45:41

18  2015.  If you look at the --                                            13:45:48

19       A    Yep.                                                          13:45:50

20       Q    -- first couple of emails.  And then that was                 13:45:51

21  -- I guess, they did not do the work in 2015, correct?                  13:45:54

22       A    I would -- was not employed.  I don't know                    13:45:58

23  what they did.                                                          13:46:00

24       Q    Okay.  Well, at the top, you say, This was the                13:46:01

25  ATK deck I referenced.  This is a proposal to do the                    13:46:04
                                                         163



 1  work that we are looking to do.  Not the actual work.                   13:46:09

 2  Just a proposal to do the work and the scope.  Correct?                 13:46:12

 3       A    That's correct.                                               13:46:16

 4       Q    Okay.  So you're not aware of them having done                13:46:17

 5  the work in 2015, correct?                                              13:46:19

 6       A    I'm not aware of what they did in 2015.                       13:46:21

 7       Q    Okay.  And it looks like you were sending the                 13:46:25

 8  proposal around again in 2016.  Did you send it around                  13:46:27

 9  because you were planning to have them do some work in                  13:46:31

10  2016?                                                                   13:46:35

11       A    This -- no.                                                   13:46:39

12       Q    Why did you send it around?                                   13:46:42

13       A    It just says it's a proposal of the work we're                13:46:44

14  looking to do.  It does not specifically say work that                  13:46:48

15  I'm looking ATK to do.                                                  13:46:51

16       Q    Got it.  Did you eventually ask ATK to do work                13:46:54

17  that was similar to the proposal that you circulated?                   13:46:58

18       A    Massively different scope and not necessarily                 13:47:03

19  even remotely related.                                                  13:47:10

20       Q    Okay.  So the only connection, I guess, is it                 13:47:14

21  was ATK?                                                                13:47:16

22       A    Correct.                                                      13:47:20

23                  (Exhibit 222 was marked)                                13:47:20

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm showing you what's                    13:47:20

25  been marked as Exhibit 222.                                             13:47:36
                                                         164



 1       A    Yes.                                                          13:47:39

 2       Q    This is an email from you to Mr. Cherian in                   13:47:44

 3  April of 2017 with an attachment called, Architectural                  13:47:47

 4  Design Considerations Overview.                                         13:47:58

 5       A    Correct.                                                      13:48:00

 6       Q    Is this something that ATK helped you prepare                 13:48:01

 7  or produce?                                                             13:48:04

 8       A    This entire document?                                         13:48:12

 9       Q    Yes.  Did they help you prepare the entire                    13:48:14

10  document?  And if not, did they help you prepare a                      13:48:19

11  portion of it?                                                          13:48:25

12       A    So this is not my document, as I recall.                      13:48:33

13       Q    So whose is it?                                               13:48:41

14       A    I'm not sure where it would have originated.                  13:48:47

15       Q    So if you look at the email just before your                  13:48:52

16  email on the first page.                                                13:48:54

17       A    Uh-huh.                                                       13:48:57

18       Q    It's from Lewis -- Justin Lewis at ATK.                       13:48:58

19       A    Yes.                                                          13:49:03

20       Q    It looks like he sent it to you, and then you                 13:49:03

21  sent it to Mr. Cherian.                                                 13:49:09

22       A    He sent it to a large group of people.                        13:49:09

23       Q    Right.  You plus a number of people, correct?                 13:49:12

24       A    Yes.                                                          13:49:12

25       Q    And then you forwarded it on to Mr. Cherian.                  13:49:12
                                                         165



 1  Why did you sent it to Mr. Cherian?                                     13:49:15

 2       A    I'm sure as an FYI.                                           13:49:21

 3       Q    So does that refresh your recollection at all                 13:49:23

 4  as to whether ATK was involved in helping prepare this                  13:49:26

 5  material?                                                               13:49:31

 6       A    At least what I see here, they prepared this                  13:49:32

 7  material.                                                               13:49:35

 8       Q    Okay.  And did they prepare it at your request                13:49:36

 9  or at someone else's request?                                           13:49:39

10       A    This is when ATK was working and being paid                   13:49:41

11  for by someone other than me.                                           13:49:44

12       Q    Okay.  Do you know who it was that was --                     13:49:47

13       A    Rob Fasillo.                                                  13:49:50

14       Q    Rob Fasillo.  And who is he?                                  13:49:53

15       A    He's the second person on the email list.                     13:49:55

16       Q    Right.  And what is his role at Walmart?                      13:49:58

17       A    He's a VP in technology.  His role at this                    13:50:03

18  particular time, I'm not sure.                                          13:50:07

19       Q    Okay.  And did you work with Rob Fasillo after                13:50:09

20  this material was prepared?                                             13:50:12

21       A    During.  Current -- yeah.                                     13:50:16

22       Q    Okay.                                                         13:50:17

23       A    Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                             13:50:16

24       Q    What role did you have in working with Rob                    13:50:19

25  with regard to the exhibit in Exhibit 222?                              13:50:21
                                                         166



 1       A    I was the business partner.                                   13:50:25

 2       Q    Okay.  And in connection with that, did ATK                   13:50:27

 3  provide any other reports or deliverables associated                    13:50:33

 4  with this project?                                                      13:50:39

 5       A    Yes.                                                          13:50:43

 6       Q    What were the other deliverables that they                    13:50:43

 7  provided?                                                               13:50:43

 8       A    There was the -- at the end of their contract                 13:50:47

 9  or time, there was another larger deck.                                 13:50:56

10       Q    Okay.  And what was the -- was that an                        13:50:59

11  expansion on this, the deck that's attached here or                     13:51:01

12  something entirely different?                                           13:51:06

13       A    I would say this was a subset.                                13:51:07

14       Q    Okay.  So it's just a bigger, more complete                   13:51:10

15  set.                                                                    13:51:13

16       A    (Witness nods head.)                                          13:51:14

17       Q    And what was your understanding of what the                   13:51:14

18  objective of this ATK work was?                                         13:51:16

19       A    As I mentioned earlier, evaluating the systems                13:51:20

20  that move our product.  They were inadequate.  And so we                13:51:26

21  did a full systems analysis of all the different domains                13:51:32

22  to see what was needed to have the correct digital                      13:51:41

23  connection of moving product.                                           13:51:47

24       Q    And when you say product, is that -- you're                   13:51:50

25  talking about fresh product because that's --                           13:51:53
                                                         167



 1       A    Any -- any kind of product because -- in this                 13:51:56

 2  world, it was fresh, but it sometimes is -- you know, it                13:52:02

 3  can be a can of something too.                                          13:52:06

 4       Q    But in this particular instance --                            13:52:08

 5       A    It was fresh.                                                 13:52:09

 6       Q    -- fresh --                                                   13:52:10

 7       A    Correct.                                                      13:52:11

 8       Q    -- because that's what you're responsible for?                13:52:11

 9       A    Yes.  That's correct.                                         13:52:14

10       Q    And in connection with this work, did you                     13:52:15

11  provide ATK with any materials to assist them in their                  13:52:17

12  analysis?                                                               13:52:20

13       A    So yes.                                                       13:52:23

14       Q    What materials did you provide them?                          13:52:25

15       A    I am not sure to the extent.  I just remember                 13:52:31

16  them needing information.                                               13:52:35

17       Q    Okay.                                                         13:52:37

18                  (Exhibit 223 was marked)                                13:52:38

19       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm showing you what's                    13:52:59

20  been marked as Exhibit 223.  Do you recall someone named                13:53:00

21  John Piatek at ATK?                                                     13:53:04

22       A    I do.                                                         13:53:07

23       Q    What was your working relationship with John?                 13:53:08

24       A    I believe he was working on the project.                      13:53:10

25       Q    Okay.  And it looks like at the top of this                   13:53:12

 1  email, Mr. Piatek is sending you something that's called                13:53:17

 2  an External Perspective Summary.  Is this the larger                    13:53:22

 3  deliverable that you referred to a moment ago?                          13:53:27

 4       A    I don't know if this is the final but this is                 13:53:39

 5  a larger version of the one before and it's later.                      13:53:43

 6       Q    Okay.  So there was -- this may be the final.                 13:53:47

 7  Maybe there's another one that's --                                     13:53:52

 8       A    Right.                                                        13:53:54

 9       Q    -- the later.  Would the latest one, the last                 13:53:55

10  date, be the one that would be the final?                               13:53:59

11       A    I would assume so.                                            13:54:01

12       Q    And if you turn to the page that's Bates                      13:54:15

13  labeled WM000021212.  It's kind of halfway through, my                  13:54:19

14  best guess.                                                             13:54:27

15       A    Yeah.                                                         13:54:29

16       Q    Page 36.  Did you provide any information to                  13:54:30

17  ATK related to this particular slide?                                   13:54:40

18       A    I would have absolutely no idea.                              13:54:43

19       Q    Okay.                                                         13:54:46

20       A    When we provided the information, it was                      13:54:46

21  typically early on.  This was many months later.  I                     13:54:49

22  don't know.                                                             13:54:53

23       Q    Okay.  So you wouldn't be able to say how the                 13:54:53

24  information you provided was ultimately integrated or                   13:54:55

25  used?                                                                   13:54:59

 1       A    Me, personally?  I didn't personally --                       13:54:59

 2       Q    Okay.                                                         13:55:02

 3       A    -- provide information that I can recall.                     13:55:03

 4       Q    Did your team provide information?                            13:55:05

 5       A    May have.                                                     13:55:09

 6       Q    Okay.                                                         13:55:11

 7       A    That's what I was speaking to.                                13:55:12

 8       Q    Got it.  And was there a meeting or some kind                 13:55:12

 9  of presentation that was done at the end of this process                13:55:15

10  with ATK to talk about their conclusions?                               13:55:17

11       A    I don't remember specifically.                                13:55:28

12       Q    What do you remember about this work, the work                13:55:31

13  that they did and the conclusions that they reached?                    13:55:38

14       A    They -- they validated the fact that our                      13:55:41

15  systems were not good.                                                  13:55:44

16       Q    Okay.  Anything else?  Did you need that kind                 13:55:45

17  of -- did you need that validation?                                     13:55:49

18       A    We did actually.                                              13:55:51

19       Q    Okay.                                                         13:55:52

20       A    They also specifically called out what needed                 13:55:55

21  to happen to upgrade those systems, so that we could be                 13:55:59

22  better at supply chain.                                                 13:56:05

23       Q    Got it.                                                       13:56:08

 1  email from Tiffany Benitez to Mr. Cherian and then                      13:56:57

 2  copying you and a few other people, correct?                            13:57:00

 3       A    Hold on a minute.                                             13:57:03

 4       Q    Sure.                                                         13:57:04

 5       A    I'm going to read this quickly.                               13:57:05

 6       Q    Yep.                                                          13:57:08

 7       A    Yes.                                                          13:57:52

 8       Q    And in the first sentence of the email, it                    13:57:52

 9  says, I have the most updated copy attached.  I believe                 13:57:56

10  it was sent to me by Manish a week ago.  None of the                    13:57:59

11  above charters that we have work in, except B1, have                    13:58:03

12  anyone listed.  I did add Josh Bohling for B1.  He was                  13:58:08

13  on that charter.                                                        13:58:13

14                 And my question is what is a charter at                  13:58:14

15  Walmart?                                                                13:58:17

16       A    At this point in time, the way that we managed                13:58:24

17  projects is when a concept was being explored, it would                 13:58:28

18  get a charter.                                                          13:58:34

19       Q    And is -- what was the purpose of having a                    13:58:36

20  charter?                                                                13:58:41

21       A    To identify work that was being explored.                     13:58:48

22       Q    And this suggests that you would have people                  13:58:51

23  listed on the charter.  Is that your understanding?                     13:58:53

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form and                        13:58:58

 1       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  It says, I did add Josh                      13:59:06

 2  Bohling for B1.  He was on that charter.                                13:59:08

 3       A    I don't know what she means by "on that                       13:59:11

 4  charter."  I don't know if he was named in the charter                  13:59:13

 5  or if he penned the charter.  I don't know.                             13:59:17

 6       Q    Okay.  And typically, have you done a charter                 13:59:19

 7  for some project?                                                       13:59:21

 8       A    I have not, huh-uh.                                           13:59:23

 9       Q    Is this the way that things are still done now                13:59:25

10  or --                                                                   13:59:28

11       A    No.                                                           13:59:30

12       Q    -- is there some difference?                                  13:59:30

13       A    Stage-Gate.                                                   13:59:32

14       Q    So what's a State Gate?                                       13:59:33

15       A    A Stage-Gate zero would be similar to a                       13:59:35

16  charter, where you would go and propose to work on                      13:59:38

17  something, so that you know whether or not it's okay to                 13:59:41

18  work on it.                                                             13:59:44

19       Q    Okay.                                                         13:59:45

20       A    It doesn't -- it doesn't mean you're working                  13:59:45

21  on it.  It doesn't -- it's a -- it's a initial -- should                13:59:48

22  we -- should we be looking at this.                                     13:59:53

23       Q    So would it be accurate to say that the                       13:59:57

24  charter would be -- at the time the charters were used                  14:00:00

25  or the initial document that would say, hey, this is                    14:00:05
                                                         172



 1  something we're looking at; it's okay for people to work                14:00:09

 2  on this?                                                                14:00:12

 3       A    It does not assume okay to work on.  It just                  14:00:12

 4  says we're looking at this.                                             14:00:16

 5       Q    Okay.  Is there anything that would come                      14:00:23

 6  before a charter?                                                       14:00:24

 7       A    Well, this process changed soon after this,                   14:00:26

 8  and I was new to it, so I don't know officially.                        14:00:29

 9       Q    Okay.  So your -- I guess a better question                   14:00:33

10  for you is are you aware of anything that would come                    14:00:36

11  before a charter?                                                       14:00:40

12       A    No.                                                           14:00:41

13       Q    And then -- so now, the process is Stage-Gate,                14:00:41

14  correct?                                                                14:00:44

15       A    Correct.                                                      14:00:45

16       Q    And the first thing in the Stage-Gate process                 14:00:45

17  is Stage-Gate 0?                                                        14:00:48

18       A    That's correct.                                               14:00:51

19       Q    Which I think you said was equivalent to the                  14:00:52

20  old charter, as far as you know.                                        14:00:52

21       A    Yes.                                                          14:00:57

22       Q    And are there other Stage-Gates?                              14:00:57

23       A    This is going to sound familiar.  Stage-Gate 1                14:00:59

24  is a POC.                                                               14:01:01

25       Q    Okay.                                                         14:01:03

 1       A    Stage-Gate 2 is a pilot.  Stage-Gate 3 is                     14:01:03

 2  deployment.  And Stage-Gate 4 would be post-pilot and                   14:01:08

 3  post-deployment analysis.                                               14:01:14

 4       Q    Post-pilot, post-deployment?                                  14:01:17

 6       Q    Got it.  So -- and is this process, does it                   14:01:23

 7  have to be followed in every instance?                                  14:01:34

 8       A    Yes.                                                          14:01:36

 9       Q    And when did this process get instituted,                     14:01:38

10  Stage-Gate process?                                                     14:01:42

11       A    It is something that Greg Smith brought to him                14:01:44

12  -- brought with him.  And so he came in December of '16,                14:01:47

13  I believe, so sometime after that.                                      14:01:54

14       Q    Is this a process that's only used in Greg                    14:01:57

15  Smith's organization or is it used across Walmart?                      14:02:00

16       A    It's used in other functions.  I don't believe                14:02:04

17  it's a standard.                                                        14:02:09

18       Q    Okay.  And is a standard something specific at                14:02:10

19  Walmart?                                                                14:02:12

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          14:02:15

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I'm just trying to                           14:02:16

22  understand, you said it's not a standard.  I was                        14:02:19

23  wondering are there some things at Walmart that are                     14:02:21

24  called standards that are required to be used across the                14:02:24

25  organization, some official --                                          14:02:26
                                                         174



 1       A    When I said standard, I mean, like, you and I                 14:02:28

 2  would use it.                                                           14:02:32

 3       Q    Okay.  Nothing -- doesn't have a special                      14:02:35

 4  meaning at Walmart?                                                     14:02:35

 5       A    No.                                                           14:02:37

 6       Q    Okay.  You're in Greg Smith's organization,                   14:02:37

 7  right?                                                                  14:02:39

 8       A    Yes.                                                          14:02:39

 9       Q    So this would apply to you?                                   14:02:39

10       A    Yes.                                                          14:02:42

11       Q    And the projects that you do?                                 14:02:42

12       A    That's correct.                                               14:02:44

13       Q    Okay.  When you do Stage-Gate 0 for a                         14:02:45

14  particular project, do you put together a document that                 14:03:06

15  describes what you're working on and how it's -- you                    14:03:09

16  know, sort of, what the proposal is?                                    14:03:15

17       A    That's correct.                                               14:03:17

18       Q    And is it --                                                  14:03:17

19       A    It -- so remember, still, it's not what you're                14:03:18

20  working on because you wouldn't go to Stage-Gate 0 with                 14:03:22

21  something you're already working on.                                    14:03:26

22       Q    Fair enough.                                                  14:03:28

23       A    So you would say here's something we're                       14:03:29

24  looking at.  Here's where we potentially see value.                     14:03:31

25  Should we put resources against this.                                   14:03:35

 1       Q    Got it.  And so for any projects that are                     14:03:38

 2  going on within your organization, we should see a                      14:03:42

 3  Stage-Gate process for those projects?                                  14:03:45

 4       A    Any time after mid-2017.                                      14:03:50

 5       Q    Fair point.  And is there, sort of, a central                 14:03:54

 6  repository for these types of document, the Stage-Gate                  14:04:02

 7  documents?                                                              14:04:06

 8       A    I have not seen it.                                           14:04:08

 9       Q    When you prepare -- well, let me step back.                   14:04:10

10  Have you prepared documents related to the Stage-Gate                   14:04:13

11  process?                                                                14:04:17

12       A    Yes.                                                          14:04:18

13       Q    Okay.  When you prepare them, what do you do                  14:04:18

14  with them?                                                              14:04:20

15       A    I present them in the supply chair SteerCo.                   14:04:21

16       Q    Okay.  And after that, what happens to them?                  14:04:25

17       A    The PMO, which is the project management                      14:04:28

18  office or program management office, they organize those                14:04:33

19  meetings.  I have no idea if they keep them or what.  I                 14:04:43

20  don't know what they do with them.                                      14:04:47

21       Q    Okay.  So when you bring them to the SteerCo,                 14:04:49

22  they go to the PMO and PMO is responsible for the                       14:04:52

23  Stage-Gate process?                                                     14:04:54

24       A    No.                                                           14:04:55

25       Q    Okay.                                                         14:04:56

 1       A    I put -- I prepare the documents.  I send them                14:04:56

 2  to the PMO.  They put them on the screen while I'm                      14:04:59

 3  speaking.  I get the approval or not, and we either move                14:05:03

 4  on or we ditch the idea.                                                14:05:11

 5       Q    Okay.  And if you get approval for Stage-Gate                 14:05:13

 6  0, you have to come back to the SteerCo for Gate 1, Gate                14:05:16

 7  2, Gate 3, Gate 4 --                                                    14:05:20

 8       A    Yes.                                                          14:05:23

 9       Q    -- each time?                                                 14:05:23

10       A    Yes.                                                          14:05:24

11       Q    So each time there's some kind of a document                  14:05:24

12  that would talk about the next Gate?                                    14:05:27

13       A    Yes.                                                          14:05:31

14       Q    Okay.  And the same process is used for each                  14:05:31

15  Gate?                                                                   14:05:36

16       A    In general, yes.                                              14:05:37

17       Q    Okay.  Do you have to go to another place,                    14:05:38

18  like, you have to get go to the Legacy committee or                     14:05:42

19  something like that for certain levels of Gating?  Or is                14:05:46

20  it all at the steering committee.                                       14:05:51

21       A    For the supply chain, you would need to go to                 14:05:57

22  supply chain.                                                           14:06:03

23       Q    Okay.  And if you wanted to find these Gate                   14:06:05

24  documents, where would -- would you go to the PMO?                      14:06:07

25  Would that be the first place that you would look if                    14:06:10
                                                         177



 1  you're trying to find them?                                             14:06:12

 2       A    I would look in my emails and in my files.                    14:06:15

 3       Q    Fair point.  But if you were looking for some                 14:06:17

 4  that were supply chain-related maybe that you didn't                    14:06:20

 5  prepare yourself.                                                       14:06:23

 6       A    I'd have no idea where I would go, unless I                   14:06:24

 7  knew the person who was running the project.  I would                   14:06:27

 8  just go to them.  Like I said before, I do not know of a                14:06:29

 9  repository of where we keep everything.                                 14:06:34

10       Q    Who is in charge of the supply chain PMO                      14:06:36

11  office or -- I don't know if it's an office or --                       14:06:39

12       A    Jeff England.                                                 14:06:41

14                  (Exhibit 225 was marked)                                14:06:57

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Look at what's been marked                   14:07:10

16  Exhibit 225.  An email from Terri Shiery to Yuri Castano                14:07:12

17  and -- probably going to butcher this name, Sreemoyee                   14:07:17

18  Som, dated March 23rd, 2017.  Did you work with Terri                   14:07:23

19  Shiery on ATK-related projects?                                         14:07:39

23       Q    Okay.  What was the working relationship                      14:07:55

24  between you and Terri with respect to work that ATK was                 14:07:57

25  doing?                                                                  14:08:01

 1       A    She -- so it was the body of work we talked                   14:08:03

 2  about earlier.                                                          14:08:06

12       Q    Do you know why she forwarded this information                14:08:38

 1  they could be sent to ATK to be part of the analysis?                   14:11:45

 2       A    No.                                                           14:11:49

 5       Q    So -- but it looks like if you look up in the                 14:11:58

 6  chain, that is what occurred, right?                                    14:12:01

 7       A    Hold on one second.                                           14:12:03

 9       A    That may be what occurred, yes.                               14:12:25

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  But you don't recall                  14:12:27

11  any conversations with Terri Shiery or Marsha David                     14:12:29

12  about sending these on to ATK?                                          14:12:33

13       A    I do not recall.                                              14:12:35

14       Q    Okay.  But it looks like they were sent to                    14:12:35

15  ATK, correct?                                                           14:12:37

16       A    Looks that way.                                               14:12:39

17       Q    Did you have any conversations with ATK about                 14:12:41

18  these RFI responses?                                                    14:12:44

20       Q    Okay.  Do you remember any analysis that ATK                  14:12:56

21  did related to these RFI responses?                                     14:13:00

22       A    I don't.                                                      14:13:04

23       Q    Was ATK part of the process of reviewing these                14:13:09

24  RFI responses or making decisions about these RFI                       14:13:13

25  responses?                                                              14:13:17

 1       A    Not that I have any recollection.                             14:13:18

 2       Q    Not that you're aware of?                                     14:13:21

 3       A    No.                                                           14:13:23

 4       Q    Did you ever tell Zest that the RFI responses                 14:13:24

 5  were being sent along to ATK?                                           14:13:28

 7       Q    Okay.  So naturally, you wouldn't have told                   14:13:31

 8  them if you didn't know they were, correct?                             14:13:35

12       Q    Yeah.  No.  The -- I guess if you didn't know                 14:13:44

13  they were, you wouldn't -- certainly wouldn't have told                 14:13:46

14  Zest that they were being sent along, right?                            14:13:50

22                 MR. SAMMI:  Yep.                                         14:14:44

 1  today emailed between you and Jon Fox, Stephen Steele                   14:15:06

 2  and Denise Sharpe, with the subject line:  Zest                         14:15:09

 3  confidential.  Please do not forward.  Right?                           14:15:11

 4       A    Correct.                                                      14:15:15

 5       Q    And in the email at the bottom of the first                   14:15:15

 6  page, which we looked at earlier, I want to focus on the                14:15:19

 7  first paragraph of that email.  It says in the third                    14:15:25

 8  sentence, We will give them 50 percent of their Deloitte                14:15:34

 9  investment, and we will give them a small consulting                    14:15:37

10  engagement for the first or second quarter, 25k-ish.  Do                14:15:40

11  you see that?                                                           14:15:47

12       A    Yes.                                                          14:15:48

13       Q    So the purpose of the statement of work in                    14:15:49

14  2018 was to give them 50 percent of their Deloitte                      14:15:52

15  investment back, right?                                                 14:15:56

16       A    Are you talking -- referring to this email or                 14:15:59

17  some other time?                                                        14:16:02

18       Q    No.  This email.                                              14:16:03

19       A    So this email does not say that.                              14:16:04

20       Q    Okay.  What does it say?                                      14:16:07

21       A    It just says we would give them money, and                    14:16:10

22  that they would work for 250.                                           14:16:13

23       Q    Okay.  How much was 50 percent of the Deloitte                14:16:16

24  investment?                                                             14:16:21

25       A    Approximately, one-and-a-half million.                        14:16:22
                                                         183



 1       Q    Okay.  And that was the ultimate amount for                   14:16:25

 2  the statement of work, right, was one-and-a-half                        14:16:29

 3  million?                                                                14:16:32

 4       A    That is correct.                                              14:16:33

 5       Q    Yeah.  There's a copy of it right there if you                14:16:33

 6  need to refer to it.                                                    14:16:36

 7       A    Yep.                                                          14:16:37

 8       Q    Yeah.                                                         14:16:37

 9       A    That happened after this.                                     14:16:39

10       Q    Okay.  So at this particular point in time,                   14:16:40

11  was it contemplated that there was going to be 1.75?                    14:16:43

12       A    There were two things that we were talking                    14:16:47

13  about.  One of them was a payment, one of them was work.                14:16:50

14       Q    Okay.  Or, at least, at this time, the payment                14:16:53

15  was 1.5, roughly, for half of the Deloitte investment,                  14:17:02

16  right?                                                                  14:17:09

17       A    So I don't know the specifics on how much the                 14:17:15

18  total was.  It could be that 50 percent was 1.5 and 250.                14:17:20

19  I don't know the specific math.  I could look at the                    14:17:28

20  contract and tell you -- the original Deloitte contact                  14:17:30

21  and tell you, but I know that in aggregate, I want part                 14:17:35

22  of the negotiations.  This is what was, at this point in                14:17:37

23  time, I was told you were going to do.                                  14:17:42

24       Q    Got it.  And who told you that?                               14:17:47

25       A    Ed Oldham.                                                    14:17:49

 1       Q    Okay.  Was he the one who was responsible for                 14:17:55

 2  making the decision regarding that --                                   14:17:55

 3       A    He did the negotiations.                                      14:17:56

 4       Q    Okay.  Do you know who -- what was Jon Fox's                  14:17:56

 5  role, if any?                                                           14:17:58

 6       A    He -- so after the negotiations, came to these                14:18:00

 7  conclusions.  We needed to -- let me back up.                           14:18:03

 8  Negotiations came to these conclusions.  Zest had                       14:18:12

 9  requested, instead of being just paid, to work.  So I                   14:18:16

10  had to go and ask around for work that Zest could do, so                14:18:23

11  we could accommodate their request.                                     14:18:32

12       Q    And did Jon Fox have some role in that?                       14:18:37

13       A    Uh-huh.                                                       14:18:40

14       Q    What was his role?                                            14:18:41

15       A    He gave me some ideas.                                        14:18:42

16       Q    Okay.  So Ed Oldham did the negotiations.  Who                14:18:44

17  ultimately made the decision of proving the negotiations                14:18:53

18  that Ed Oldham, if there was somebody besides him?                      14:19:01

19       A    So I would say that there was a recommendation                14:19:02

20  that came forward and it went through the hierarchy                     14:19:04

21  beyond Ed.                                                              14:19:09

22       Q    And --                                                        14:19:10

23       A    So Kath, Greg, Greg.                                          14:19:11

24       Q    And when you say Kath, you're saying Kathryn                  14:19:13

25  McLay?                                                                  14:19:16

 1       A    Correct.                                                      14:19:17

 2       Q    Greg is Greg Smith?                                           14:19:18

 3       A    Correct.                                                      14:19:19

 4       Q    And then Greg is Greg Foran?                                  14:19:19

 5       A    That's correct.                                               14:19:23

 6       Q    What about Ms. Sharpe, did she have any role                  14:19:24

 7  in this process?                                                        14:19:27

 8       A    The negotiation process?                                      14:19:29

 9       Q    The process related to the statement of work.                 14:19:31

10                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form.                              14:19:37

11       A    Creating the statement of work?                               14:19:38

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I -- I'm not sure.  Just the                 14:19:40

13  whole -- she's copied on some of these emails.  I'm just                14:19:43

14  curious if she played some role in the process.                         14:19:47

15       A    She was very engaged in Cold Chain, so I'm                    14:19:50

16  sure I was communicating to her what was going on.                      14:19:56

17       Q    Was it just to keep her up to speed?                          14:20:01

18       A    It looks that way.                                            14:20:14

19       Q    What about Stephen Steele.  Is that the same?                 14:20:16

20       A    He worked for Jon Fox.                                        14:20:19

21       Q    And what was his role in this process, if any?                14:20:20

22       A    He -- probably, just an FYI also.                             14:20:24

23       Q    Can we go to Exhibit 227, which is in front of                14:20:32

24  you.                                                                    14:20:41

25       A    This one?                                                     14:20:42
                                                         186



 1       Q    Yes.                                                          14:20:44

 2       A    Yep.                                                          14:20:44

 3                 (Exhibit 227 was marked)                                 14:20:44

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is the actual statement                 14:20:45

 5  of work, correct?                                                       14:20:57

 6       A    That's correct.                                               14:20:58

 7       Q    Now, if you take a look at the first paragraph                14:21:00

 8  of the statement of work, the second sentence says, This                14:21:06

 9  statement of work shall be governed by the master                       14:21:09

10  services agreement effective as of September 28, 2016 as                14:21:12

11  amended the agreement.  Do you see that?                                14:21:16

12       A    Yes.                                                          14:21:19

13       Q    Have you seen a September 28, 2016 master                     14:21:19

14  services agreement?                                                     14:21:24

15       A    I have not.                                                   14:21:27

16       Q    Okay.  Do you know if one exists?                             14:21:28

17       A    I know we have a master services agreement.  I                14:21:32

18  do not know if one exists from that particular date.                    14:21:35

19       Q    Okay.  Do you have any reason to believe that                 14:21:41

20  one exists?  Besides having -- or you haven't seen it,                  14:21:52

21  but do you have any reason to believe there is one that                 14:21:56

22  has this date?                                                          14:21:58

23       A    I don't understand the question.                              14:22:07

24       Q    Right.  So --                                                 14:22:08

25       A    I have no additional information other than                   14:22:09
                                                         187



 1  that to tell me what the actual date is.  I do know we                  14:22:11

 2  have a master services agreement.                                       14:22:16

 3       Q    Got it.  So you're -- but you're not aware of                 14:22:17

 4  one dated September 28th, 2016?                                         14:22:19

 5       A    Not specifically.                                             14:22:21

 6       Q    Okay.  If you go to the bottom of the second                  14:22:22

 7  page of Exhibit 227.                                                    14:22:36

 8       A    Yes.                                                          14:22:38

 9       Q    Under specifications, there is some                           14:22:41

10  language --                                                             14:22:43

11       A    Uh-huh.                                                       14:22:45

12       Q    -- that's bold and all caps.  It says, Legal                  14:22:46

13  needs the business to review and refine the highlighted                 14:22:50

14  language as deemed appropriate to reflect the services.                 14:22:53

15  Do you see that statement?                                              14:22:57

16       A    I do.                                                         14:22:58

17       Q    Do you know what that statement refers to or                  14:22:59

18  means?                                                                  14:23:01

19       A    It just looks like something that wasn't taken                14:23:03

20  out of one of the drafts.  I'm sure someone highlighted                 14:23:05

21  something and said look at this and forgot to erase it                  14:23:09

22  in the end.                                                             14:23:14

23       Q    Who was responsible for actually drafting this                14:23:15

24  document?                                                               14:23:19

25       A    There was several people involved.                            14:23:21
                                                         188



 1       Q    Who were those people?                                        14:23:23

 2       A    Would have been Jon, myself.  I'm sure Ed took                14:23:25

 3  a look at it.  Legal clearly was very engaged.                          14:23:31

 4       Q    Is there a particular person in legal who you                 14:23:38

 5  were working with on this project?                                      14:23:41

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  You can answer that.                         14:23:43

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yes.  Don't tell me the                      14:23:45

 8  substance.  Just do you know their name.                                14:23:48

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  And thank you for taking it                  14:23:50

10  slow whenever you hear things about lawyers and legal.                  14:23:52

11  I appreciate that.                                                      14:23:55

12                 THE WITNESS:  You guys are special.                      14:23:56

13       A    David Winfrey.                                                14:23:58

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And did you work with him                    14:24:03

15  just on this particular project, or did you work with                   14:24:05

16  him on a lot of agreements or -- that you --                            14:24:07

17       A    I don't remember anything beyond this                         14:24:10

18  particular one, actually, for David.                                    14:24:12

19       Q    Okay.  If you look at the first page of                       14:24:14

20  Exhibit 227, the total amounts listed here is                           14:24:21

21  1.5 million, correct?                                                   14:24:25

22       A    Oh, is that the first page?  Yeah.                            14:24:27

23       Q    Yes.                                                          14:24:29

24       A    Yes.                                                          14:24:30

25       Q    The first page.  Actually, going back, was                    14:24:31

 1  there -- you know, with the comments being left in, was                 14:24:33

 2  the process of getting this finished a process where                    14:24:41

 3  there was a rush or something that would have caused the                14:24:47

 4  comments to be left in or it's just a quick process, so                 14:24:49

 5  you didn't have time to -- you or whoever else was                      14:24:53

 6  supposed to review it didn't have time to look at it?                   14:24:57

 7       A    I can't speak to who did the final.  And I did                14:25:01

 8  not sign this.  And so I had input.  I can't -- I have                  14:25:03

 9  no idea.                                                                14:25:08

10       Q    Okay.  And it looks like it was signed by                     14:25:20

11  Kathryn McLay, right?                                                   14:25:22

12       A    Correct.                                                      14:25:25

13       Q    Were you the one who was actually shepherding                 14:25:26

14  it through the process, if that's a good description?                   14:25:28

15       A    I worked with legal and the team to make sure                 14:25:31

16  that legal continued to move through the steps.                         14:25:36

17       Q    So it -- is it reasonable to say that you were                14:25:42

18  kind of shepherding it through, even if you were not the                14:25:46

19  final reviewer or the final signer?                                     14:25:50

20       A    I don't know if shepherding -- I mean,                        14:25:54

21  shepherding is, like, what does that mean?                              14:26:06

22       Q    That's a fair point.  I'll just leave your                    14:26:08

23  description.  You describe what you did.  I -- after I                  14:26:10

24  asked the question, I thought, oh --                                    14:26:13

 1  wearing a robe.                                                         14:26:18

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Were there sheep involved?                   14:26:19

 3       A    Right.                                                        14:26:22

 4       Q    It's fine.  We'll just do with your                           14:26:22

 5  description of what you did.  So going back to the first                14:26:25

 6  page of Exhibit 227, 1.5 million is the total amount                    14:26:29

 7  listed, right?                                                          14:26:31

 8       A    That's correct.                                               14:26:33

 9       Q    Walmart didn't actually pay that full amount,                 14:26:34

10  right?                                                                  14:26:36

11       A    I believe we withheld a payment, the last                     14:26:38

12  payment, due to nondeliverables.                                        14:26:43

13       Q    Okay.  And that -- that was going to be my                    14:26:47

14  next question.  Why -- first of all, were you involved                  14:26:49

15  in the decision to not make the payment?                                14:26:52

16       A    I was made aware.                                             14:26:58

17       Q    Who made you aware?                                           14:27:00

18       A    I don't think it was the person who didn't do                 14:27:03

19  it, but I believe Chris Borrows is the person who told                  14:27:05

20  me.                                                                     14:27:12

21       Q    Okay.  And what did Chris relate to you?  What                14:27:13

22  did he tell you?                                                        14:27:15

23                 MR. SAMMI:  And Chris Borrows is part of                 14:27:16

24  legal or was he --                                                      14:27:19

25                 THE WITNESS:  No.                                        14:27:20

 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  And he --                             14:27:21

 2                 THE WITNESS:  He's ISD.                                  14:27:22

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  You can answer this                   14:27:24

 4  question to the extent your answer doesn't reveal any                   14:27:25

 5  communications that Chris or anybody else might have                    14:27:31

 6  been passing along to you from legal.  Do you understand                14:27:31

 7  that distinction?                                                       14:27:34

 8                 THE WITNESS:  I do.                                      14:27:34

 9       A    So what's your question again?                                14:27:35

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  My question is you                    14:27:36

11  said that Chris Borrows is the one who told you that                    14:27:38

12  payment had been stopped.  And I'm just asking you to                   14:27:43

13  relate that conversation.  What did he say when you had                 14:27:46

14  that conversation with him?                                             14:27:47

15       A    I literally think he just said to me, we're                   14:27:50

16  withholding payment basis not getting the deliverable.                  14:27:53

17       Q    And was there a specific deliverable that he                  14:27:59

18  was referring to?                                                       14:28:01

19       A    That, I do not remember.                                      14:28:02

20       Q    Okay.  And do you know if it was just one                     14:28:03

21  payment that was withheld or two?                                       14:28:08

22       A    I don't know specifically.  The fact that                     14:28:13

23  you're asking makes me wonder.                                          14:28:15

24       Q    Okay.  But you just had this one conversation                 14:28:18

25  with Chris about that?                                                  14:28:21

 1       A    I'm sure I'm -- I'm -- it's -- it's getting                   14:28:24

 2  all tangled --                                                          14:28:32

 3       Q    Okay.                                                         14:28:33

 4       A    -- into what happened at that exact time.                     14:28:33

 5       Q    Sure.                                                         14:28:36

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  And -- and the witness is                    14:28:37

 7  looking over at me and thank you for that because I'll                  14:28:38

 8  just give you a cautionary instruction, based upon your                 14:28:41

 9  feeling, which you're right about.  If it's difficult                   14:28:44

10  for you to separate out what might be thoughts or                       14:28:47

11  impressions or instructions of lawyers at Walmart, I                    14:28:52

12  want you to leave that out of your answers and not                      14:28:55

13  divulge that.  And if you can't separate it in your                     14:28:58

14  answers, I'm going to tell you not to answer the                        14:29:01

15  question but do your best.                                              14:29:03

16       Q    So yeah, obviously, I'm not asking for                        14:29:05

17  communications that you had with lawyers.                               14:29:07

18       A    Correct.                                                      14:29:09

19       Q    Did you have other conversations, not with                    14:29:10

20  lawyers, about this stopping payment and the                            14:29:13

21  deliverables that Walmart felt were not provided?                       14:29:19

22       A    Given the timing of what you're talking about,                14:29:23

23  I really -- I can't separate it.                                        14:29:27

24       Q    Okay.  You can't separate the conversations                   14:29:29

25  that you had with --                                                    14:29:31

 1       A    Because --                                                    14:29:34

 2       Q    -- people from the ones you had with lawyers,                 14:29:34

 3  nonlawyers?                                                             14:29:37

 4       A    No, no, no, no, no, no.                                       14:29:37

 5       Q    Okay.                                                         14:29:40

 6       A    I can't separate what I had with others that                  14:29:40

 7  may have come from lawyers.                                             14:29:45

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Yes.                                         14:29:46

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So just so I can                      14:29:47

10  understand, it sounds like you had a number or you had                  14:29:49

11  some conversations around this time.  I'm not asking for                14:29:53

12  the detail, just you had conversations, it sounds like,                 14:29:56

13  correct?                                                                14:30:00

14       A    Yes.                                                          14:30:00

15       Q    And it sounds like some of those conversations                14:30:01

16  were not with lawyers, correct?                                         14:30:03

17       A    That is correct.                                              14:30:05

18       Q    You're just concerned that maybe those people                 14:30:06

19  were passing information from lawyers to you, right?                    14:30:09

20       A    Correct.                                                      14:30:12

21       Q    And all I want to know is why do you think                    14:30:13

22  that they were passing information from lawyers?  Do you                14:30:15

23  have a sense of why you believe that?                                   14:30:18

24       A    Yes.  So in that -- in the time frame that                    14:30:20

25  you're talking about, that that would have been                         14:30:22

 2  original --                                                             14:30:37

 3       Q    Date of the statement of work.                                14:30:37

 4                 THE WITNESS:  -- complaint?  Original                    14:30:42

 5  complaint.                                                              14:30:42

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Date of the lawsuit was                      14:30:43

 7  August .                                                                14:30:45

 8                 MR. SIMONS:  1st?                                        14:30:45

 9                 THE WITNESS:  Yeah.                                      14:30:45

10                 MR. SAMMI:  -- 1st, 2018.                                14:30:45

11       A    That's why.                                                   14:30:47

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Oh, so it's your                             14:30:49

13  understanding that it was around that time that the                     14:30:53

14  payment was withheld?                                                   14:30:56

15       A    Yes, I believe.  I haven't looked at the                      14:30:57

16  documents, but I believe we were paying in equal                        14:31:00

17  increments through July.  July would have come to an end                14:31:03

18  and August 1st came along.  And I'm pretty sure it got                  14:31:06

19  all tangled into lawyers at that point.                                 14:31:13

20       Q    Did the conversation that you had that with                   14:31:15

21  Chris Borrows happen before August 1st, before the                      14:31:17

22  lawsuit was filed?                                                      14:31:20

23       A    That's where I'm not sure.                                    14:31:21

24       Q    Okay.                                                         14:31:23

25       A    We typically don't pay ahead of time.                         14:31:26

 1       Q    Okay.                                                         14:31:29

 2       A    If that make sense.                                           14:31:29

 3       Q    Is that a policy that you have?                               14:31:31

 4       A    Well --                                                       14:31:32

 5                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          14:31:34

 6       A    I have no idea the policy.  I just know that,                 14:31:35

 7  usually, the work is done and then we pay.                              14:31:37

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Do you have any other insight                14:31:40

 9  into what deliverables were not provided?                               14:31:44

10       A    I don't have the specifics.                                   14:31:51

11       Q    Okay.  Do you know who would have that                        14:31:52

12  information?  Is it Chris Borrows or somebody else?                     14:31:55

13       A    My assumption would be Chris.  I don't know                   14:32:03

14  for sure.                                                               14:32:05

15       Q    What's your understanding of the -- what                      14:32:13

16  happens with a statement of work when the                               14:32:19

17  deliverables -- Walmart feels like the deliverables are                 14:32:26

18  not provide and then Walmart doesn't pay?  What -- where                14:32:31

19  does that leave a statement of work?                                    14:32:34

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  And                        14:32:36

21  objection to the extent it calls for a legal conclusion.                14:32:37

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Once again, not asking for a                 14:32:40

23  legal opinion.  Just asking for your understanding of                   14:32:42

24  where that leaves a statement of work at that point.                    14:32:45

 1  statement of work, whether that's happened before, if                   14:32:50

 2  ever?                                                                   14:32:53

 3                 MR. SIMONS:  Let's talk about this one,                  14:32:54

 4  since it's the one at issue.                                            14:32:56

 5       A    I would have to read this pretty thoroughly to                14:33:00

 6  tell you my opinion on that.                                            14:33:04

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So you don't --                              14:33:06

 8       A    Do you want me to?                                            14:33:08

 9       Q    I guess, what I'm --                                          14:33:08

10                 MR. SAMMI:  I don't want you to interpret                14:33:08

11  a contract.  You're not a lawyer.                                       14:33:09

12       A    Right.  I mean, I just -- yeah.                               14:33:11

13       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So what I'm interested in, do                14:33:13

14  you have an understanding -- separate and apart from                    14:33:16

15  lawyers, do you have an understanding of where that                     14:33:19

16  leaves a statement of work when Walmart doesn't make the                14:33:22

17  payments that are listed under the statement of work?                   14:33:25

18       A    I don't really understand the question.                       14:33:28

19       Q    Have you ever had a situation like this before                14:33:30

20  where there was a statement of work and there was a                     14:33:33

21  certain amount that was supposed to be paid and that                    14:33:35

22  amount was not paid or part of it was not paid?  Have                   14:33:38

23  you had a situation like that before?                                   14:33:41

24       A    I've never had a situation where I did not get                14:33:45

25  a deliverable on an SOW, so I've never had a                            14:33:47

 1  statement -- I mean, a situation where the payment                      14:33:51

 2  wasn't made, that I am aware of.                                        14:33:54

 3       Q    Okay.  Is there something -- in the period                    14:33:56

 4  that -- before this was signed on February 28th, 2018,                  14:34:23

 5  that was the last day of February, there was a                          14:34:31

 6  publication that came out March 1st of 2018, right?  Are                14:34:33

 7  you familiar with that publication?                                     14:34:38

 8       A    Any particular publication?                                   14:34:40

 9       Q    Yes.  The one related to Eden.                                14:34:41

10       A    I am familiar.                                                14:34:44

11       Q    Okay.  You're aware that that came out the day                14:34:45

12  after this was signed, right?                                           14:34:48

13       A    It looks like it.                                             14:34:54

14       Q    Okay.  Were you aware that that publication                   14:34:56

15  was being prepared for release when Exhibit 227 was                     14:34:58

16  being finalized?                                                        14:35:09

17       A    No.                                                           14:35:09

18                  (Exhibit 228 was marked)                                14:35:10

19                 MR. SAMMI:  228?                                         14:35:31

20                 MR. SIMONS:  228.                                        14:35:34

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm showing you an exhibit                14:35:35

23  email from Kathryn McLay to you on February 27th, 2018,                 14:35:41

24  correct?                                                                14:35:45

25       A    Correct.                                                      14:35:46

 1       Q    And it looks like she is attaching the Eden                   14:35:46

 2  blog post that ended up being published on March 1st,                   14:35:50

 3  right?                                                                  14:35:54

 5       Q    So it looks like you were, in fact, aware of                  14:35:56

 6  that blog post that was going to be published before the                14:35:59

 7  statement of work was signed, right?                                    14:36:03

 8       A    One second.                                                   14:36:05

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  Let me object to the form of                 14:36:18

10  the question.  Just for clarity of the record, the                      14:36:19

11  signature dates vary on the statement of work.  And one                 14:36:22

12  is the 26th of February, the other is the 28th of                       14:36:26

13  February.  Just for clarity.                                            14:36:29

14                 Object to the form of the question.                      14:36:32

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And the question is you were                 14:36:34

16  aware that the blog post was being prepared for                         14:36:36

17  publication on the 27th before the final signature on                   14:36:41

18  the statement of work, correct?                                         14:36:46

19       A    Before our final signature or before Zest's                   14:36:54

20  final signature?                                                        14:36:57

21       Q    Before Zest's signature.                                      14:36:59

22       A    Yes.  However, I wouldn't have known that they                14:37:02

23  didn't sign it when I sent it until I got it back.                      14:37:07

24       Q    Well, you knew that it wasn't -- you knew that                14:37:13

25  it wasn't -- you knew you didn't have a signature until                 14:37:16

 1  you received a signature back, right?                                   14:37:19

 2       A    The right.  It could have been a date and they                14:37:22

 3  emailed it to me.  We were done and we sent it to them                  14:37:25

 4  on the 26th.  Or at least I thought it was being sent,                  14:37:29

 5  right, because I knew it was signed by Kath.                            14:37:32

 6       Q    But, in fact, it wasn't sign and returned to                  14:37:35

 7  you until the 28th, right?                                              14:37:37

 8       A    Correct.                                                      14:37:40

 9       Q    And it's dated the 28th on the first page,                    14:37:41

10  right?                                                                  14:37:49

11       A    Correct.                                                      14:37:49

12       Q    Did you put that date in?                                     14:37:50

13       A    No.                                                           14:37:51

14       Q    Do you know who put it in?                                    14:37:53

15       A    I have no idea.                                               14:37:54

16       Q    Were you the last person to see this before it                14:38:16

17  went out the door to Zest asking for a signature?                       14:38:18

18       A    I have no idea.                                               14:38:23

19       Q    Well, let me put it a different way.  You sent                14:38:24

20  it to Zest, right, for signature after Kathryn McLay                    14:38:27

21  signed it?                                                              14:38:31

22       A    I -- I'm -- I don't know.                                     14:38:32

23       Q    Okay.                                                         14:38:34

24       A    If -- I might have.  I really don't know.  It                 14:38:35

25  could have been Ed, it could have been me, it could have                14:38:38

 1  been Kath's assistant.  I have no idea.                                 14:38:42

 2       Q    Did you do any review or editing of the blog                  14:38:45

 3  post listed in Exhibit 228?                                             14:38:49

 4       A    No, no.                                                       14:38:51

 5       Q    Were you involved in providing any information                14:38:55

 6  that was ultimately used in the blog post in                            14:39:01

 7  Exhibit 228?                                                            14:39:07

 8       A    General, like, what does that mean?                           14:39:13

 9       Q    Anything.  I don't know what it might be.  I'm                14:39:15

10  just curious as to whether you provided information,                    14:39:18

11  edited the document, talked to someone who you provided                 14:39:22

12  information to, to be used in this.  Could be a variety                 14:39:26

13  of things.                                                              14:39:29

14       A    Right.  So I'm not sure -- like, I didn't -- I                14:39:30

15  have never seen it until here.  And so what went into                   14:39:35

16  it, you would have to ask who wrote it.                                 14:39:41

17       Q    Did you have a conversation with Mr. Musani                   14:39:46

18  about this blog post?                                                   14:39:49

19       A    I really do not remember any conversations on                 14:39:55

20  the blog post.                                                          14:39:57

21       Q    Okay.                                                         14:39:58

22       A    I frankly remember being surprised by the blog                14:40:01

23  post.                                                                   14:40:05

24       Q    Do you know why it just happens that statement                14:40:05

25  of work was signed on the 28th and then the next day,                   14:40:14

 1  the blog post came out?                                                 14:40:17

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             14:40:20

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  In your view, is it just                     14:40:24

 5  coincidence?                                                            14:40:26

10  time for a break.                                                       14:40:35

18       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just before we went off the                  14:56:49

19  record for a break, I think you said that you were                      14:56:51

20  surprised by the blog post.  Do you recall that?                        14:56:54

21       A    Yes.                                                          14:56:57

23       A    I don't remember getting the information.                     14:57:02

24       Q    But what about it did you find surprising?                    14:57:08

25       A    No -- meaning I just didn't know it was                       14:57:11

 2       Q    Anything about the substance of it that you                   14:57:17

 3  found surprising?                                                       14:57:19

 5       Q    With the statement of work, what was your                     14:57:33

 6  understanding of, kind of, the net relationship between                 14:57:35

 7  Walmart and Zest?  Like, what --                                        14:57:44

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Like, what -- how did you                    14:57:53

10  understand it?                                                          14:57:55

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           14:57:55

12       A    Two questions.  You want something on the                     14:57:55

13  statement of work, or do you want something on the                      14:57:58

14  relationship?                                                           14:58:00

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Well, let's do the                           14:58:00

16  relationship overall.                                                   14:58:03

17       A    Okay.                                                         14:58:04

18       Q    What was your, sort of, net understanding of,                 14:58:04

19  hey, this is what Zest is giving Walmart, this is what                  14:58:06

20  Walmart is giving Zest?  What was your, sort of,                        14:58:09

21  understanding of the net?                                               14:58:12

22       A    I still don't understand the question.                        14:58:14

23       Q    Let me try to put it this way:  When two                      14:58:16

24  parties are in -- have a, you know, business                            14:58:21

25  relationship for a period of time, I'm trying to                        14:58:25

 1  understand, you know, sort of, what did one side think                  14:58:30

 2  they were get and what did the other side -- understand                 14:58:33

 3  they were getting from the other side?  So from                         14:58:36

 4  Walmart's perspective, I understand you were in --                      14:58:39

 5  responsible for the relationship with Zest for a decent                 14:58:42

 6  period of time.  What did you understand, sort of, the                  14:58:46

 7  net arrangement was for Zest?                                           14:58:50

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  We're still                14:58:53

 9  in the individual deposition, right.                                    14:58:55

10                 MR. SIMONS:  Yes, uh-huh.                                14:58:56

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form.  And object                  14:58:58

12  to the extent it calls for any legal conclusion about                   14:58:58

13  the arrangement between the parties that is governed by                 14:59:02

14  contract.                                                               14:59:02

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I'm not asking for a legal                   14:59:04

16  conclusion.  I'm just asking you, like, your                            14:59:08

17  understanding.  What was the arrangement?                               14:59:10

18       A    As referenced to the SOW?                                     14:59:11

19       Q    To the extent that plays into it, yes.                        14:59:14

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objections.                             14:59:18

21       A    Over -- so at this particular time?                           14:59:19

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Sure.  At this -- at that                    14:59:20

23  time.  What was your understanding at that time?                        14:59:22

24       A    Understanding at this time was the statement                  14:59:24

25  of work was the result of the negotiations where Zest                   14:59:26

 1  had requested to, instead of getting a lump sum, to do                  14:59:31

 2  work over a period of time and be paid for it, and so we                14:59:37

 3  had created a situation where we could get services and                 14:59:44

 4  deliverables for that money at their request.                           14:59:51

 5       Q    And looking at the net relationship overall,                  14:59:55

 6  statement of work, as well as, you know, the other part                 15:00:01

 7  of the relationship, what did Walmart expect to get from                15:00:04

 8  Zest in that relationship?                                              15:00:12

 9                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             15:00:16

10       A    I don't think we have any set expectations on                 15:00:17

11  a relationship.                                                         15:00:19

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So you're not aware of                15:00:20

13  anything that Walmart was supposed to get out of that                   15:00:24

14  relationship from Zest?                                                 15:00:27

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             15:00:30

16  Mischaracterizes testimony.                                             15:00:31

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just asking for your                         15:00:32

18  understanding?                                                          15:00:35

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objection.                              15:00:35

20       A    I still am not understanding if I'm speaking                  15:00:37

21  to the statement of work or, like, a phone call.  Like,                 15:00:40

22  what -- I don't understand the definition of                            15:00:43

23  relationship.                                                           15:00:46

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  The whole -- you understand                  15:00:46

25  that there was a period of time where Walmart and Zest                  15:00:48
                                                         205



 1  worked together, right?                                                 15:00:52

 2       A    Correct.                                                      15:00:53

 3       Q    So that's what I mean by the relationship.                    15:00:53

 4  Just the time that you worked together.  Does that make                 15:00:55

 5  sense?                                                                  15:00:59

 6       A    Absolutely.                                                   15:01:00

 7       Q    Okay.  And my question is, over that time, was                15:01:00

 8  there something that you understood Zest was supposed to                15:01:04

 9  provide to Walmart and something that Walmart was                       15:01:08

10  supposed to provide to Zest, if anything?                               15:01:11

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           15:01:14

12       A    The specifics of what we would have expected                  15:01:18

13  would have been in the SOW.  When, you know -- or in an                 15:01:20

14  RFI for the POC, I -- I can't speak to expectations                     15:01:28

15  based on a relationship.                                                15:01:36

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So from -- as far as                  15:01:38

17  you didn't have, I guess, just speaking for yourself                    15:01:41

18  personally, you didn't have any expectations of things                  15:01:44

19  that Zest was supposed to provide to you; is that right?                15:01:47

20       A    Me personally?                                                15:01:50

21       Q    Well, yes.  As a -- you know, you worked at                   15:01:52

22  Walmart.  I know they weren't giving you things, you                    15:01:56

23  know, at your house.  I'm saying --                                     15:01:58

24       A    I expected the deliverables that were in the                  15:02:01

25  statement of work.                                                      15:02:03
                                                         206



 1       Q    And what were those deliverables?                             15:02:04

 2       A    It's a pretty lengthy list.                                   15:02:12

 3       Q    Okay.                                                         15:02:15

 4       A    Do you want me to read them?                                  15:02:16

 5       Q    No, that's fine.  Just whatever's listed                      15:02:17

 6  there, that's what you were looking for?                                15:02:20

 7       A    Absolutely.                                                   15:02:22

 8       Q    And were you the one who was responsible for                  15:02:22

 9  monitoring that and making sure that those deliverables                 15:02:24

10  were provided?                                                          15:02:27

11       A    I was checking on it.  I was not.  Some of it                 15:02:28

12  was technical, and I had Jon Fox involved with the                      15:02:30

13  people who were part of this -- Chris was involved.                     15:02:34

14  There's others involved that would have been able to be                 15:02:39

15  much more capable of understanding if the deliverables                  15:02:41

16  were being met than I.                                                  15:02:45

17       Q    Got it.  And did you understand that Walmart                  15:02:47

18  was going to own any IP related to the statement of                     15:02:50

19  work?                                                                   15:02:53

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, to the                      15:02:55

21  extent it calls for a legal conclusion or interpretation                15:02:56

22  of a legal document from a lay witness.                                 15:02:59

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just asking for your                         15:03:02

24  understanding?                                                          15:03:04

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objection.                              15:03:05

 1       A    In general, my understanding is that we were                  15:03:09

 2  going to be receiving an app or work towards an app.                    15:03:11

 3       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  And did you have an                   15:03:16

 4  understanding of when you didn't finish the payments,                   15:03:19

 5  what the obligations, if any, of Zest were at that time?                15:03:23

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection.  Calls for a legal                15:03:31

 7  interpretation.                                                         15:03:32

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Just your understanding, if                  15:03:34

 9  you have one.                                                           15:03:36

10                 MR. SAMMI:  Same objection.                              15:03:39

11       A    And again, the nondeliverables, the nonpayment                15:03:40

12  and the lawsuit happened all at the same time, and I'm                  15:03:42

13  not comfortable talking about that.                                     15:03:46

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Outside of the context                15:03:52

15  of talking to lawyers, did you have any -- any                          15:03:54

16  conversations with anybody just about what you expected                 15:03:56

17  from Zest?                                                              15:03:58

18                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             15:03:59

19       A    I mean, when we were creating the document, we                15:04:09

20  had discussions on what the deliverables should be.                     15:04:11

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Right.  I mean, after the                    15:04:14

22  nonpayment, did you have any conversation, non -- not                   15:04:16

23  with lawyers or anybody else?                                           15:04:18

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Well, there was lawyers, the                 15:04:20

 1  you cannot separate information that maybe come from                    15:04:26

 2  lawyers or the mental impressions of Walmart's legal                    15:04:30

 3  team inside or outside, I instruct you not to answer the                15:04:34

 4  question.  If, otherwise, you have some sort of                         15:04:37

 5  independent recollection that you can separate out from                 15:04:40

 6  that, you can try to question if you know the answer.                   15:04:42

 7       A    Lawyers got involved very quickly, and I can't                15:04:47

 8  separate.                                                               15:04:49

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So you're not going to                15:04:50

10  answer the question?                                                    15:04:52

11                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.  It's not                 15:04:53

12  -- okay.  Go ahead.                                                     15:04:54

13       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  No.  I just want to                   15:04:55

14  clarify that you're not going to answer the question for                15:04:57

15  that reason; is that right?                                             15:04:59

16       A    For what reason?                                              15:05:01

17       Q    For the reason that you just described, that                  15:05:03

18  -- you're following your lawyer's instructions not to                   15:05:06

19  answer the question; is that correct?                                   15:05:08

20       A    Correct.                                                      15:05:10

21       Q    Okay.  Just wanted to clarify.                                15:05:11

22                 MR. SAMMI:  Thank you.  And -- and for                   15:05:14

23  the record, I'm not -- I just -- just to be clear, I'm                  15:05:16

24  not telling the witness not to answer the question full                 15:05:19

 1  cannot separate in her mind conversations with or                       15:05:27

 2  without lawyers that may reflect legal advice or mental                 15:05:29

 3  impressions of attorneys, that to that extent, she                      15:05:35

 4  should not answer the question.                                         15:05:39

 5                 If she has an independent recollection                   15:05:41

 6  that she can untangle, she could answer the question,                   15:05:41

 7  but the witness has expressed the fact that she cannot                  15:05:46

 8  untangle that, full stop.                                               15:05:50

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Bottom line is you're not                    15:05:53

10  going to answer the question, correct?                                  15:05:54

11       A    Which question?                                               15:05:55

12       Q    The question -- go back to it and here we can                 15:05:57

13  read it.                                                                15:06:01

14                 MR. SAMMI:  I'll give you the same                       15:06:25

15  cautionary instruction that to the extent you have any                  15:06:25

16  independent recollections that you can clearly, in your                 15:06:28

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So -- and that means                  15:06:36

22       A    That is correct.                                              15:06:40

23       Q    Got it.  Were you familiar with any other                     15:06:41

 1       A    I believe that I talked --                                    15:07:00

 2                 THE WITNESS:  If I talked to a lawyer,                   15:07:04

 3  can I talk about this?                                                  15:07:05

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  No.                                          15:07:06

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  No.  I don't want to know                    15:07:08

 7  about conversations with lawyers, but if you were aware                 15:07:09

 8  of the NDA, that's something that is separate from                      15:07:12

 9  whether you had a discussion with the lawyers about it.                 15:07:16

10  So were you aware of the NDA?                                           15:07:20

11       A    Yes.                                                          15:07:22

12       Q    Okay.  When did you become aware of it?                       15:07:22

14       Q    Was it around the time that the lawsuit was                   15:07:34

15  filed?                                                                  15:07:40

17       Q    Okay.  It was prior to that?  Can you give me                 15:07:42

18  a sense of, you know, was it years before the lawsuit                   15:07:48

19  was filed or shortly before?                                            15:07:50

20                 MR. SAMMI:  And to be clear, he's asking                 15:08:00

21  about when --                                                           15:08:02

23                 MR. SAMMI:  -- you may have first learned                15:08:04

24  of the existence of an NDA with Zest.  Not from who you                 15:08:05

25  learned it, what you talked about or what did you didn't                15:08:09

 9       Q    Okay.  And I take it from the conversations                   15:08:25

10  that we have had, that you can't talk about any                         15:08:39

11  discussions related to it because those discussions were                15:08:46

12  with lawyers; is that right?                                            15:08:50

14       Q    Okay.  Did you actually read the NDA when you                 15:08:51

15  became aware of it or -- or not?                                        15:09:02

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  Same class -- same cautionary                15:09:38

 5  instruction.  Whenever Mr. Simons says other than a                     15:09:41

 6  lawyer, I'm telling you that even if it's a nonlawyer,                  15:09:45

 7  if the conversation reflected thoughts of lawyers that                  15:09:46

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So I'm not asking about the                  15:09:54

11  conversation.  I'm asking did you have a conversation                   15:09:57

12  with somebody, a nonlawyer, about it.  And I'm not                      15:09:59

13  asking for the substance, just did the conversation                     15:10:01

14  happen or not.                                                          15:10:05

16  if you recall.                                                          15:10:08

18       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  So you can't recall                   15:10:10

19  having a conversation with a nonlawyer about the NDA; is                15:10:12

20  that accurate?                                                          15:10:16

 4       Q    What agreements?                                              15:10:47

13       Q    So when you say agreement, you're saying it,                  15:11:08

14  sort of, in the general sense that there was an                         15:11:10

15  agreement that that money was going to be reimbursed as                 15:11:12

16  opposed to a written document that documented that                      15:11:15

17  arrangement?                                                            15:11:19

21       Q    Have you ever seen a document that                            15:11:24

22  specifically talks about the reimbursement for the money                15:11:25

23  charged by Deloitte?                                                    15:11:31

24       A    Other than what we've looked at today, like                   15:11:33

 2  agreement related to that?                                              15:11:40

18       Q    Same answer?                                                  15:12:32

19       A    I don't remember.                                             15:12:32

20       Q    Okay.                                                         15:12:33

21                  (Exhibit 229 was marked)                                15:12:35

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Give you what's been marked                  15:12:40

23  Exhibit 229.  And I apologize.  For some reason we                      15:12:41

24  accidentally did not make extra copies of this, so maybe                15:12:45

25  you can kind of share, if that's okay, just this one.  I                15:12:48

 1  feel like you're able to share with your -- especially                  15:12:51

 2  with your own client, so....                                            15:12:55

 3                 And in all fairness, I don't have a copy                 15:12:57

 4  myself, so....                                                          15:13:00

 5                 MR. SAMMI:  Yep.  You can blame this on                  15:13:03

 6  you've been playing this on Jonathan Hart.                              15:13:03

 7                 MR. SIMONS:  Yes.  Let's do that.                        15:13:07

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  The Bates number is                          15:13:09

10       A    Yes.                                                          15:13:17

11       Q    Okay.  Now, this is an email --                               15:13:17

12                 MR. SAMMI:  She doesn't have it yet.  I'm                15:13:20

13  perusing it.                                                            15:13:23

14                 MR. SIMONS:  Okay.  Got it.                              15:13:24

15                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  Look through it.                      15:13:34

16                 THE WITNESS:  Yep.                                       15:13:38

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So the October 13th, 2017                    15:13:39

18  email at the top from you to Mr. Ed Oldham.                             15:13:42

19       A    Yes.                                                          15:13:46

20       Q    It appears to be attaching a May 9th, 2016                    15:13:46

21  statement of work for Deloitte, right?                                  15:13:51

22       A    Correct.                                                      15:13:53

23       Q    This, as I understand it, is the fist Deloitte                15:13:53

24  statement of work.  Is that your understanding as well,                 15:13:58

25  in terms of the ones that you described earlier?                        15:14:01

 1       A    What did I -- what did I say the second was?                  15:14:05

 2       Q    So these are my notes.                                        15:14:08

 3       A    Yep.                                                          15:14:09

 4       Q    Correct me if I'm wrong.  It says the first                   15:14:09

 5  one was about waste in December of '16.  The second was                 15:14:12

 6  speed, spring of 2017.  The third was speed deployment.                 15:14:17

 7  Kind of had an A&B section, in 2018.  And then there was                15:14:22

 8  a Zest one, which you were, sort of, didn't have a                      15:14:26

 9  specific date when I asked you.                                         15:14:29

10       A    That's what this is.                                          15:14:31

11       Q    That was the Zest one.                                        15:14:32

12       A    Yes.                                                          15:14:35

13       Q    Okay.  And the date on that is --                             15:14:35

14       A    2017, but it is not my agreement.                             15:14:37

15       Q    Understood.  This happened before you took                    15:14:39

16  over Zest, right?                                                       15:14:41

17       A    Yes.                                                          15:14:42

18       Q    And I think the date on the actual agreement                  15:14:42

19  is May of 2016.  Feel free to take a look at the                        15:14:45

20  attachment.                                                             15:14:49

21       A    The effective date or the signed date?                        15:15:02

22       Q    I believe it's the signed date but take a look                15:15:05

23  at it.  I apologize.  I don't have a copy.                              15:15:08

24       A    The signed date is September 16th.                            15:15:14

25       Q    Are both of the signatures the same day or is                 15:15:18

 2       A    August 29th.                                                  15:15:22

 3       Q    Okay.  And then what's the effective date?                    15:15:23

 5       Q    Okay.  Now, that attachment, I think it may                   15:15:28

 6  attach a amendment and maybe -- I don't know if you're                  15:15:31

 7  looking at the amendment that was in September.  Can you                15:15:35

 8  take a look at that and see if there's an agreement --                  15:15:39

 9       A    There's a change order, is that correct?                      15:15:42

10       Q    -- and then a change order?                                   15:15:43

11       A    Yes.                                                          15:15:45

12       Q    So the original agreement, do you have --                     15:15:46

13       A    Yes.                                                          15:15:48

14       Q    What date was it signed?                                      15:15:49

15       A    May 5th.                                                      15:15:50

19       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  All right.  So we have a                     15:15:54

20  May 5th, 2016, and then a change order in September,                    15:15:56

21  correct?                                                                15:16:01

23       Q    All right.  And if you look at the first page                 15:16:02

24  of the original agreement, not the change order, it's                   15:16:05

25  got the objectives for the engagement listed on that                    15:16:09

 1  page, right?                                                            15:16:12

 2       A    I'm sorry?                                                    15:16:13

 3       Q    Yeah.  The first page of the primary                          15:16:14

 4  agreement, the attachment to the email.                                 15:16:16

 5       A    Yeah.                                                         15:16:20

 6       Q    Is it -- that listing of objectives consistent                15:16:22

 7  with your understanding of the objectives for the                       15:16:27

 8  agreement?                                                              15:16:29

 9       A    I will not be able to speak to this.  I was                   15:16:30

10  not involved in it.                                                     15:16:33

11       Q    Okay.                                                         15:16:34

12       A    It was before me.  I have absolutely no idea.                 15:16:34

13  I wasn't -- I was literally never engaged.                              15:16:37

14       Q    Okay.  Then if you can then look at Exhibit 2,                15:16:39

15  which I think you have pulled aside there --                            15:16:46

16       A    Uh-huh.                                                       15:16:51

17       Q    -- conveniently.                                              15:16:52

18       A    Yes.                                                          15:16:52

19       Q    Was that presentation --                                      15:16:53

20       A    Was that this one?                                            15:16:54

21       Q    Yes.                                                          15:16:55

22       A    Uh-huh.                                                       15:16:57

23       Q    Was that Exhibit 2 the work product that came                 15:16:58

24  from the statement of work and change order in                          15:17:00

 1       A    I believe, yes.                                               15:17:09

 2       Q    Okay.                                                         15:17:10

 3       A    But I don't know completely.  I was not                       15:17:12

 4  involved in this SOW.                                                   15:17:15

 5       Q    Okay.  And then this one, where she copies.                   15:17:16

 6  Okay.  Show you what's been marked as Exhibit 230.                      15:17:27

 8       A    Yes.                                                          15:17:35

 9       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is another statement of                 15:17:38

10  work.  And I think this one is waste statement of work,                 15:17:40

11  right?                                                                  15:17:43

14       A    Yes.                                                          15:17:46

15       Q    This is one that you were responsible for?                    15:17:49

16       A    I was very engaged.  I did not hire them or                   15:17:51

17  pay them out of my budget, but I was the business                       15:17:54

18  partner.                                                                15:18:05

19       Q    You were the business partner.  And when you                  15:18:05

20  say waste, can you give me a sense of what you mean?  Is                15:18:06

21  that sort of the title that you had for this statement                  15:18:12

22  of work?                                                                15:18:14

23       A    It was all encompassing on root causes of                     15:18:15

24  fresh waste.                                                            15:18:24

25       Q    Did it also include recommendations in terms                  15:18:29

 1  of how to reduce that waste?                                            15:18:32

 2       A    Some.  Some.                                                  15:18:36

 3       Q    What was your general feeling about the work                  15:18:40

 4  that Deloitte did with respect to this particular                       15:18:43

 5  statement of work?                                                      15:18:46

 6                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          15:18:50

 7       A    I felt good.                                                  15:18:53

 8       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Felt good.  Felt like they                   15:18:56

 9  did a good job in identifying the causes of waste?                      15:18:58

10       A    Yes.                                                          15:19:01

11       Q    And did you have any complaints or issues of                  15:19:01

12  problems with what they did?                                            15:19:04

13       A    No, not that I recall.                                        15:19:06

14       Q    Okay.  If you look at the next exhibit, 231.                  15:19:08

15                  (Exhibit 231 was marked)                                15:19:20

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  It's an email from Josh                      15:19:21

17  Mellinger at Deloitte to you in May of 2017; is that                    15:19:25

18  correct?                                                                15:19:29

19       A    That is correct.                                              15:19:29

20       Q    And if you go down, there's an email on                       15:19:30

21  May 5th from you to Josh Mellinger, sort of halfway down                15:19:33

22  the page?                                                               15:19:37

23       A    Yeah.                                                         15:19:38

24       Q    In this first paragraph of that email from                    15:19:38

25  you, you say, I'm thinking about how to structure your                  15:19:41

 1  work.  Our ultimate deliverable here is to be able to                   15:19:45

 2  hand over to the organization a beautiful, fully-baked                  15:19:49

 3  plan, that will, in the excruciating detail, explain how                15:19:52

 4  we scale the pilot.                                                     15:19:57

 5       A    Correct.                                                      15:20:00

 6       Q    Is that related to this waste statement of                    15:20:00

 7  work that we just looked at in Exhibit 230?                             15:20:02

 8       A    No.                                                           15:20:05

 9       Q    Okay.  This is different?                                     15:20:06

10       A    Yes.                                                          15:20:07

11       Q    And which one is Exhibit 231 related to?  Is                  15:20:08

12  that speed?                                                             15:20:13

13       A    Correct.                                                      15:20:14

14       Q    All right.  So the first speed.                               15:20:15

15       A    Yes.                                                          15:20:16

16       Q    Got it.  Okay.                                                15:20:18

17                 And is it accurate to say that the pilot                 15:20:32

18  that you're talking about in Exhibit 231 would have been                15:20:36

19  Gate 2?                                                                 15:20:42

20       A    Oh, no, one.                                                  15:20:46

21       Q    Gate 1?                                                       15:20:50

22       A    Actually, this was zero -- yeah, Gate 1, proof                15:20:50

23  of concept.                                                             15:20:53

24       Q    Gate 1.  Okay.  And you would have considered                 15:20:54

25  it Gate 1 on which initiative?                                          15:21:04

 1       A    Speed.                                                        15:21:07

 2       Q    How does -- I've heard or we've talked about                  15:21:09

 3  with various folks, you know, the Cold Chain project.                   15:21:12

 4  Do you view the Cold Chain project and speed as being                   15:21:17

 5  related?                                                                15:21:21

 6       A    Completely separate.                                          15:21:22

 7       Q    Completely separate.  Okay.  So this is Gate 1                15:21:24

 8  on speed.                                                               15:21:27

 9       A    Correct.                                                      15:21:29

10       Q    And the POC -- or the pilot that is referred                  15:21:32

11  to in Exhibit 231, which pilot is that?                                 15:21:39

12       A    Speed pilot.                                                  15:21:43

13       Q    Okay.                                                         15:21:44

14       A    It the -- as I said before, like, if you get                  15:21:45

15  official, there's a Stage-Gate 1 that should be a proof                 15:21:48

16  of concept.  And then -- and then you go into a pilot.                  15:21:52

17  Those get hairy when you have to work with 4600 stores.                 15:21:57

18  And so, sometimes, a big proof of concept can be                        15:22:01

19  referred to as a pilot.                                                 15:22:06

20       Q    Okay.  And in this particular case, were there                15:22:07

21  outside vendors involved in this particular pilot or was                15:22:12

22  it internal?                                                            15:22:16

23       A    What are you referring to as outside vendors?                 15:22:17

24       Q    What would you think of as an outside vendor?                 15:22:21

25  Maybe a better way for me to ask this is who was                        15:22:26

 1  involved in this -- in this pilot?                                      15:22:30

 2       A    Deloitte.                                                     15:22:32

 3       Q    Deloitte was the only --                                      15:22:32

 4       A    That is correct.                                              15:22:33

 5       Q    Okay.  And what was Deloitte doing in the                     15:22:34

 6  speed pilot?                                                            15:22:39

 7       A    Helping us create a scalability plan as we did                15:22:40

 8  the proof of concept.                                                   15:22:44

 9       Q    Was there anybody else outside of Walmart that                15:22:48

10  was involved in that pilot?                                             15:22:55

11       A    Suppliers.                                                    15:22:57

12       Q    How many?                                                     15:22:58

13       A    Probably, around -- at that point, probably                   15:23:02

14  three.                                                                  15:23:09

15       Q    Do you remember who they were?                                15:23:09

16       A    Naturipe, Driscoll's and probably one other.                  15:23:12

17       Q    And what was the objective?  I mean, speed                    15:23:19

18  suggestions fast, but was there something more detailed                 15:23:24

19  than that that you can --                                               15:23:28

20       A    That is the objective.                                        15:23:29

21       Q    And so I'll try to give you my understanding                  15:23:31

22  and see if it's correct.  And let me know if I'm wrong.                 15:23:34

23  Does that just mean that you're trying to get product                   15:23:37

24  from suppliers through to stores as fast as you could?                  15:23:40

25       A    Yes.                                                          15:23:44

 1       Q    How long did it last?                                         15:23:44

 2       A    The pilot lasted -- the proof of concept                      15:23:46

 3  lasted about four months, but we never dismantled it.                   15:23:51

 4  So it kept running on very small scale, became a pilot                  15:23:58

 5  and then we scaled it.                                                  15:24:04

 6       Q    So has this been implemented now?                             15:24:06

 7       A    Correct.                                                      15:24:09

 8       Q    So it's past Gate --                                          15:24:10

 9       A    Three.  It's past Gate 3.  It's went into Gate                15:24:12

10  4.  We've actually done all of the gates and we've done                 15:24:15

11  a post-audit.                                                           15:24:20

12       Q    Okay.  And is it -- has it been implemented in                15:24:21

13  all distribution centers or --                                          15:24:23

14       A    Good question.                                                15:24:26

15       Q    -- GDCs?                                                      15:24:26

16       A    Yeah.  I can't -- I don't have the capacity in                15:24:29

17  my upstream nodes to get to all GDCs currently.  It has                 15:24:31

18  been implemented to the extent that we have the                         15:24:36

19  capacity.                                                               15:24:40

20       Q    And one more question on this.  Was -- what                   15:24:40

21  was the thing that allowed you to do it faster, if that                 15:24:44

22  makes sense?  I might be asking the wrong question but                  15:24:51

23  maybe you can help me.                                                  15:24:55

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.  You can                    15:24:58

25  answer.                                                                 15:24:59

 1                 THE WITNESS:  Can I?                                     15:25:00

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Yep.                                         15:25:01

 3       A    We took all the inventory out, and we                         15:25:02

 4  increased the frequency of delivery.                                    15:25:05

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Smaller deliveries, more                     15:25:09

 6  frequent, basically?                                                    15:25:11

 7       A    With no inventory.                                            15:25:12

 8       Q    No inventory in --                                            15:25:14

 9       A    Anywhere.                                                     15:25:16

10       Q    GD -- no inventory in the distribution center,                15:25:18

11  no inventory in the store?                                              15:25:20

12       A    There's an odd hand in the store, but no                      15:25:23

13  inventory in the upstream node, no inventory in the                     15:25:25

14  distribution center.                                                    15:25:30

15       Q    And if you don't have any inventory in the                    15:25:30

16  distribution center, what's the point of having the                     15:25:34

17  distribution center?                                                    15:25:37

18       A    It would be very difficult to have trucks                     15:25:38

19  going by themselves with some strawberries to 4600                      15:25:41

20  stores.                                                                 15:25:45

21       Q    Okay.                                                         15:25:46

22       A    It's the door to the store.                                   15:25:46

23       Q    Got it.  So stuff comes -- I guess,                           15:25:47

24  technically, in that scenario, it's in the distribution                 15:25:50

25  center for a very brief period of time, right?                          15:25:52

 1       A    It cross docks, yes.                                          15:25:57

 2       Q    Yeah.  Okay.                                                  15:25:59

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Exhibit 232.  Exhibit 232 is                 15:26:25

 5  an email from you to Greg Smith and Kathy Scott, copying                15:26:43

 6  Ed Oldham in July of 2017, correct?                                     15:26:51

 7       A    Correct.                                                      15:26:56

 8       Q    Relates to another Deloitte statement of work.                15:26:57

 9  Can you tell me which one that this is?                                 15:26:59

10       A    The first speed one.                                          15:27:02

11       Q    Same one that we just were discussing --                      15:27:04

12       A    Uh-huh.                                                       15:27:07

13       Q    -- in Exhibit 231?                                            15:27:07

14       A    Uh-huh.                                                       15:27:10

15       Q    So this is the statement of work for that                     15:27:12

16  particular speed project?                                               15:27:15

17       A    Yes.                                                          15:27:20

18       Q    And it looks like you -- it says here, hi,                    15:27:20

19  Greg.  That Greg is Greg Smith, right?                                  15:27:23

20       A    Correct.                                                      15:27:26

21       Q    Attached is the Deloitte Fresh Flow SOW.  It                  15:27:26

22  is for 2.7 million.  Greg Foran is paying and will need                 15:27:31

23  to sign also, correct?                                                  15:27:35

24       A    Correct.                                                      15:27:37

25       Q    And is that true, did Greg Foran sign this                    15:27:38

 1  statement of work?                                                      15:27:41

 2       A    I'm not sure.                                                 15:27:42

 3       Q    Well, this particular copy is not signed,                     15:27:47

 4  right, because you were sending it up --                                15:27:49

 5       A    Right.                                                        15:27:52

 6       Q    -- up the chain?  Do you know if Greg Foran                   15:27:52

 7  actually signed this --                                                 15:27:55

 8       A    I know that he reviewed it.  I don't know if                  15:27:57

 9  we required his actual signature for that small amount                  15:28:00

10  of money.                                                               15:28:06

11       Q    Okay.                                                         15:28:07

12       A    It was coming from his budget.                                15:28:07

13       Q    Got it.  But from his perspective 2.7 million                 15:28:09

14  would -- would be small.  He's dealing with numbers with                15:28:12

15  B's?                                                                    15:28:16

16       A    He is.  But he's also very particular about                   15:28:17

17  money, so this would be something he would want to be                   15:28:21

18  aware of.                                                               15:28:25

19       Q    What do you mean very particular about money?                 15:28:26

20       A    Yeah.  That's our mission at Walmart, is to be                15:28:29

21  very conscious of money.                                                15:28:34

22       Q    The speed deployment, I think you said it was                 15:28:56

23  in A and B parts in 2018, right?                                        15:28:58

24       A    Yes.  It -- yes.                                              15:29:04

25       Q    And there was a separate statement of work                    15:29:06
                                                         228



 1  with Deloitte for that?                                                 15:29:09

 2       A    Yes.                                                          15:29:11

 3                  (Exhibit 233 was marked)                                15:29:11

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  In Exhibit 233 this is an                    15:29:32

 5  email from Juan Gomez to you and Mike Swatsworth dated                  15:29:42

 6  February 26th, 2018, correct?                                           15:29:47

 7       A    Yes.                                                          15:29:49

 8       Q    Now, does this email and attachment have to do                15:29:52

 9  with one of the Deloitte statements of work?                            15:29:59

10       A    No.                                                           15:30:05

11       Q    Okay.                                                         15:30:06

12       A    None of my Deloitte statements of work.                       15:30:07

13       Q    Fair enough.  It talks about cost to serve.                   15:30:10

14       A    Yes.                                                          15:30:13

15       Q    Do you know what cost to serve means?                         15:30:14

16       A    Yes.                                                          15:30:16

17       Q    What does that mean?                                          15:30:17

18       A    It's a body of work that Juan Gomez leads that                15:30:18

19  is literally just what it says.  What -- how much does                  15:30:23

20  it cost to service the business.                                        15:30:29

21       Q    And maybe if you can just put a little more                   15:30:33

22  color on that.  When you say cost to service the                        15:30:37

23  business, what business is this referring to?                           15:30:40

24       A    So supply chain is a service to our retail                    15:30:43

25  business.  If you don't understand how much your                        15:30:48
                                                         229



 1  services are costing the business, it's very difficult                  15:30:53

 2  to understand your impact, where do you get savings,                    15:30:57

 3  where is there opportunity.  And as I stated before, our                15:31:00

 4  systems historically haven't been very accurate.  And so                15:31:06

 5  this is a large body of work to go after being more                     15:31:10

 6  accurate on costs.                                                      15:31:14

 7       Q    Got it.  So this is the cost of the supply                    15:31:15

 8  chain to provide the supply chain services to Walmart                   15:31:20

 9  overall; is that accurate?                                              15:31:23

10       A    Yes.  And I would -- I -- your definition of                  15:31:26

11  supply chain?                                                           15:31:30

12       Q    It's a great question.  I'm -- I was using                    15:31:35

13  your word, so what would you -- is there a better, more                 15:31:37

14  accurate description than supply chain to refer to the                  15:31:42

15  costs to serve that are at issue in this email?                         15:31:45

16       A    So without getting too complex, often, when a                 15:31:53

17  silo within a business function operates not                            15:31:58

18  holistically, it can make poor business decisions.  Cost                15:32:02

19  to serve really encompassed a fully landed cost across                  15:32:08

20  multiple functions of moving product across the entire                  15:32:13

21  network.  So in our world, some of those things might                   15:32:17

22  not be referred to specifically as supply chain but it                  15:32:21

23  would be moving the product.                                            15:32:25

24       Q    Fair enough.  And did this relate to fresh or                 15:32:26

25  did it relate to a larger part of the business than just                15:32:29

 1  fresh?                                                                  15:32:34

 2       A    So cost to serve is for everything.  I believe                15:32:34

 3  this, as I read it, talks about maybe starting with                     15:32:39

 4  Fresh because it's small.                                               15:32:42

 5       Q    Okay.  And the second -- actually, the third                  15:32:46

 6  paragraph of this email talks about the $450 million                    15:32:49

 7  opportunity to tackle.  Is that Fresh related?                          15:32:53

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          15:32:59

 9       A    Where are you seeing that, sir?                               15:33:01

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  If you look at the                    15:33:03

11  first email at the top of the page?                                     15:33:04

12       A    Yeah.                                                         15:33:07

13       Q    It says Hi, Kelly.                                            15:33:07

14       A    Yeah.                                                         15:33:08

15       Q    If you go to the third paragraph in the last                  15:33:10

16  sentence.                                                               15:33:12

17       A    All of Fresh, correct.                                        15:33:22

18       Q    Okay.  And when you say all of Fresh, is there                15:33:23

19  something specific that you mean by that, as opposed to                 15:33:31

20  some particular part?                                                   15:33:36

21       A    Anything temperature controlled.                              15:33:37

22       Q    Anything temperature controlled?                              15:33:40

23       A    That would be all in Fresh encompassing, so                   15:33:42

24  it's not just produce.                                                  15:33:46

25       Q    That would include meat --                                    15:33:48
                                                         231



 1       A    Meat, yeah.                                                   15:33:50

 2       Q    -- frozen?                                                    15:33:51

 3       A    Dairy.                                                        15:33:52

 4       Q    Dairy?                                                        15:33:52

 5       A    Yeah.                                                         15:33:52

 6       Q    So that's what you mean when you say all of                   15:33:53

 7  Fresh?                                                                  15:33:56

 8       A    Yeah.                                                         15:33:56

 9       Q    And was all of that underneath the umbrella of                15:33:57

10  your organization, all of Fresh as opposed to produce?                  15:34:00

11       A    So I really -- I'm a staff function that has                  15:34:04

12  the ability to influence.  My only direct accountability                15:34:10

13  is that operational piece.  And then I develop                          15:34:15

14  capabilities that are actually executed amongst all the                 15:34:18

15  other functions, so that's a difficult question to                      15:34:23

16  answer.                                                                 15:34:26

17       Q    I think I understand it.  When you say the                    15:34:26

18  operational piece, does the operational piece relate                    15:34:28

19  directly to Fresh produce or no?                                        15:34:33

20       A    It relates to -- no, it does not.                             15:34:36

21       Q    Okay.  When you -- what do you mean by when                   15:34:41

22  you say the operational piece?                                          15:34:43

23       A    So I have physical buildings that I'm                         15:34:45

24  accountable for.  And all of those buildings don't just                 15:34:47

25  deal with only produce.                                                 15:34:51
                                                         232



 1       Q    Got it.  And are the physical buildings that                  15:34:53

 2  you're responsible for the GDCs?                                        15:34:56

 3       A    No.                                                           15:34:59

 4       Q    Okay.  Which physical buildings are they?                     15:35:00

 5       A    I have GCCs, FSCs and import buildings.                       15:35:03

 6       Q    And the GCCs are --                                           15:35:07

 7       A    Grocery Consolidation Center.                                 15:35:11

 8       Q    Uh-huh.  And --                                               15:35:13

 9       A    Fresh Solutions Center.                                       15:35:14

10       Q    Yep.                                                          15:35:16

11       A    And import facilities.                                        15:35:16

12       Q    And the import facilities, are those importing                15:35:18

13  produce from outside the country?                                       15:35:22

14       A    Yes, that's correct.                                          15:35:25

15       Q    And those are the three operational parts of                  15:35:25

16  the business that are under your realm of                               15:35:29

17  responsibility?                                                         15:35:32

18       A    Yes.                                                          15:35:32

19       Q    But the $450 million relates to all of Fresh?                 15:35:39

20       A    Marked down, yes.                                             15:35:42

21       Q    Include of -- including anything temperature                  15:35:44

22  controlled?                                                             15:35:47

23       A    I don't know specifically what time line he's                 15:35:49

24  looking at there, so that's my assumption because it a                  15:35:53

25  big number.                                                             15:35:57
                                                         233



 1       Q    Okay.  Hold -- what is your assumption about                  15:35:58

 2  the time line given the number?                                         15:36:01

 3       A    I don't know.                                                 15:36:04

 4       Q    Okay.                                                         15:36:04

 5       A    So I'm assuming.  I don't know his time line.                 15:36:05

 6       Q    Got it.  Can we go back to Exhibit 216?  See                  15:36:08

 7  how well I organize my pile here.                                       15:36:33

 8       A    I'm going to work really hard in keeping this                 15:36:37

 9  straight here.                                                          15:36:41

10       Q    This is a leadership working group meeting                    15:37:14

11  notice and PowerPoint that we looked at before, correct?                15:37:17

12       A    Correct.                                                      15:37:22

13       Q    One of the things -- if you look at page two                  15:37:26

14  of the attachment, one of the items listed in this                      15:37:28

15  attachment, one, two, three, four, five.  It's not a                    15:37:43

16  bullet point.  There's sort of dashes.  It says,                        15:37:47

17  Deloitte has developed a financial analysis model.  Do                  15:37:50

18  you see that?                                                           15:37:54

19       A    Yes.                                                          15:37:54

20       Q    Are you familiar with the financial analysis                  15:37:55

21  model that Deloitte put together?                                       15:37:57

22       A    Not specifically, no.                                         15:37:59

23       Q    Do you remember it being discussed at any of                  15:38:01

24  the meetings that you attended?                                         15:38:04

25       A    I don't remember.                                             15:38:06

 1       Q    Okay.  Do you remember it being a financial                   15:38:06

 2  analysis model to determine the ROI on implementation of                15:38:15

 3  Zest?                                                                   15:38:19

 4       A    I do not remember specifically.                               15:38:22

 5       Q    At any time in your work with Deloitte, did                   15:38:27

 6  you ever work on a financial model for ROI of                           15:38:33

 7  implementation of Zest?                                                 15:38:39

 8       A    I did not work on that, no.                                   15:38:41

 9       Q    Did you see a model prepared by Deloitte?                     15:38:45

10       A    I do not remember it.                                         15:38:54

11       Q    Okay.                                                         15:38:56

12                  (Exhibit 234 was marked)                                15:39:07

13       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Showing you what's been                      15:39:13

14  marked as Exhibit 234.  It's a November 2016 email chain                15:39:14

15  at the top.  It is an email from Todd Clayton to you and                15:39:33

16  --                                                                      15:39:38

17       A    I'm going to read it real quick.                              15:39:38

18       Q    Oh, yeah, sure.  Go ahead.                                    15:39:40

19       A    Okay.  Thanks.                                                15:40:50

20       Q    Sure.  And the email that I want to focus on                  15:40:51

21  is the second one on the first page.                                    15:40:53

22       A    Yes.                                                          15:40:56

23       Q    It's from you to Todd Clayton, dated Tuesday,                 15:40:56

24  November 22nd, 2016.  Do you see that email?                            15:41:01

25       A    Yeah.                                                         15:41:04

 1       Q    And subject line is Zest deliverables in the                  15:41:04

 2  next five weeks.                                                        15:41:07

 3       A    Uh-huh.                                                       15:41:08

 4       Q    And you say, Thanks, Todd.  I do need                         15:41:09

 5  short-term pricing also, so we can plug into the model.                 15:41:12

 6  See that?                                                               15:41:17

 7       A    Yes.                                                          15:41:18

 8       Q    Do you understand the model to be the                         15:41:18

 9  financeable model that Deloitte put together?                           15:41:20

10       A    No.                                                           15:41:25

11       Q    Okay.  Do you know what model that refers to?                 15:41:26

12       A    In reading this, I would make the assumption                  15:41:30

13  that it means the business case to continue the work.                   15:41:35

14       Q    To continue the work --                                       15:41:39

15       A    On the -- in the deliverables.                                15:41:41

16       Q    Okay.  What models are you aware of that                      15:41:44

17  related to the business case to continue the work?                      15:41:49

18                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             15:41:53

19       A    Say that again.                                               15:41:59

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  You said you thought                  15:42:00

21  this was a model related to the business case for                       15:42:02

22  continuing the work.  And what I'm asking you is what                   15:42:04

23  kind of a model are you aware of that was for the                       15:42:08

24  business case to continue the work?                                     15:42:12

25       A    So as it states in here, I need to provide a                  15:42:14
                                                         236



 1  business case, I think it says, to the SteerCo, which                   15:42:17

 2  would then explain to them how much money we're                         15:42:23

 3  spending, what the value would be, based on the                         15:42:30

 4  activities that we are proposing to do on the                           15:42:34

 5  deliverables.                                                           15:42:36

 6       Q    Got it.  So your understanding is this was                    15:42:38

 7  just about the business case for continuing the work                    15:42:41

 8  with Zest as opposed to the business case or a ROM model                15:42:44

 9  for implementing Zest?                                                  15:42:49

10       A    Which is why I called it short-term pricing.                  15:42:51

11       Q    Okay.  So you say, though, Jeff, I think the                  15:42:56

12  business case will come as long as we know pricing both                 15:42:59

13  short- and long-term.  Do you know what the long-term                   15:43:04

14  pricing was for?                                                        15:43:08

15       A    Well, yeah.  Once -- once you do the                          15:43:10

16  short-term deliverables, if you're going to engage in                   15:43:12

17  something longer than that, you're going to need both.                  15:43:17

18       Q    Do you know if this analysis was actually                     15:43:21

19  completed?                                                              15:43:25

20       A    I don't, which is why I asked the question at                 15:43:27

21  the end.  It may have.                                                  15:43:30

22       Q    The question at the end is which one?                         15:43:32

23       A    When I say both long-term yes, questions mark.                15:43:34

24       Q    Got it.                                                       15:43:35

25       A    I'm kind of asking him.                                       15:43:35

 1       Q    And it looks like he responded and said thanks                15:43:37

 2  -- well, somebody responded.  Todd Clayton responded and                15:43:40

 3  said, Thanks, Kelly.  And we agree.                                     15:43:44

 4       A    Yes.                                                          15:43:46

 5       Q    Did Jeff Kerbs respond, do you know?                          15:43:47

 6       A    I don't know.                                                 15:43:51

 7       Q    If you look back to Exhibit 2, which may --                   15:43:52

 8  may be -- the --                                                        15:43:56

 9       A    The big one.                                                  15:43:58

10       Q    The big one.  And it's off to the side, so                    15:43:59

11  it's easy to find.  If you look at page 45 of Exhibit 2,                15:44:01

12  there is something called a direct impact ROI model.  Do                15:44:05

13  you know if that is the model that's referred to in                     15:44:19

14  either of the exhibits that we've just looked at?                       15:44:23

15       A    I really don't know.                                          15:44:26

16       Q    Okay.                                                         15:44:27

17       A    I -- I don't remember seeing this before I had                15:44:28

18  to produce it for publishing to Zest.                                   15:44:31

19       Q    Oh, for -- when you -- and when you're talking                15:44:36

20  about that, you're talking about when you were looking                  15:44:39

21  at the Deloitte report to create a redacted version to                  15:44:42

22  send to Zest, that's when you remember seeing this on                   15:44:45

23  page 45?                                                                15:44:49

24       A    This big document.                                            15:44:50

25       Q    Okay.  And at that point in time, did you                     15:44:52

 1  specifically look at this, page 45, ROI model?                          15:44:55

 2       A    I looked at this through the lens of what                     15:45:02

 3  should we share or not share.                                           15:45:06

 4       Q    Uh-huh.                                                       15:45:08

 5       A    Not with the lens of looking for a business                   15:45:08

 6  case model.                                                             15:45:12

 7       Q    And what was the guideline that you used in                   15:45:14

 8  terms of thinking about what to share or not share?                     15:45:17

 9       A    Anything that would be considered our data or                 15:45:22

10  information.                                                            15:45:26

11       Q    Anything else?                                                15:45:27

12       A    No, not that I can recall.                                    15:45:28

13       Q    And did you remove anything that you felt like                15:45:35

14  was your data or information?                                           15:45:38

15       A    I think that collectively, several people                     15:45:40

16  suggested removing things.  I don't remember the                        15:45:47

17  specifics of who and what were the removing.                            15:45:49

18       Q    Fair enough.  I guess my question was a little                15:45:52

19  more narrow, which was in terms of what you specifically                15:45:55

20  recommended removing, was that stuff that you thought                   15:45:58

21  was Walmart data?                                                       15:46:03

22       A    Yes.                                                          15:46:05

23       Q    Okay.  And do you remember how --                             15:46:06

24       A    Or information.                                               15:46:08

25       Q    Data or information.  In you mind, what's the                 15:46:10
                                                         239



 1  difference between data or -- and information?                          15:46:14

 2       A    Data can be create -- can create information.                 15:46:17

 3  Data is typically raw.  When you analyze it, multiply                   15:46:20

 4  it, store it, govern it, it can create information.                     15:46:24

 5       Q    Okay.                                                         15:46:27

 6       A    That is my particular definition.                             15:46:28

 7       Q    Understood.  So in your view, information is                  15:46:30

 8  data that has been processed or manipulated in some way?                15:46:32

 9       A    It can also be a process.  It can be -- it can                15:46:37

10  be anything that's -- information is clearly more broad                 15:46:39

11  than data.                                                              15:46:43

12       Q    Okay.  And so the information that -- the data                15:46:44

13  or information that you -- you removed was things that                  15:46:48

14  you considered to be Walmart data or information.                       15:46:52

15       A    Correct.                                                      15:46:56

16       Q    Why didn't you want Zest to have that?                        15:46:56

17       A    Because -- why didn't I want Zest to have                     15:47:10

18  that?  I guess I don't understand the question.  Like --                15:47:15

19       Q    Yeah.                                                         15:47:18

20       A    -- it's our stuff.  I mean, it was prepared                   15:47:18

21  for us.  It was paid for and prevent -- presented to us                 15:47:21

22  as ours.  And so I guess it was -- as it was ours, it                   15:47:26

23  was just an opinion.                                                    15:47:30

24       Q    It was an opinion.  In other words, it was                    15:47:36

25  your opinion or are you talking about --                                15:47:38
                                                         240



 1       A    Yes, absolutely.                                              15:47:40

 2       Q    Okay.  Got it.  And in that -- you felt that                  15:47:41

 3  was true even though the cost of producing this was                     15:47:44

 4  actually paid for by somebody else?                                     15:47:48

 5       A    It was prepared for us.                                       15:47:51

 6       Q    And the fact that someone else paid for it to                 15:47:55

 7  you doesn't change the calculation?                                     15:47:57

 8       A    Calculation --                                                15:48:01

 9       Q    It doesn't change your view about the                         15:48:03

10  information or data?                                                    15:48:06

11       A    It was provided to us as ours.  I would then                  15:48:08

12  protect it as Walmart's information and data.                           15:48:11

13       Q    Okay.  Right.  And, I guess, my question was                  15:48:14

14  just the fact that somebody else paid for it doesn't                    15:48:17

15  change your views on that?                                              15:48:20

17       A    No.                                                           15:48:23

18       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  This actually might be                15:48:31

19  a good time for a break, if that makes sense to                         15:49:02

 5  as Exhibit 235.  At the top is an email from you to                     16:03:49

 6  Scott Neal dated December 1st, 2016, correct?                           16:03:55

 7       A    Yes.                                                          16:03:58

 8       Q    If we go down to the bottom of this email                     16:04:00

 9  chain, the original email is from Lamar Steiger,                        16:04:03

10  correct?                                                                16:04:10

11       A    Yes.                                                          16:04:10

12       Q    How do you know Mr. Steiger?                                  16:04:11

13       A    I had met him one time prior to -- at this                    16:04:15

14  particular time, prior to this.                                         16:04:19

15       Q    And what circumstances did you meet him prior                 16:04:24

16  to this email exchange?                                                 16:04:27

17       A    I think -- I don't know the specifics, but I                  16:04:29

18  think Jeff invited me to a meeting where Mr. Steiger was                16:04:32

19  informing us on things he was doing with meat, maybe.                   16:04:36

20       Q    And who is Mr. Steiger?                                       16:04:42

21       A    I'm -- who is he?  He's a consultant, I                       16:04:45

22  believe.                                                                16:04:49

23       Q    A consultant for Walmart?                                     16:04:52

24       A    Yes.                                                          16:04:54

25       Q    Okay.  And Jeff, you said, introduced you.  Is                16:04:55

 1  that Jeff Thorpe?                                                       16:05:03

 2       A    No.  I believe -- it could have been Jeff                     16:05:04

 3  Thorpe or Jeff Kerbs.                                                   16:05:08

 4       Q    Okay.  One of the two?                                        16:05:09

 5       A    Yes.                                                          16:05:10

 6       Q    Jeff Thorpe is the person on the email at the                 16:05:12

 7  bottom?                                                                 16:05:14

 8       A    Yes.  So it could have been Jeff Thorpe.                      16:05:15

 9       Q    And do you know why you were introduced to                    16:05:18

10  him?                                                                    16:05:21

11       A    I'm going to read the email real quick.                       16:05:31

12       Q    Sure.                                                         16:05:33

13       A    So I don't know why but it looks like the                     16:06:28

14  content of the meeting was applicable to supply chain                   16:06:30

15  and food.                                                               16:06:35

16       Q    Got it.  Now, in the middle of the first page                 16:06:40

17  of this email, it looks like there's an email to -- from                16:06:51

18  Scott Neal to you, saying, Wow, not appropriate.                        16:07:06

19       A    Correct.                                                      16:07:14

20       Q    Do you have an understanding of what that                     16:07:15

21  means?                                                                  16:07:17

22       A    I cannot interpret Scott's intentions there.                  16:07:21

23       Q    Uh-huh.                                                       16:07:26

24       A    But he was referring to the email, so....                     16:07:27

25       Q    Why did you send this to Scott Neal?                          16:07:30
                                                         243



 1       A    Because he is SEP of meat.                                    16:07:33

 2       Q    Okay.  And was your understanding that this                   16:07:37

 3  was forwarded onto Mr. Foran?                                           16:07:43

 4       A    Mr. Foran is in the email.                                    16:07:50

 5       Q    Right.                                                        16:07:53

 6       A    It wasn't forwarded to him.  It was written to                16:07:55

 7  him.                                                                    16:07:57

 8       Q    It was sent to him?                                           16:07:58

 9       A    Yes.                                                          16:07:59

10       Q    So you were unhappy about the fact that it was                16:08:00

11  sent to Greg Foran, correct?                                            16:08:04

12       A    No.                                                           16:08:09

13       Q    You weren't?                                                  16:08:10

14       A    I was unhappy that he wrote the email.                        16:08:11

15       Q    Okay.  Why were you unhappy that he wrote the                 16:08:14

16  email?                                                                  16:08:17

17       A    My personal opinion is he didn't have -- he                   16:08:20

18  spent a half an hour with me, and then wrote an email                   16:08:23

19  judging the work that Jeff and I were doing without                     16:08:27

20  details.                                                                16:08:30

21       Q    Got it.  And what, specifically, in your -- in                16:08:32

22  his email did you consider judging the work that you                    16:08:35

23  were doing?                                                             16:08:39

24       A    When he inferred that we were moving slow and                 16:08:48

25  we would miss another growing season.  How sad.                         16:08:54
                                                         244



 1       Q    So that's the fourth paragraph in his email?                  16:09:00

 2       A    Correct.                                                      16:09:05

 3       Q    Where he says, Speed is the only competitive                  16:09:06

 4  advantage?                                                              16:09:10

 5       A    Correct.                                                      16:09:10

 6       Q    Excuse me.  And he says, While Walmart                        16:09:11

 7  continued to request studies and data, it'll also                       16:09:14

 8  continue to throw away very large amounts, dash, dash,                  16:09:17

 9  dash, very large amounts of food and will probably miss                 16:09:23

10  another growing season.  Wow, how sad.                                  16:09:26

11                 That's what -- the part that made you                    16:09:31

12  angry?                                                                  16:09:33

13       A    Yes.                                                          16:09:33

14       Q    You felt like he was criticizing you and                      16:09:34

15  saying you were slow?                                                   16:09:36

16       A    I think he was making judgments with very                     16:09:38

17  little information.                                                     16:09:41

18       Q    Did you respond to him and let him know?                      16:09:42

19       A    I did not because I thought Jeff did a great                  16:09:47

20  job of responding to him.                                               16:09:50

21       Q    At the top of this email on the first page,                   16:09:54

22  you say, Made me so angry, I couldn't see.                              16:09:57

23       A    Yes.                                                          16:10:02

24       Q    Is that an accurate description of how you                    16:10:03

25  felt at the time.                                                       16:10:08

 1       A    I was -- well, and the date.  You know, I                     16:10:08

 2  wasn't even a year into the company.  So when someone                   16:10:11

 3  would judge my work with 30 minutes of general                          16:10:17

 4  information and copy leadership, it made me very angry.                 16:10:21

 5       Q    Was this the first time that Lamar Steiger had                16:10:28

 6  made you so angry that you couldn't see?                                16:10:31

 7       A    I only had met him one time for 30 minutes.                   16:10:34

 8       Q    Okay.  Did he do anything in the future other                 16:10:37

 9  times that had this similar -- made you angry like this                 16:10:41

10  particular one did?                                                     16:10:44

11       A    I have never interacted with him on a very                    16:10:46

12  specific business.  I, since, have been on a plane with                 16:10:51

13  him going to store visits.  And I've seen him out in                    16:10:55

14  Bentonville.  But I've never been in a business                         16:10:59

15  interaction with him after this.                                        16:11:02

16       Q    Okay.  And when you say you were on a plane                   16:11:04

17  with him, was that a private plane where you were --                    16:11:06

18       A    It was a Walmart store visit.                                 16:11:09

19       Q    Okay.  And are those visits that Greg Foran                   16:11:11

20  does from time to time?                                                 16:11:15

21       A    All of the executives do them.                                16:11:15

22       Q    Okay.  That particular one was Greg Foran                     16:11:17

23  doing the visit?                                                        16:11:20

24       A    Yes.                                                          16:11:22

25       Q    Okay.  And did you have a conversation with                   16:11:22

 1  Mr. Steiger during that?                                                16:11:24

 2       A    Casual.                                                       16:11:28

 3       Q    Was it friendly?                                              16:11:28

 4       A    Oh, yeah.                                                     16:11:29

 5       Q    Did you --                                                    16:11:30

 6       A    It had been, what, two years.                                 16:11:32

 7       Q    Got it.  So that was in 2018, late in 2018?                   16:11:35

 8       A    I actually think it was -- might have been                    16:11:39

 9  2019, early 2019.  It was just more recently.                           16:11:42

10       Q    Recent?                                                       16:11:48

11       A    Yeah.                                                         16:11:49

12       Q    Did you talk to Mr. Steiger at all about this                 16:11:49

13  exchange since that time?                                               16:11:51

14       A    I have never talked to him about this                         16:11:54

15  exchange.                                                               16:11:56

16       Q    If you look at the first page, still the email                16:11:58

17  at the top, you say in your email, I'm still new here                   16:12:00

18  and getting trashed in an email to the CEO that doesn't                 16:12:04

19  really know me.  That was great convo for the                           16:12:08

20  Thanksgiving table but not a great career builder.                      16:12:11

21                 Do you see that?                                         16:12:15

22       A    Yes.                                                          16:12:15

23       Q    Is -- did you talk to anyone else about this?                 16:12:16

24  Did you have this convo at the dinner table?                            16:12:20

25       A    It was funny.  Pretty interesting.                            16:12:23

 1                 My -- my dinner table.  I mean, you know,                16:12:25

 2  in general, Greg and Lamar have a very long                             16:12:32

 3  relationship, so I'm sure I'm referring to that.                        16:12:39

 4       Q    Got it.  So you were referring to the                         16:12:45

 5  conversation that maybe Greg and Mr. Steiger were having                16:12:48

 6  at their dinner table, not conversation you had at                      16:12:52

 7  yours?                                                                  16:12:56

 8       A    Yeah.  Yeah.  I was trying to forget it                       16:12:56

 9  frankly.                                                                16:12:58

10       Q    Why were you trying to forget it?                             16:12:59

11       A    Because, as I stated, this man had 30 minutes                 16:13:01

12  of general information and then chose to judge my work                  16:13:03

13  and copy the CEO.                                                       16:13:09

14       Q    Did you experience any negative consequences                  16:13:12

15  from this email and the fact that Mr. Foran was copied                  16:13:16

16  on it?                                                                  16:13:24

17       A    Not that I'm aware of.                                        16:13:24

18       Q    Did you have any conversations with Mr. Foran                 16:13:26

19  about this email?                                                       16:13:29

20       A    No.                                                           16:13:30

21       Q    Did you have any conversations with anybody                   16:13:30

22  else besides the folks in this email, Jeff Thorpe and                   16:13:32

23  Scott Neal, about this email?                                           16:13:36

24       A    I may have talked to Kath about it, but I                     16:13:37

25  don't know.                                                             16:13:42

16       A    At this time, I really don't know.  She was                   16:14:20

17  the senior director, though, in flow.  She was a peer of                16:14:22

18  mine.                                                                   16:14:26

 1       Q    Is that your -- is that how you usually refer                 16:14:44

 2  to him is the meat man?                                                 16:14:46

 3       A    He was the guy that is working with meat.                     16:14:49

 4  He's the consultant.  He's the meat consultant.                         16:14:51

 5       Q    Got it.  And this is the note he sent to Greg,                16:14:55

 6  right?                                                                  16:14:58

 8       Q    Then you say, He is just going to fire me.                    16:15:00

 9  That he that you're referring to is Greg Foran, right?                  16:15:05

10       A    I -- I don't know who I was referring to.  It                 16:15:12

11  could have been just, like, this man is going to cause                  16:15:14

12  me to be fired.  I don't know.                                          16:15:17

13       Q    Okay.  So could mean you're saying Mr. Steiger                16:15:19

14  is going to --                                                          16:15:21

18       Q    Or it could mean Greg Foran is going to fire                  16:15:28

19  you.  One of the two?                                                   16:15:30

20       A    Could.                                                        16:15:33

21       Q    And it says, This makes me so sad.  Why did it                16:15:34

23       A    I told you.                                                   16:15:39

24       Q    Did you -- at this time, were you concerned                   16:15:40

25  that this was going to happen, that you were going to                   16:15:42

 2       A    This is probably -- is this -- when is this?                  16:15:45

 3  When was the date?                                                      16:15:48

 4       Q    November of 2016.                                             16:15:49

 5       A    Yeah.  So it's the same day.  I'm very sad.  I                16:15:50

 6  don't know.  I mean, this guy is -- has a relationship                  16:15:53

 7  with the CEO.  And in my opinion, with very little                      16:15:57

 8  information, judged my work incredibly inappropriately,                 16:16:04

 9  which was agreed to by an SVP.                                          16:16:08

10       Q    The SVP being?                                                16:16:13

11       A    Scott Neal.                                                   16:16:16

12       Q    Scott Neal.                                                   16:16:17

13                  (Exhibit 237 was marked)                                16:16:24

14       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  In Exhibit 237, which is                     16:16:24

15  another, I guess an email between you and Brian Waters                  16:16:44

16  and a variety of other people, correct?                                 16:16:58

17       A    Yes, yes.                                                     16:16:59

18       Q    This is January 4th, 2017, right?                             16:17:01

19       A    Correct.                                                      16:17:05

20       Q    It says, Guys, here's what I'm thinking for                   16:17:06

21  content for Greg as we start preparing for the                          16:17:09

22  1/20 meeting.                                                           16:17:15

23                 Is the Greg referred to here Greg Foran                  16:17:16

24  or Greg Smith, do you know?                                             16:17:19

25       A    Hold on one second.                                           16:17:22
                                                         251



 1       Q    Sure.                                                         16:17:24

 2       A    Foran.                                                        16:17:52

 3       Q    And how do you know it's got Greg Foran?                      16:17:53

 4       A    Because of the timing and the content of what                 16:17:56

 5  is being asked for and the amount of time that the                      16:18:02

 6  meeting is.                                                             16:18:05

 7       Q    The amount of time?  Where do you see the                     16:18:10

 8  amount of time that the meeting is?                                     16:18:14

 9       A    This may take us too much time and be out of                  16:18:16

10  spoke right there.  And it also says that we have an                    16:18:19

11  hour.                                                                   16:18:23

12       Q    Okay.  Okay.  I know that we already talked                   16:18:24

13  about the Legacy steering committee meetings that you                   16:18:27

14  attended and presented at.  Did you have other meetings                 16:18:31

15  with Mr. Foran besides the Legacy meetings?                             16:18:35

16       A    This was an extension of a Legacy meeting.                    16:18:38

17  Greg, in a Legacy meeting, requested additional                         16:18:42

18  information that would have taken too long in the Legacy                16:18:47

19  meeting, so it was a break-out basically.                               16:18:50

20       Q    Did it happen just immediately after the                      16:18:52

21  meeting?                                                                16:18:56

22       A    No, no.  He doesn't have that kind of                         16:18:56

23  flexibility in his schedule, so it was scheduled later.                 16:18:58

24       Q    Is there a particular reason why -- well, let                 16:19:04

25  me ask this.  Was that a common thing, where something                  16:19:09
                                                         252



 1  would happen in a Legacy meeting, and then there would                  16:19:13

 2  be another break-out meeting after that to discuss?                     16:19:15

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to form.                              16:19:19

 4       A    I'm never in a legacy meeting except for when                 16:19:20

 5  I'm presenting.                                                         16:19:23

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So in the ones that you                      16:19:24

 7  attended, did that happen any other time?                               16:19:26

 8       A    One other time that I'm aware of.                             16:19:29

 9       Q    And what was the subject of the break-out if                  16:19:31

10  this particular incident?                                               16:19:33

11       A    The operational strategy.                                     16:19:35

12       Q    Operational strategy for Fresh Flow?                          16:19:37

13       A    For the upstream nodes of Fresh.  So my -- my                 16:19:39

14  operations arm that I talked about.                                     16:19:45

15       Q    Uh-huh.                                                       16:19:48

16       A    Where are we going with that.                                 16:19:48

17       Q    Got it.  Was there a specific focus related to                16:19:51

18  where you were going with that or just generally                        16:19:55

19  speaking, what was the strategy for that?                               16:19:57

20       A    So it was having an upstream node is a                        16:20:00

21  requirement for the speed network.  Mr. Foran was very                  16:20:04

22  interested in understanding the specifics of all of the                 16:20:10

23  upstream nodes.  And what their -- the intents for use                  16:20:13

24  was.                                                                    16:20:17

25       Q    The other time that there was a break-out,                    16:20:18
                                                         253



 1  what was the topic of discussion?  A break-out after the                16:20:27

 2  Legacy meeting.                                                         16:20:31

 3       A    This is kind of funny but exactly the same                    16:20:32

 4  thing.                                                                  16:20:35

 5       Q    Okay.                                                         16:20:35

 6       A    So about nine months later, they started                      16:20:35

 7  asking questions.  Both Gregs were like, I don't                        16:20:38

 8  understand what -- and so they requested an -- another                  16:20:43

 9  break-out, and I re-provided basically the same                         16:20:47

10  information about five minutes.  And they are like, oh,                 16:20:53

11  we just did this.  So they had just forgotten.  But it                  16:20:56

12  was literally almost the same information.                              16:20:59

13       Q    Had anything changed between the two?  I                      16:21:05

14  guess, if it was the same information, nine months, it                  16:21:07

15  must have been --                                                       16:21:10

16       A    Very little.  I mean, there was -- there was,                 16:21:11

17  I'm sure, some additional information we had learned                    16:21:13

18  that we would share but, in general, the strategy has                   16:21:15

19  been pretty consistent.                                                 16:21:19

20       Q    Other than the Legacy meetings where you                      16:21:27

21  presented and these two break-out sessions that followed                16:21:29

22  on from Legacy meetings, have you had any other meetings                16:21:33

23  with Mr. Foran?                                                         16:21:37

24       A    I have not had any other meetings.  I've been                 16:21:42

25  in a small group that he's presented to.  These were                    16:21:46
                                                         254



 1  really break-outs from the Legacy meeting.  I can't                     16:21:54

 2  recall any other meetings that I would be in.                           16:21:58

 3       Q    In this -- the small group meetings that you                  16:22:01

 4  attended, what was the subject of those meetings?                       16:22:04

 5       A    It was just a small group invite for him to                   16:22:08

 6  come and share his perspectives on leadership.                          16:22:13

 7       Q    Anything to do with Fresh Flow?                               16:22:20

 8       A    No.                                                           16:22:23

 9       Q    Anything to do with Zest?                                     16:22:24

10       A    No.                                                           16:22:25

11       Q    How many people attended those sessions,                      16:22:27

12  approximately?                                                          16:22:29

13       A    On the phone, I believe there were over 20.                   16:22:32

14  And I think in the room there were maybe 20, 30.                        16:22:35

15                 (Exhibit 238 was marked)                                 16:22:39

16       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I'm giving you what's been                   16:22:56

17  marked as Exhibit 238.                                                  16:23:00

18                 Exhibit 238 is an email exchange between                 16:23:21

19  Mr. Foran and Peter Mehring on March 26th that starts                   16:23:24

20  with that, if you go to the second page, correct?                       16:23:34

21       A    Yes.                                                          16:23:39

22       Q    And then there's a response from Mr. Foran on                 16:23:43

23  the bottom of the first page or, really, the middle of                  16:23:49

24  the first page, I guess, is the way to describe it.  Do                 16:23:53

25  you see that, on Wednesday, March 22nd?                                 16:23:57

 6  dollar.                                                                 16:24:11

 7                 Mr. Foran says, We are so risk averse in                 16:24:12

 8  the Fresh Food area.  I can't understand why, but                       16:24:15

 9  possibly, it reflects a lack of talent and skill.  Do                   16:24:18

10  you see that?                                                           16:24:21

11       A    Yes.                                                          16:24:22

12       Q    And then he says, Between this and some                       16:24:22

13  discussions on meat, it's apparent that we lack                         16:24:24

14  intestinal fortitude.  Do you see that as well?                         16:24:28

15       A    Yes.                                                          16:24:31

16       Q    And then he says, Assume Kelly is involved and                16:24:31

17  not supportive.  Do you understand the Kelly he's                       16:24:36

18  referring to is you?                                                    16:24:39

21       A    It says Kelly Boyle.                                          16:24:43

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Assumes Kelly Boyle is                       16:24:45

23  involved, so it's pretty clear that it's you, correct?                  16:24:48

24       A    Yes.                                                          16:24:51

 2  what you were doing and felt like you were not                          16:25:02

 3  supportive of Zest.  Is that --                                         16:25:05

 6       A    It does not say that.                                         16:25:11

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  How do you read it?                   16:25:14

11       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You can go ahead.                            16:25:21

12       A    Assuming is a thought.  It's not a fact.                      16:25:23

13       Q    Understood.  I understand that he was assuming                16:25:27

14  that.                                                                   16:25:29

15       A    And it's a question, which means he doesn't                   16:25:35

16  know.                                                                   16:25:37

17       Q    Got it.  Did you follow up with either Peter                  16:25:37

22       A    First time I've seen it.                                      16:25:51

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did you have a conversation                  16:25:52

24  with Mr. Foran in the March 2017 time frame?                            16:25:53

25       A    Not that I'm recalling.                                       16:26:01

 1       Q    Were you supportive at this point in time?                    16:26:04

 2       A    Of what?                                                      16:26:07

 3       Q    Of Zest.                                                      16:26:08

 4       A    I don't know what supportive means.                           16:26:12

 5       Q    What do you understand supportive to mean?  I                 16:26:17

 6  mean, what's your -- if you're supportive of something,                 16:26:21

 7  how do you understand that?                                             16:26:24

 8       A    We were working with Zest.  I believe, at this                16:26:27

 9  time, I probably had -- is this the right timing?  Am I                 16:26:32

10  getting Zest now?  I think this is around the right                     16:26:42

11  timing.  I'm not sure.                                                  16:26:45

12                 And from a supportive standpoint, that's                 16:26:47

13  just too broad.  Like, I'm working on Fresh.  They are                  16:26:51

14  one of the vendors.  I'm working on all kinds of stuff.                 16:26:54

15  My big project is speed, so that's where most of --                     16:26:58

16  during this time, most of my energy is going towards the                16:27:03

17  pilot that's coming up.  So I -- I don't know where he                  16:27:07

18  got that assumption.                                                    16:27:10

19       Q    In terms of do you agree with him that it                     16:27:12

20  could reflect a lack of talent and skill?                               16:27:17

21                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.                 16:27:20

22       A    I have absolutely no idea.                                    16:27:22

23       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Do you agree with his                        16:27:25

24  statement that it might be that you lack intestinal                     16:27:26

25  fortitude?                                                              16:27:30

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Well, between this and some                  16:27:33

 7       A    Mr. Steiger was working on meat.  He talked to                16:27:40

 8  me about it.                                                            16:27:44

 9       Q    Okay.  And he says, It's also apparent we lack                16:27:45

10  intestinal fortitude.                                                   16:27:50

11                 Would you agree with that statement?                     16:27:53

12                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.                 16:27:55

20  understand what Walmart has fortitude for.  I'm probably                16:28:13

21  not qualified to judge that.                                            16:28:18

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And he specifically talks                    16:28:20

23  about you here.  Is he saying that you lack intestinal                  16:28:22

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  The bottom line is you                16:28:34

 9       A    Well, you told me the it was referring to                     16:28:49

10  Walmart, and I'm part of Walmart.                                       16:28:53

11                 MR. SAMMI:  I'm sorry.  Just to be clear,                16:28:55

12  if he tells you something --                                            16:28:56

14                 MR. SAMMI:  -- that doesn't mean it's so.                16:28:58

 4  gave me the Caribiner Award.                                            16:29:29

 6       A    Legacy or Camp for Greg's -- Foran gives an                   16:29:36

 8  town hall, but I don't -- it might have been a little                   16:29:50

 9  bit after this.  It was after this, but I don't know                    16:29:54

10  when.                                                                   16:29:59

11       Q    And what was that for specifically?                           16:30:00

12       A    My projects.                                                  16:30:01

13       Q    And which --                                                  16:30:02

14       A    My work in Fresh Flow.                                        16:30:03

15       Q    And you don't remember the timing of that?                    16:30:04

16       A    I think it was Camp Four, so it might have                    16:30:07

17  been after this.                                                        16:30:10

18       Q    When you say Camp Four, what's Camp Four?                     16:30:11

19       A    It's the new name for Legacy.                                 16:30:15

20       Q    So the Legacy steering committee is now                       16:30:16

21  calling Camp Four?                                                      16:30:19

22       A    Correct.                                                      16:30:21

23       Q    And do you recall when that name change                       16:30:21

24  occurred?                                                               16:30:23

25       A    I want to say two years ago.  That's a guess.                 16:30:27

 1       Q    And did the functioning of that organization                  16:30:33

 2  or that committee change at all or is it just the name?                 16:30:36

 3       A    Just the name.                                                16:30:40

 4       Q    Do you know why it's called Camp Four?                        16:30:40

 5       A    It was the next phase of his leadership, and                  16:30:43

 6  he titles them differently.                                             16:30:46

 7       Q    Got it.  So camp as in moving up the mountain?                16:30:48

 8       A    Camp Four is the last camp before you ascend                  16:30:53

 9  to the top of Mount Everest.                                            16:30:57

10       Q    Oh.                                                           16:30:59

11                  (Exhibit 239 was marked)                                16:31:15

12       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I have what's been marked now                16:31:22

13  as Exhibit 239.  This is an email between you and                       16:31:24

14  Kathryn McLay, correct?                                                 16:31:35

15       A    Correct.                                                      16:31:37

16       Q    If we look at the third page, at the top, the                 16:31:46

17  date is May 25th of 2017, right?                                        16:31:49

18       A    Correct.                                                      16:31:53

19       Q    And then if we go back to the third page, it                  16:31:54

20  looks like it's still the same day, just earlier in the                 16:32:01

21  day, right?                                                             16:32:05

22       A    Yep.                                                          16:32:09

23       Q    And on this third page, Bates label M00012880,                16:32:09

24  there's an email in the middle of the page where you                    16:32:17

25  write that you met with Zest and Zest -- I guess you                    16:32:20
                                                         262



 1  told Zest don't run to Greg and say that we are slow and                16:32:30

 2  dumb again.  Do you see that?                                           16:32:34

 3       A    I let them know -- it does not say that I said                16:32:41

 4  that to them.  I let them know, so that's probably a                    16:32:44

 5  summation of my communication.                                          16:32:48

 6       Q    Okay.  So that may not be a direct quote but                  16:32:50

 7  that was the gist of what you were saying to Zest?                      16:32:53

 8       A    Correct.                                                      16:32:56

 9       Q    And who told Greg that you were slow and dumb?                16:32:58

10       A    Again, that's a summation of general                          16:33:12

11  conversations around Zest's perspective of the work.                    16:33:14

12       Q    So you're -- are you saying that no one                       16:33:22

13  actually said you were slow and dumb?  That was just,                   16:33:26

14  sort of, the gist?                                                      16:33:30

15       A    Yes.                                                          16:33:32

16       Q    The gist of what people were saying to                        16:33:34

17  Mr. Foran?                                                              16:33:36

18       A    The conversation around the communication                     16:33:38

19  between Zest and Walmart.                                               16:33:40

20       Q    Between Zest and Walmart or between Zest and                  16:33:47

21  Mr. Foran?                                                              16:33:50

22       A    This says it's Zest and Greg but, in general,                 16:33:50

23  yes.                                                                    16:33:54

24       Q    Okay.  But here, you were specifically                        16:33:54

25  concerned about them going to Greg --                                   16:33:56
                                                         263



 1       A    Yes.                                                          16:33:58

 2       Q    -- and saying something negative about you.                   16:34:00

 3       A    We, not me.                                                   16:34:02

 4       Q    Okay.  We.  And "we" in this particular case                  16:34:03

 5  is who?                                                                 16:34:07

 6       A    The broader sense of Fresh.                                   16:34:09

 7       Q    Are you aware of any conversation that took                   16:34:20

 8  place between someone at Zest and Mr. Foran where                       16:34:22

 9  someone said Fresh was slow and dumb?                                   16:34:26

10       A    Slow would have been the Lamar email.  Dumb                   16:34:32

11  was word of mouth.  And I have never seen a                             16:34:38

12  communication until you just showed it to me in                         16:34:42

13  reference to lack of talent and Walmart.                                16:34:45

14       Q    Now, that was Mr. Foran's words, right, not                   16:34:50

15  somebody at Zest?                                                       16:34:54

16       A    That is correct.                                              16:35:03

17       Q    So that wouldn't have been Zest going to                      16:35:04

18  Mr. Foran and saying you were dumb, right?  That was an                 16:35:07

19  email from Mr. Foran?                                                   16:35:16

20       A    That is correct.                                              16:35:18

21       Q    Okay.  Did it make you angry that Zest had                    16:35:19

22  this direct relationship with Mr. Foran?                                16:35:22

23       A    No.                                                           16:35:25

24       Q    Did it bother you?                                            16:35:27

25       A    It sometimes made things more difficult.                      16:35:29

 1       Q    Okay.  So it did bother you?                                  16:35:32

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             16:35:36

 4       A    A lot of things at work are difficult.  They                  16:35:39

 5  don't bother me.                                                        16:35:43

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Nothing bothers you?                         16:35:45

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection.  Mischaracterizes                 16:35:49

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Let me put it this way.  The                 16:35:52

11  communication -- for example, Mr. Steiger's                             16:35:54

12  communication made you so angry, you couldn't see,                      16:35:56

13  right?                                                                  16:35:59

14       A    Correct.                                                      16:35:59

15       Q    So -- and that communication was also about                   16:36:00

16  Zest, right?                                                            16:36:02

17       A    That communication made me angry because it                   16:36:03

18  was a personal attack.                                                  16:36:06

19       Q    And was it all --                                             16:36:12

20       A    Based on --                                                   16:36:17

21       Q    I'm sorry.  Go ahead.                                         16:36:19

22       A    Based on very little information.                             16:36:21

23       Q    Did it also make you angry because it was sent                16:36:23

24  to Mr. Foran?                                                           16:36:26

 1       Q    Fair enough.  So somebody -- a personal attack                16:36:30

 2  by somebody to leadership at Walmart about you is                       16:36:32

 3  something that would have made you angry?                               16:36:36

 4       A    Yes.                                                          16:36:39

 5       Q    Okay.                                                         16:36:40

 6       A    Unfounded, correct.                                           16:36:42

 7       Q    The fact that Mr. Steiger made that statement                 16:36:53

 8  and made you angry, did you associate him with Zest                     16:36:55

 9  given that he was advocating for Zest in that same                      16:36:58

10  email?                                                                  16:37:01

11       A    I was not aware of any direct relationship.                   16:37:04

12       Q    Well, he certainly talks about Zest in his                    16:37:08

13  email that made you angry, right?                                       16:37:11

14       A    He talks about it in the email.  It was not                   16:37:14

15  what made me angry.                                                     16:37:16

16       Q    Got it.  What made you angry was what we've                   16:37:18

17  already talked about, personal attack with little                       16:37:21

18  information going to other executives at Walmart?                       16:37:23

19       A    That's correct.                                               16:37:26

20       Q    If folks at Zest were talking to Mr. Foran                    16:37:30

21  about you in a negative way, that would also make you                   16:37:39

22  angry, right?                                                           16:37:42

23       A    If I --                                                       16:37:46

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          16:37:48

25       A    If I was made aware of those things, I mean,                  16:37:49

 1  hypothetically.                                                         16:37:52

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah.  And you're fact                       16:37:54

 3  witness.  You're not here to answer hypotheticals.                      16:37:55

 4       A    Okay.                                                         16:37:58

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  So in this email that we're                  16:37:58

 6  looking at here in Exhibit 239.  Sorry.  There it is.                   16:38:00

 7  It appears that you had heard from someone that Zest was                16:38:12

 8  making negative comments to Mr. Foran, either about you                 16:38:18

 9  or about people -- or your organization, right?                         16:38:22

10       A    Where are you referring to here?                              16:38:26

11       Q    The email that we just looked at, Exhibit 239,                16:38:28

12  on the third page.  So don't run to Greg and say we are                 16:38:30

13  slow and dumb again.                                                    16:38:36

14       A    And what is your question?                                    16:38:47

15       Q    Yeah, by saying don't do this again, it                       16:38:50

16  appears that you believed it had happened before, right?                16:38:53

17       A    The general context and conversations were                    16:38:56

18  that those things were happening.                                       16:39:00

19       Q    Right.  And had you heard that general context                16:39:04

20  and conversation from someone?                                          16:39:08

21       A    I don't remember the specifics.                               16:39:14

22       Q    Someone had to have told you, right?                          16:39:16

23  Otherwise, there'd be no way for you to know, correct?                  16:39:19

24       A    Yes.                                                          16:39:22

25       Q    You don't remember who told you?                              16:39:23

 1       A    I don't.                                                      16:39:26

 2       Q    Did this -- let's go to the first page of                     16:39:32

 3  Exhibit 239.                                                            16:39:40

 4       A    Yep.  239, first page, yep.                                   16:39:41

 5       Q    The top, there's an email from you to Kathryn                 16:39:47

 6  McLay, correct?  And at the bottom of the first page,                   16:39:51

 7  there's an email from Kathryn McLay to you.  Do you see                 16:39:56

 8  that?                                                                   16:40:00

 9       A    Yes.                                                          16:40:00

10       Q    In Kathryn's email to you on May 21st, she                    16:40:01

11  says, The question in talent review from Greg was can                   16:40:05

12  Kelly aim before shooting.  Do you see that?                            16:40:08

13       A    Yep.                                                          16:40:11

14       Q    Greg -- in this context, do you know which                    16:40:12

15  Greg that is?                                                           16:40:15

16       A    Smith.                                                        16:40:16

17       Q    Okay.  And that was Kathryn's boss?                           16:40:17

18       A    That is correct.                                              16:40:21

19       Q    And then he reported directly to Greg Foran?                  16:40:23

20       A    Correct.                                                      16:40:27

21       Q    And do you recall this talent review process?                 16:40:28

22       A    Yes.                                                          16:40:33

23       Q    Was there a formal written review that you                    16:40:34

24  received that had this information about aiming before                  16:40:38

25  shooting?                                                               16:40:41
                                                         268



 1       A    There were -- no.  There's never any formal,                  16:40:42

 2  written communication.                                                  16:40:47

 3       Q    What is the talent -- what's the talent review                16:40:48

 4  process that this refers to?                                            16:40:50

 5       A    So each of the layers of management talked                    16:40:53

 6  specifically about their teams, and it reports up and                   16:40:58

 7  they review top talent, high potentials, senior                         16:41:03

 8  directors, HR, talent objectives, et cetera.                            16:41:12

 9       Q    And you said there's nothing in writing.  So                  16:41:17

10  is this all verbal?                                                     16:41:21

11       A    When it -- when you are talked about, it's                    16:41:22

12  verbal.                                                                 16:41:24

13       Q    Okay.  So there may be a written --                           16:41:25

14       A    Somewhere.                                                    16:41:27

15       Q    -- aggregation of information?                                16:41:27

16       A    Yeah.  I have no idea where it is.                            16:41:28

17       Q    You don't actually receive the written part?                  16:41:30

18       A    No.                                                           16:41:32

19       Q    Okay.  It's just who sits down with you to                    16:41:32

20  give you the review?                                                    16:41:35

21       A    In this particular case, nobody.  Kath sent me                16:41:39

22  an email.                                                               16:41:41

23       Q    Okay.  So this email here is actually the                     16:41:42

24  review?                                                                 16:41:44

25       A    Correct.                                                      16:41:45

 1       Q    Did Kathryn explain anymore what she meant by,                16:41:47

 2  Can Kelly aim before shooting?                                          16:41:52

 3       A    She didn't say that.  That was Greg's                         16:41:57

 4  question.                                                               16:42:00

 5       Q    Fair enough.  She is writing this email,                      16:42:03

 6  right?                                                                  16:42:05

 7       A    Yeah.                                                         16:42:06

 8       Q    She says it in the context of this email,                     16:42:07

 9  correct?                                                                16:42:09

10       A    She writes the email saying that's what Greg                  16:42:11

11  said.                                                                   16:42:14

12       Q    Okay.  Did she explain to you anymore about                   16:42:15

13  what Greg meant in your talent review?                                  16:42:18

14       A    Only what's in this email.                                    16:42:22

15       Q    Okay.  Is this the sum total of the entire                    16:42:24

16  process here?  You didn't have any conversations with                   16:42:29

17  her about this?                                                         16:42:31

18       A    No.                                                           16:42:32

19       Q    Based on this review process, what did you                    16:42:35

20  understand, Can Kelly aim before shooting, to mean?                     16:42:38

21       A    Yes.  So this is not even, probably, about                    16:42:43

22  five months into Greg Smith's tenure.  We were on a trip                16:42:50

23  on the West Coast.  I had just been given perishable                    16:42:58

24  consolidation, which is a project that is run out                       16:43:06

25  Corinne.  I did not start it.  I did not establish it.                  16:43:09
                                                         270



 1  I did not deploy it.  But it was a mess, and they gave                  16:43:13

 2  it to me because it needed end-to-end management.                       16:43:18

 3                 I took it on probably a couple of months                 16:43:23

 4  before this.  Greg was new.  He wasn't aware of it.  We                 16:43:26

 5  went to the DC.  It became a very contentious point.                    16:43:31

 6  There were two VPs in the room that had initiated it and                16:43:37

 7  led it.  They did not speak up nor did they own what had                16:43:41

 8  happened previous to me getting it.  It was perceived in                16:43:49

 9  that meeting that the whole project had been a mess                     16:43:55

10  because of my management.  There were three -- they                     16:44:00

11  weren't VPs.  They were SVPs.  They do not work with                    16:44:04

12  Walmart anymore.                                                        16:44:10

13                 That was the situation.  It was not                      16:44:11

14  appropriate for me to address it there given the level                  16:44:12

15  of people that were there and leaving me hanging.  Kath                 16:44:16

16  was very aware.  She understood it.  That's what this is                16:44:21

17  referring to.                                                           16:44:25

18       Q    And in that situation, did you shoot before                   16:44:26

19  you aimed, in some sense?                                               16:44:32

20       A    Not in this situation.  Because of where the                  16:44:36

21  project was, it didn't have data.  It didn't have a                     16:44:39

22  business case.  And he kept asking those questions,                     16:44:42

23  which are very important for a well-run project.  And I                 16:44:45

24  had to say no.  And the two gentlemen who had started                   16:44:49

25  the project and didn't have that information were not                   16:44:53

 1  forthright, given that six months in, that was their EVP                16:44:57

 2  and direct supervisor, and so I was left out to hung --                 16:45:01

 3  hang.                                                                   16:45:07

 4       Q    And the EVP there was Greg Smith?                             16:45:07

 5       A    That's correct.                                               16:45:11

 6       Q    Who were the SVPs that were there?                            16:45:11

 7       A    Tracy Rosser and Brian -- it's a long                         16:45:14

 8  spelling, Burdough, but I don't know how to spell it.                   16:45:21

 9  And I don't even -- Burdough.  It's -- anyway, Brian                    16:45:24

10  Burdough.  It's got some O's and U's and GH's.                          16:45:29

11       Q    Did you have a conversation with Mr. Smith                    16:45:36

12  about this issue --                                                     16:45:38

13       A    No.                                                           16:45:39

14       Q    -- after this?                                                16:45:40

15       A    I immediately left the room and conversed with                16:45:41

16  Kath, and she told me she would take care of it.                        16:45:44

17       Q    Okay.                                                         16:45:51

18       A    Which is what that paragraph speaks to.                       16:45:59

19       Q    And so when there's discussion about the in                   16:46:01

20  Corinne situation or the Corinne debacle, I think, as                   16:46:05

21  it's called in certain emails, that is the situation                    16:46:10

22  that that refers to?                                                    16:46:13

23       A    That particular meeting, it does.  And if you                 16:46:14

24  see here, it says, He asked who kicked it off.  I said                  16:46:17

25  transport.  He said, ah-ha.  Hence, the gentleman                       16:46:22

 1  doesn't work at Walmart anymore.                                        16:46:26

 2       Q    And that is -- the gentleman is Brian or Tracy                16:46:29

 3  or --                                                                   16:46:33

 4       A    That would be Tracy, who was the SVP of                       16:46:33

 5  transportation.  Now, clearly, this is not the reason                   16:46:38

 6  that he doesn't work at Walmart anymore but....                         16:46:40

 7       Q    Why do you say clearly, this is not the                       16:46:44

 8  reason?                                                                 16:46:45

 9       A    Because he's an SVP.  This is one project.                    16:46:45

10       Q    You say here when you're responding at the top                16:47:15

11  of the page.                                                            16:47:18

12       A    The top of what page?                                         16:47:23

13       Q    The top of this same page.                                    16:47:24

14       A    Yep.                                                          16:47:26

15       Q    We're still in the same exhibit.  You respond                 16:47:27

16  back to Ms. McLay, correct?                                             16:47:29

17       A    Yes.                                                          16:47:31

18       Q    You say, I took that feedback that the Corinne                16:47:38

19  debacle can be avoided if we handle Zest correctly.  See                16:47:41

20  that?                                                                   16:47:46

21       A    Yes.                                                          16:47:47

22       Q    What was the connection between Corinne and                   16:47:49

23  Zest?                                                                   16:47:53

24       A    There isn't --                                                16:47:56

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          16:47:59

 1                 THE WITNESS:  Oops, sorry.                               16:48:02

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Sorry.  It's my fault.  Go                   16:48:04

 3  ahead.                                                                  16:48:04

 4       A    There isn't.                                                  16:48:06

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Why were they being                   16:48:06

 6  discussed in this same email?                                           16:48:08

 7       A    Because the perspective of aiming before                      16:48:10

 8  shooting came from Corinne.  And then we moved on to me                 16:48:13

 9  talking about how I was handling other projects.                        16:48:16

10       Q    You go on to say, I should have been in                       16:48:27

11  command -- speaking about the Corinne situation, I                      16:48:30

12  should have been in command and I let it go.  I will not                16:48:34

13  allow that to happen with the Zest thing.                               16:48:38

14                 Do you see that?                                         16:48:40

15       A    Correct.  Was that a question?                                16:48:41

16                 MR. SAMMI:  Yeah, he said, do you see                    16:48:57

17  that?                                                                   16:49:00

18                 THE WITNESS:  Oh, okay.                                  16:49:00

19                 MR. SAMMI:  You said yes.                                16:49:02

20                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.                                      16:49:04

21                 MR. SAMMI:  That's the question.                         16:49:05

22                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.                                      16:49:07

23                 MR. SAMMI:  Whether you saw it.                          16:49:08

 1  a email from you to Gary Adams, as well as a number of                  16:50:10

 2  people, on July 27th, 2017, right?                                      16:50:14

 3       A    Yes.                                                          16:50:20

 4       Q    This particular email looks like it is talking                16:50:24

 5  about that break-out from a --                                          16:50:28

 6       A    The second one?                                               16:50:31

 7       Q    Yeah.  Break out from the Legacy Fresh                        16:50:32

 8  meeting.                                                                16:50:34

 9       A    Yes.  This is the one that I referred to                      16:50:35

10  earlier where they didn't remember that they had done                   16:50:38

11  something, and we had to go redo it.                                    16:50:40

12       Q    And that's why you say, He asked to do a                      16:50:48

13  deeper dive in the Fresh network.  I chose not to tell                  16:50:53

14  the CEO that he must have forgotten what I'd already --                 16:50:57

15  forgotten that we already did that.  See that?                          16:51:01

16       A    (Witness nods head.)                                          16:51:03

17       Q    And then you end it with "J".  What does "J"                  16:51:04

18  mean at the end?                                                        16:51:07

19       A    "J" is what happens when you put a smiley face                16:51:08

20  into a computer.                                                        16:51:12

21       Q    Got it.  So that was supposed to be a smiley                  16:51:13

22  face but it turned into a "J"?                                          16:51:16

23       A    No.  It was a smiley face.  The computer turns                16:51:19

24  it into a "J".                                                          16:51:22

25                 MR. SAMMI:  Am I hip enough to say emoji?                16:51:25

 1  It's an emoji.                                                          16:51:26

 2                 THE WITNESS:  Well, if my computer could                 16:51:28

 3  do an emoji, it would have stayed a smiley face.                        16:51:31

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  I see.                                       16:51:36

 5                 THE WITNESS:  That's just a colon and a                  16:51:36

 6  parentheses.                                                            16:51:38

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Do you remember talking to                   16:51:39

 8  Kathryn McLay about getting the information and doing                   16:51:41

 9  the evaluation of Zest based on testing versus                          16:51:47

10  collusion?  Do you remember that conversation with                      16:51:52

11  Ms. McLay?                                                              16:51:56

12       A    I do not.                                                     16:51:58

13       Q    The -- going back to Exhibit 240, you say that                16:52:05

14  you're going to take the slide that you had before and                  16:52:11

15  redo them into a new presentation, right?  If you look                  16:52:17

16  down at the bottom of the first paragraph.                              16:52:23

17       A    Yes.                                                          16:52:27

18       Q    Okay.  Overall, did you feel like this was a                  16:52:27

19  meeting that went well?                                                 16:52:30

20       A    Which meeting?                                                16:52:33

21       Q    The meeting that preceded the email in Exhibit                16:52:34

22  240.  In other words, you were at a meeting --                          16:52:38

23       A    The Legacy meeting?                                           16:52:41

24       Q    Yeah.                                                         16:52:45

25       A    Yeah.                                                         16:52:45

 1       Q    Okay.  So you say, Hi, all.  Today in Legacy                  16:52:45

 2  Fresh Flow, we talked about these things.  So that's the                16:52:47

 3  meeting I'm -- I'm referring to.                                        16:52:47

 4       A    When you say went well, what does that mean?                  16:52:50

 5       Q    Did you think there was any problem or issue                  16:52:54

 6  after this meeting?                                                     16:52:56

 7       A    I didn't think so.  There was some tension in                 16:53:00

 8  the room because they had forgotten what they knew.  And                16:53:05

 9  so there was a back and forth between Ed, my direct boss                16:53:09

10  and the EVP and potentially Greg Smith, where Greg Smith                16:53:14

11  was asked by Greg Foran, why didn't you talk to me about                16:53:21

12  this on Tuesday.  They didn't remember, and so there was                16:53:25

13  some tension in the room around why in Greg's -- both                   16:53:28

14  Gregs' perceptions that this hadn't been talked about or                16:53:30

15  communicated.  I knew that it had, so I did not consider                16:53:36

16  that a problem.  I knew they would remember when we                     16:53:40

17  showed it to them.                                                      16:53:43

18       Q    And that didn't happen until a later meeting,                 16:53:45

19  correct?                                                                16:53:50

20       A    Correct.                                                      16:53:51

21                  (Exhibit 241 was marked)                                16:54:04

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Take a look at what's been                   16:54:06

23  marked Exhibit 241.  I think this may be some of the                    16:54:07

24  tension that you're referring to.  This is an email from                16:54:11

25  Ed Oldham, who was your boss at the time to Kathryn                     16:54:13
                                                         277



 1  McLay, his boss, correct?                                               16:54:17

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to the question and                16:54:19

 3  the colloquy.                                                           16:54:24

 4       A    Say that again.  I'm sorry.                                   16:54:24

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.  This is from Ed Oldham                16:54:25

 6  to Kathryn McLay.                                                       16:54:25

 7       A    Yes.                                                          16:54:27

 8       Q    And at that time, Ed Oldham was your boss,                    16:54:27

 9  correct?                                                                16:54:29

10       A    That's correct.                                               16:54:30

11       Q    And then Kathryn McLay was his boss, correct?                 16:54:30

12       A    That is correct.                                              16:54:34

13       Q    And he says in the second paragraph, Greg S.                  16:54:35

14  came to see me after and was annoyed again.  See that?                  16:54:40

15       A    Yes.                                                          16:54:45

16       Q    Is this the tension that you referred to a                    16:54:46

17  moment ago?                                                             16:54:49

18       A    Yes.                                                          16:54:49

19                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, foundation.  Go                   16:54:51

20  ahead that.                                                             16:54:51

21       A    Yes.                                                          16:54:52

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  And it says, In the                          16:54:52

23  discussion on scaling, Greg -- Greg F. Foran, asked if                  16:54:55

24  we know where we want to the future FSCs.  Do you see                   16:55:01

25  that?                                                                   16:55:05

 1       A    Yes.                                                          16:55:06

 2       Q    FCSs are fresh consolidation centers?                         16:55:07

 3       A    Fresh solution centers.                                       16:55:11

 4       Q    Fresh solution centers.  Sorry.                               16:55:13

 5       A    Yes.                                                          16:55:13

 6       Q    And he says, Kelly said, paraphrasing, yes, I                 16:55:14

 7  know where I want them.  Five locations, cost a few                     16:55:14

 8  million each.  Mostly for systems.  Use 3PL if we want                  16:55:18

 9  to go fast.  Do you see that?                                           16:55:22

10       A    Yes.                                                          16:55:24

11       Q    Is that a roughly accurate paraphrase of what                 16:55:25

12  you said at the time.                                                   16:55:28

13       A    Yes.                                                          16:55:32

14       Q    3PL is?                                                       16:55:32

15       A    Third-party logistics.                                        16:55:34

16       Q    Says, Greg S. was frustrated about that and                   16:55:36

17  made it clear to me in private.                                         16:55:40

18                 So Greg Smith apparently was frustrated                  16:55:42

19  by the fact that you had provided this information or                   16:55:43

20  spoke up?                                                               16:55:46

23       A    Yeah, I'm --                                                  16:55:51

24       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  What was your understanding                  16:55:52

25  of how why he was frustrated?                                           16:55:53

 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Are you withdrawing the last                 16:55:58

 2  question?  Are you withdrawing the last question?                       16:56:01

 3                 MR. SIMONS:  Yeah.                                       16:56:07

 4                 MR. SAMMI:  Okay.  Can I have that one                   16:56:07

 5  again?                                                                  16:56:07

 6       Q    (BY MR. SAMMI)  What was your understanding of                16:56:09

 7  why he was frustrated?                                                  16:56:12

 8                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           16:56:14

 9       A    I don't know what they talked about in                        16:56:14

10  private.  What I watched happen in the meeting was Greg                 16:56:17

11  Foran asked Greg Smith why -- why didn't you show it to                 16:56:20

12  me on Tuesday.  I have no idea what happened on Tuesday.                16:56:25

13  I don't know what they talked about on Tuesday.  Greg                   16:56:28

14  Smith said a few things.  I answered some questions and                 16:56:31

15  we moved on.  I witnessed tension.                                      16:56:34

16       Q    Tension between Greg Smith and Greg Foran?                    16:56:41

17       A    Just tension in the room.                                     16:56:44

18       Q    And it goes on to say, As we discussed course                 16:56:51

19  correcting per my email yesterday, we will need to get                  16:56:55

20  Kelly firmly controlled from GS's POV.                                  16:56:59

21       A    Uh-huh.                                                       16:57:04

22       Q    GS is Greg Smith, right?                                      16:57:05

23       A    Yep.                                                          16:57:07

24       Q    And his POV is his point of view, right?                      16:57:08

25       A    Yep.                                                          16:57:12

 1       Q    Do you understand why Greg Smith felt like you                16:57:14

 2  needed to be firmly controlled?                                         16:57:17

 3                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form, foundation.                 16:57:20

 4       A    I -- I don't know the context exactly, but                    16:57:21

 5  remember, this is under the situation where he didn't                   16:57:25

 6  remember that he had had the extra information.                         16:57:28

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did Kathryn have a                           16:57:33

 8  conversation -- Ed or Kathryn have a conversation about                 16:57:36

 9  you being more firmly controlled?                                       16:57:40

10       A    Absolutely not.                                               16:57:44

11       Q    And the last sentence in the paragraph is,                    16:57:47

12  It's really antagonizing him.  That is Greg Smith,                      16:57:51

13  right?                                                                  16:57:54

18  about this Mr. Smith feeling antagonized by you?                        16:58:04

19       A    Ed and I talked about the fact that he was                    16:58:09

20  frustrated with the meeting and that all -- and because                 16:58:14

21  Ed was not also my boss when we had the first meeting or                16:58:19

22  at least wasn't in the first meeting that I remember.                   16:58:23

23  Kath was there.  So I'm sure Ed would have communicated                 16:58:27

24  to him remember this meeting, we had it.  You know this.                16:58:30

25  We've gone through it.  It's been -- you know, et                       16:58:33

 1  cetera.  He didn't know at the time, so all of this                     16:58:36

 2  frustration is based on Greg not remembering a meeting.                 16:58:39

 3  And it -- it really wasn't needed to be addressed.                      16:58:43

 4                 The only conversations I directly had                    16:58:47

 5  with Ed was on my performance, which was exactly what he                16:58:49

 6  stated in that last, that I did very well in the                        16:58:54

 7  meeting.                                                                16:58:57

 8       Q    Did anyone in management at Walmart do                        16:59:07

 9  anything to try and make sure that you were more firmly                 16:59:10

10  controlled, in the words of this email?                                 16:59:13

11       A    Never.                                                        16:59:15

12       Q    Nothing that you're aware of?                                 16:59:15

13       A    No.                                                           16:59:20

14       Q    Did you feel like you needed to be firmly                     16:59:20

15  controlled?                                                             16:59:23

16       A    No, no.                                                       16:59:23

17       Q    Is that -- is -- your current boss is -- I                    16:59:24

18  can't remember her name.                                                16:59:32

19       A    Monique.                                                      16:59:34

20       Q    If you can remind me.  Monique.  And her boss                 16:59:35

21  is who?                                                                 16:59:38

22       A    Greg Smith.                                                   16:59:38

23       Q    Okay.  So Greg Smith is still --                              16:59:39

24       A    EVP.                                                          16:59:41

25       Q    Still above you in the organization?                          16:59:42
                                                         282



 1       A    Absolutely.                                                   16:59:47

 2       Q    How's your relationship with Greg Smith                       16:59:47

 3  currently?                                                              16:59:49

 4       A    Great.                                                        16:59:50

 5       Q    Have you had conversations with him since this                16:59:51

 6  email about this situation or other tension between the                 16:59:54

 7  two of you?                                                             16:59:59

 8       A    I've never had conversations with him about                   17:00:00

 9  this situation, and I've never had conversations about                  17:00:02

10  tension with Greg Smith.                                                17:00:05

11       Q    Fair enough.  Have you had conversations with                 17:00:20

12  other people about tension, it sounds like, but not with                17:00:23

13  Greg Smith?                                                             17:00:27

14       A    I spoke to, as I said earlier, Ed about the                   17:00:27

15  tension in the room, that I was not worried about                       17:00:30

16  because both executives had forgotten about the hour we                 17:00:33

17  had spent on that particular topic nine months earlier                  17:00:37

18  or seven months earlier.                                                17:00:41

19                  (Exhibit 242 was marked)                                17:00:43

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  This is Exhibit 242.  This is                17:01:09

21  a October 24th, 2017 email between you and Ed Oldham,                   17:01:21

22  correct?                                                                17:01:29

23       A    Looks that way.  Let me review.                               17:01:30

24       Q    Sure.                                                         17:01:33

25       A    Yes.                                                          17:01:41

 1       Q    And if you look at the second email in the                    17:01:48

 2  chain here, it's an email from Denise Sharpe, to Ed                     17:01:53

 3  Oldham and yourself copying Kathryn McLay, correct?                     17:01:56

 4       A    Correct.                                                      17:02:01

 5       Q    And she makes a comment, Kelly just told me                   17:02:03

 6  that 3 million was for Deloitte, so I made a -- the                     17:02:06

 7  correction in the deck.                                                 17:02:09

 8       A    Correct.                                                      17:02:12

 9       Q    What is she discussing here?  What deck is                    17:02:12

10  this that she's talking about?                                          17:02:16

11       A    Oh, my God.  I have no idea particularly.                     17:02:18

12       Q    It looks like, if you look back in this email,                17:02:24

13  this is the deck that was going to go to the Legacy team                17:02:27

14  related to Zest, correct?  If you look down at the very                 17:02:37

15  first email in the chain, it says, If you make these                    17:02:46

16  tweaks in the first 24 hours, we can probably grab all                  17:02:50

17  the leaders X Greg F after 2:00 Thursday.  Legacy is                    17:02:54

18  ending early.                                                           17:02:54

19       A    This was not going to Legacy.                                 17:02:56

20       Q    Okay.  This was something that was going to                   17:02:57

21  be -- go to Greg after the Legacy meeting it looks like?                17:02:59

22       A    Correct.  Maybe.                                              17:03:04

23       Q    If you could catch him.                                       17:03:05

24       A    If -- if Ed could catch him.                                  17:03:06

25       Q    Okay.                                                         17:03:09

 1       A    I don't go to those meetings.                                 17:03:10

 2       Q    Got it.  And if you -- you can see the                        17:03:13

 3  attachment, is a presentation that you were working on                  17:03:15

 4  or that Ms. Sharpe was working on with you related to                   17:03:28

 5  Zest, correct?                                                          17:03:32

 6       A    That is correct.                                              17:03:34

 7       Q    So when she says, Kelly just told me that                     17:03:36

 8  3 million was for Deloitte, so I made the correction in                 17:03:39

 9  the deck, does that now refresh your recollection of                    17:03:42

10  what this deck was that you were working on?                            17:03:46

11       A    Yes.                                                          17:03:48

12       Q    Okay.  Do you know what she was talking about                 17:03:49

13  here, that the 3 million was for Deloitte, the change                   17:03:51

14  that she made?                                                          17:03:54

15       A    I need to find it in the deck --                              17:03:55

16       Q    Sure.                                                         17:03:57

17       A    -- to see.                                                    17:03:57

18       Q    I think, if you go to the one Bates labeled,                  17:03:58

19  WM00062406, there's some discussion about Deloitte on                   17:04:12

20  that slide.                                                             17:04:21

21       A    I don't see 3 million.  Oh, there it is,                      17:04:50

22  3 million.  Got it.                                                     17:04:52

23       Q    Does that refresh your recollection where the                 17:04:59

24  3 million related to Deloitte --                                        17:05:02

25       A    Yes.                                                          17:05:04

 1       Q    -- came from?  Your response to Ed Oldham                     17:05:04

 2  alone is, oh, my God.  She doesn't want to work with me.                17:05:09

 3       A    Right.                                                        17:05:14

 4       Q    You're talking about Denise Sharpe, right?                    17:05:15

 5       A    Yes.                                                          17:05:17

 6       Q    What do you mean by oh, my God; she doesn't                   17:05:18

 7  want to work with me?                                                   17:05:22

 8       A    If you knew how many edits this poor woman                    17:05:23

 9  did.  I mean, it's -- you know, it starts -- it's just a                17:05:27

10  deck-happy environment.  And so she had done several                    17:05:31

11  edits, and I still had to tell her yet another one.  So                 17:05:36

12  it was -- it was just me being funny.                                   17:05:43

13       Q    That she didn't -- because of the number of                   17:05:47

14  edits?                                                                  17:05:50

15       A    Because -- right.  I mean, she just became a                  17:05:50

16  deck editor.                                                            17:05:53

17       Q    And there were many, many versions of this                    17:05:58

18  presentation that were prepared in the October --                       17:06:02

19       A    I don't know -- I don't know about final                      17:06:07

20  versions.  I do know we made many edits.                                17:06:10

21       Q    Right.  And when I say not many final                         17:06:13

22  versions, I mean there were many versions because there                 17:06:17

23  were lots of edits, right?                                              17:06:20

24                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           17:06:24

25       A    Some of the edits were done, we'd pop it on to                17:06:25

 1  my screen in my office.  Someone would come in.  We'd --                17:06:27

 2  like, edits aren't always -- we'd go to lunch, we'd come                17:06:30

 3  back, it would stay there.  I mean, like, there are many                17:06:35

 4  edits.  I don't know how many versions.                                 17:06:38

 5       Q    Fair enough.  And when you say people would                   17:06:41

 6  come in your office and you'd look at it on the screen,                 17:06:43

 7  who was there with you making edits?                                    17:06:45

 8       A    Ed, Denise, myself.                                           17:06:48

 9       Q    Anyone else?                                                  17:06:52

10       A    That's all I can remember at that point.                      17:06:55

11       Q    Do you remember any of the edits that you                     17:07:01

12  contributed changes that you suggested besides 3 million                17:07:03

13  for Deloitte, which appears to be one that you                          17:07:06

14  suggested?                                                              17:07:09

15       A    I don't.  I'm not a big editor myself.  I                     17:07:13

16  prefer --                                                               17:07:21

17       Q    Although, it appears in this scenario, you                    17:07:22

18  were, right?                                                            17:07:25

19       A    I was just the last edit that could have been                 17:07:26

20  the straw.                                                              17:07:29

21       Q    Did Denise complain about the number of edits?                17:07:33

22       A    No.                                                           17:07:36

23       Q    Or complain about --                                          17:07:37

24       A    No.  We were laughing together about the                      17:07:38

25  amount of edits.                                                        17:07:41

 1       Q    Why -- what was funny about the fact that                     17:07:43

 2  there was so my edits?                                                  17:07:45

 3       A    Because there were a lot of edits.                            17:07:49

 4       Q    Is there a particular reason why there were so                17:07:51

 5  many in this instance compared to other instances?                      17:07:54

 6       A    It's not just in this instance.  That's why                   17:07:56

 7  it's funny.  It's a deck-happy culture.  Coming from                    17:07:57

 8  outside the company, it's a deck-happy culture.                         17:08:02

15  take a break.                                                           17:08:21

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  I want to go back to                         17:22:56

23  Exhibit 239 briefly.  Hopefully, it's near the top of                   17:22:57

24  your stack.  Look at the second page of Exhibit 239.                    17:23:03

 1  write, Zest, we're finally getting all the information                  17:23:12

 2  and we'll be collaborating on KPIs and testing versus                   17:23:17

 3  collusion.  No, that's not a typo.  And here, your                      17:23:23

 4  smiley face did come through.                                           17:23:26

 5       A    Yes.                                                          17:23:32

 6       Q    What do you mean by testing vs. collusion?                    17:23:33

 7  What collusion were you referring to?                                   17:23:34

 8       A    I have -- I really don't have any idea, but I                 17:23:38

 9  thought it was cute, which is why I put a smiley face,                  17:23:42

10  so it clearly was more of a said-in-jest.                               17:23:48

11       Q    Did you feel like there was collusion going on                17:23:51

12  related to Zest?                                                        17:23:54

13       A    I would not have put a smiley face because                    17:23:56

14  that would not be funny if I thought that was the case.                 17:23:58

15       Q    Okay.  So you did not feel like there was                     17:24:02

16  collusion going on?  It was just a joke?                                17:24:04

17       A    Not officially collusion.  I'm sure it was                    17:24:07

18  said in jest.  Otherwise, I would not have put a smiley                 17:24:11

19  face.                                                                   17:24:15

20       Q    Does this collusion in jest refer to the                      17:24:15

21  notion that Zest had a relationship with Greg Foran?  Is                17:24:17

22  that what the joke was about?                                           17:24:21

23       A    No.  Zest had many relationships across all of                17:24:23

24  Walmart.                                                                17:24:28

25       Q    And so that's what you were joking about here?                17:24:30

 1       A    I don't really remember the specifics, but it                 17:24:35

 2  was not about just one relationship because there were                  17:24:39

 3  many.                                                                   17:24:44

 5       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Let's take a look at                         17:24:59

 6  Exhibit 243.  This is an email from Kathryn McLay to Ed                 17:25:01

 7  Oldham.  And if you look at the August 2nd email, the                   17:25:09

 8  second one in the chain, Ed says, I talked to Kyle at                   17:25:15

 9  Deloitte this p.m. for an hour.  Were you involved in                   17:25:23

10  the conversation that he had with Kyle at Deloitte?                     17:25:28

11       A    Not that I recall.                                            17:25:32

12       Q    He goes on to say, Some Zest, some Win in                     17:25:33

13  Fresh, some let's get all our cards on the table about                  17:25:37

14  what Deloitte is telling Greg.                                          17:25:42

15                 Was there some concern about what                        17:25:45

16  Deloitte was telling to Greg Foran?                                     17:25:46

19       A    I have no idea what he's writing this email                   17:25:53

20  about.                                                                  17:25:56

21       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  He goes on to say, I                  17:25:57

22  have some insights about how about we put a cork in the                 17:25:59

23  Zest issue.                                                             17:26:05

24                 Do you have any idea what he's talking                   17:26:05

 2       Q    Did you ever have a conversation with Ed or                   17:26:11

 3  Kathryn about putting a cork in the Zest issue?                         17:26:14

 5       Q    Take a look at what's been marked previously                  17:26:30

 6  as Exhibit 119.  This is an email chain between Denise                  17:26:33

 8       A    Yes.                                                          17:26:45

 9       Q    And if you look at the email down in the --                   17:26:45

10       A    I'm sorry.                                                    17:26:52

11       Q    Oh, sorry.                                                    17:26:53

12       A    My candy is going to be very loud on this, and                17:26:53

13  I just realized that.  I apologize for the video guy.                   17:26:56

14       Q    If you look at email sort of in the middle of                 17:27:02

15  the page, Denise writes to you, Take a look at the                      17:27:04

16  second slide.  I'll have the data points for the first                  17:27:09

17  Emerson sensor either later today or early next week.                   17:27:12

18  That's the one I'd like to recommend for the pilot.                     17:27:16

19                 Do you see that?                                         17:27:19

20       A    Yes.                                                          17:27:20

21       Q    This is -- she's -- this is during the POC,                   17:27:21

22  right, the proof of concept or the bake-off?                            17:27:26

23       A    That's correct.                                               17:27:29

25  you're going to choose.                                                 17:27:33

 3       A    For the pilot, correct.                                       17:27:38

 4       Q    The next step?                                                17:27:40

 5       A    That's correct.                                               17:27:41

 6       Q    And she says -- she doesn't have all the data                 17:27:42

 7  points yet for Emerson but that's the one that she's                    17:27:44

 8  going to recommend for the pilot, right?                                17:27:47

 9       A    Uh-huh.                                                       17:27:50

10       Q    Any reason why she was ready to make the                      17:27:50

11  recommendation despite the fact that she doesn't have                   17:27:56

12  all the data points?                                                    17:28:00

14       A    She might have 98 percent of them.                            17:28:05

15       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.                                        17:28:07

16       A    Just doesn't have a hundred percent.  I                       17:28:09

17  don't -- I don't know that means.                                       17:28:12

18       Q    You don't know?  You didn't have a                            17:28:13

19  conversation with her about how much data she had when                  17:28:15

20  the recommendation was made?                                            17:28:19

 2  Mischaracterizes the document.  Please go ahead.                        17:28:31

 3       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.                                        17:28:32

 4       A    Other than this email chain?                                  17:28:33

 5       Q    Yes.                                                          17:28:34

 6       A    Not that I remember.                                          17:28:34

 7       Q    Okay.  Who made the decision about who you                    17:28:36

 8  were going to choose for the pilot?                                     17:28:39

 9       A    We made a collective recommendation.  And then                17:28:41

10  it was shared with leadership, who shared it with more                  17:28:44

11  leadership.                                                             17:28:48

12       Q    And when you say, "we made a collective                       17:28:49

13  recommendation," who was "we" that made the                             17:28:51

14  recommendation?                                                         17:28:56

15       A    Denise, Jon, Stephen provided information.                    17:28:57

16  The collective team.                                                    17:29:06

17       Q    And when you say Jon, which Jon are you                       17:29:08

18  talking about, John Fox?                                                17:29:11

19       A    Yeah.                                                         17:29:13

20       Q    And Stephen is Stephen Steele?                                17:29:13

21       A    Yes.                                                          17:29:15

22       Q    And when did you make the decision?                           17:29:20

23       A    If I remember correctly, it was sometime in                   17:29:27

24  the fall of 2017.                                                       17:29:30

25       Q    Do you remember anything more specific than                   17:29:34
                                                         293



 1  the fall of 2017?                                                       17:29:36

 2       A    Not specifically.                                             17:29:37

 3                  (Exhibit 244 was marked)                                17:29:38

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Sorry.  I think there's two                  17:29:45

 5  there.  I apologize.  Oh, maybe there's not.                            17:29:47

 6                 This is 244.  Exhibit 244 is a                           17:30:11

 7  October 10th, 2017 email attaching new decks, Cold Chain                17:30:18

 8  compliance.  Do you see that?                                           17:30:30

 9       A    Uh-huh.                                                       17:30:34

10       Q    These decks are versions of the deck that you                 17:30:36

11  were editing with Ms. Sharpe related to the POC,                        17:30:40

12  correct?                                                                17:30:45

13       A    That is correct.                                              17:30:46

14       Q    And if you look at slide 13, which is the                     17:30:50

15  Bates number ending in 66.  And I apologize, it's                       17:30:53

16  somewhat small.  But if you look at the top right-hand                  17:31:02

17  corner, it says, Emerson auto sense is listed as the                    17:31:12

18  first place finisher.  And for the sensor count, do you                 17:31:17

19  see where it says 39 limited test?                                      17:31:21

20       A    Yes.                                                          17:31:24

21       Q    So the winning vendor only had 39 sensors in                  17:31:25

22  the evaluation?                                                         17:31:33

23       A    Yes.                                                          17:31:34

24       Q    Is that enough to evaluate the vendor?                        17:31:35

25       A    Yes.                                                          17:31:38

 1       Q    Why didn't you do more?  Why didn't you do a                  17:31:38

 2  hundred -- you know, 1500 with the next one.  All the                   17:31:41

 3  rest of are in the hundreds.  Some -- most of them, more                17:31:44

 4  than a thousand, but the winner only had 39.  Is there a                17:31:47

 5  reason why?                                                             17:31:50

 6       A    Each vendor determined the number of sensors.                 17:31:53

 7       Q    So you didn't have any requirement as to how                  17:31:57

 8  many sensors they were going to need in order to be a                   17:31:59

 9  valid test of the technology?                                           17:32:04

10       A    Our requirements were based on the evaluation                 17:32:07

11  of the results not a number of sensors.                                 17:32:09

12       Q    Did you personally look at the results for the                17:32:22

13  39 sensors at issue here?                                               17:32:25

14       A    I don't remember specifically all the results                 17:32:30

15  that I looked at.                                                       17:32:34

16       Q    And it looks like you didn't get the data for                 17:32:42

17  these Emerson sensors until at least late in September,                 17:32:49

18  right, if you look back to Exhibit 119?                                 17:32:53

19       A    119?  Oh.                                                     17:32:58

20       Q    No, it's the last exhibit you just had.                       17:33:00

21       A    Oh, jeez.                                                     17:33:01

22       Q    I know.  It sounded like we were going way                    17:33:04

23  back but it's one of the -- it's this one-pager.                        17:33:06

24       A    All right.  Yeah.  There you go.  Okay.                       17:33:10

25       Q    Yeah.                                                         17:33:13

 1       A    So this does not say that.                                    17:33:18

 2       Q    It says, I'll have the data points for the                    17:33:26

 3  first Emerson sensor either later today or early next                   17:33:31

 4  week.                                                                   17:33:36

 5       A    That speaks to when Denise would have them,                   17:33:36

 6  not when we would have received all of the data.                        17:33:39

 7       Q    Did you receive the data separately from                      17:33:42

 8  Denise?                                                                 17:33:45

 9       A    I did.                                                        17:33:45

10       Q    Did you have the data for these sensors before                17:33:46

11  she had it?                                                             17:33:49

12       A    Nope.                                                         17:33:50

13       Q    Okay.  So it looks like Denise, at least the                  17:33:50

14  one she said she's going to be making the                               17:33:56

15  recommendation.  And she did not have the data at that                  17:33:59

16  point, correct?                                                         17:34:03

18  Mischaracterizes the document.                                          17:34:06

19       A    She had some amount of data in her possession,                17:34:08

20  but this does not speak to how much data was available.                 17:34:12

21       Q    Well, she says -- she doesn't say she has any                 17:34:17

22  data.  She says, I'll have the data points for the first                17:34:21

23  Emerson sensor either later today or early next week,                   17:34:24

24  right?                                                                  17:34:29

25       A    That's correct.                                               17:34:29

 1       Q    So it doesn't indicate that she has any data,                 17:34:30

 4       A    I don't know what she has or hasn't.  It just                 17:34:36

 5  says what it says.                                                      17:34:39

 6       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Did you have any                      17:34:41

 7  Emerson data at this point?                                             17:34:41

 8       A    No, I did not.                                                17:34:43

 9                 (Exhibit 245 was marked)                                 17:34:44

10       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Okay.  Next exhibit is 245.                  17:34:44

11  Bates label ending in 61136.  This indicates that Denise                17:35:10

12  has completed the POC for the Cold Chain vendors along                  17:35:27

13  with the analysis of what technology she wants to                       17:35:31

14  recommend for the pilot, right, as of October 16th,                     17:35:34

15  2017?                                                                   17:35:38

16       A    It does not say that.                                         17:35:39

17       Q    The first sentence there?                                     17:35:40

18       A    It says "we" not "she".                                       17:35:41

19       Q    So it says Denise has completed --                            17:35:45

20       A    Yeah.                                                         17:35:49

21       Q    That we want to recommend; is that what you're                17:35:50

22  correcting?                                                             17:35:52

23       A    Yes, yes.                                                     17:35:53

24       Q    Got it.  Now, is this -- this is the same                     17:35:53

25  recommendation that we've been talking about, right --                  17:35:56

 1                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           17:36:00

 2       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  -- in the last few exhibits?                 17:36:01

 3       A    I believe so.                                                 17:36:08

 4       Q    If you look at the last sentence in this first                17:36:09

 5  paragraph, It says, We need to get it in front of the                   17:36:15

 6  logistic leadership team and come up with a reco on how                 17:36:18

 7  to cut the cord.                                                        17:36:23

 8                 Is cutting the cord meaning getting rid                  17:36:24

 9  of Zest?                                                                17:36:28

10       A    It means that we are not going to be using the                17:36:29

11  other vendors.                                                          17:36:32

12       Q    This specifically is talking about Zest,                      17:36:35

13  right, how to cut the cord with Zest?                                   17:36:37

14       A    Yep.  It would be the same with the other                     17:36:40

15  vendors, but yes.                                                       17:36:42

16       Q    Well, was there a process for cutting the cord                17:36:44

17  with the other vendors involved in the POC?                             17:36:47

18       A    Of course.                                                    17:36:51

19       Q    Was it similar to the process of cutting the                  17:36:53

20  cord with Zest?                                                         17:36:56

21       A    It was not as extensive.                                      17:36:57

22       Q    And why was -- why was that?                                  17:36:59

23       A    Zest had some relationships --                                17:37:04

24       Q    Okay.                                                         17:37:07

25       A    -- that we needed to be very sensitive to and                 17:37:07

 1  -- and respectful of.  And make sure that we were                       17:37:12

 2  handling the information appropriately.  And the other                  17:37:17

 3  vendors were not as entangled with those things that we                 17:37:21

 4  needed to consider.                                                     17:37:26

 5       Q    Didn't have the long -- the same length of                    17:37:27

 6  relationship as Zest had with Walmart?                                  17:37:30

 7       A    Some of them have a long relationship, just                   17:37:33

 8  maybe not as complicated.                                               17:37:37

 9       Q    Okay.  This has previously been marked as                     17:37:39

10  Exhibit 113, an email from you to Ed Oldham and Denise                  17:37:52

11  Sharpe.                                                                 17:38:04

12       A    Yes.                                                          17:38:06

13       Q    And you say, First stab at deck for                           17:38:07

14  elimination of Zest, right?                                             17:38:10

15       A    Correct.                                                      17:38:11

16       Q    So the purpose of this deck, as you describe                  17:38:12

17  it here, was to eliminate Zest?                                         17:38:15

18       A    The communication of the recommendation is the                17:38:18

19  purpose.                                                                17:38:23

20       Q    But what -- the way you described this deck is                17:38:26

21  a deck for the elimination of Zest.                                     17:38:29

22       A    Out of the pilot, correct.  Eliminating Zest                  17:38:32

23  is not part of the pilot.                                               17:38:36

24       Q    And really, you're going to be eliminating                    17:38:38

25  Zest more than just out of the pilot, right?  You were                  17:38:41

 2                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             17:38:48

 3  Mischaracterizes testimony.                                             17:38:48

 4       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You can answer.                              17:38:53

 5       A    I was only eliminating them out of my pilot.                  17:38:54

 6  What they were doing with other things, I had no control                17:38:57

 7  over.                                                                   17:39:00

 8       Q    And when you say "they," what do you -- who                   17:39:01

 9  were you referring to?                                                  17:39:03

10       A    Zest.                                                         17:39:05

11       Q    This has been previously marked as Exhibit                    17:39:05

12  114.  Do you have an understanding as to why you were                   17:39:29

13  directly involved with this process of, as the prior                    17:39:49

14  email called it, eliminating Zest?  Why it sort of fell                 17:39:57

15  in your domain.                                                         17:40:02

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You can answer.                              17:40:12

18       A    As with other projects I've mentioned, often,                 17:40:15

19  the complexity of the projects and pilots that were                     17:40:18

20  being run, that were end to end, were difficult to run                  17:40:20

21  in -- within a function.  And because I'm a staff                       17:40:28

22  function that crosses many functions and influences                     17:40:35

23  across, I end -- I ended up getting projects that often                 17:40:39

24  needed that help.                                                       17:40:47

25       Q    Take a look at Exhibit 114 that you have in                   17:40:52

 1  front of you.  It looks like this is a continuation of                  17:40:54

 2  your discussions with Ed Oldham and Ms. Sharpe working                  17:41:01

 3  on this same deck, correct?                                             17:41:05

 4       A    You're feeling my pain.                                       17:41:09

 5       Q    So this is part of what you were describing                   17:41:10

 6  before, many edits but, also, we've now seen a number of                17:41:13

 7  versions, correct?                                                      17:41:19

 8       A    Yes.                                                          17:41:20

 9       Q    And Ed is providing comments on one of the                    17:41:21

10  versions on this particular day, correct?                               17:41:30

11       A    That is correct.                                              17:41:32

12       Q    And it looks like he said, it's always                        17:41:32

13  tempting to say what you feel are pertinent details but                 17:41:33

14  the EVP, SVP level, it's usually better to distill it                   17:41:38

15  down to only what they need to know.  They will trust us                17:41:44

16  on the rest.                                                            17:41:47

17                 Do you see that?                                         17:41:49

18       A    Uh-huh.                                                       17:41:50

19       Q    Do you agree with his assessment on that?                     17:41:51

20                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           17:41:54

21       A    I actually do not.                                            17:41:55

22       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  You do not?                                  17:41:57

23       A    No.                                                           17:41:58

24       Q    In terms of how this particular presentation                  17:41:58

25  was prepared, is that what ended up happening, even if                  17:42:00

 1  you didn't necessarily agree with it?  Did Ed's ultimate                17:42:04

 2  preferences rule the day?                                               17:42:08

 3       A    You asked me if I agree with that statement in                17:42:12

 4  general.  I do not agree with that statement in general.                17:42:17

 5       Q    Okay.                                                         17:42:19

 6       A    This particular deck, Ed was controlling the                  17:42:20

 7  edits.                                                                  17:42:24

 8       Q    Okay.                                                         17:42:25

 9       A    I did not challenge it, nor did I feel the                    17:42:26

10  necessary need to challenge it.                                         17:42:30

11       Q    So in the end, even if you didn't necessarily                 17:42:31

12  agree with it, that's the way it went because Ed --                     17:42:34

13                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection, form.                             17:42:39

14  Mischaracterizes testimony.                                             17:42:40

15       A    I said I don't agree with the general                         17:42:42

16  statement.                                                              17:42:45

17       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Yeah.                                        17:42:45

18       A    I said I didn't have any reason to disagree                   17:42:45

19  with what he was doing here.                                            17:42:48

20       Q    Understood.  So ultimately, what happened was                 17:42:50

21  you did distill it down to just what they needed to know                17:42:53

22  and have them trust you on the rest in this situation?                  17:42:57

23                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           17:43:00

24       A    From his perspective, what we ended up with                   17:43:01

25  was something he was happy with.  He would need to                      17:43:05

 1  decide if it met those criteria.                                        17:43:08

 2       Q    Okay.  But, I think, as you said, you did not                 17:43:11

 3  challenge this preference that he expressed here in this                17:43:14

 4  email?                                                                  17:43:18

 5                 MR. SAMMI:  Objection to form.                           17:43:20

 6       A    That is correct.                                              17:43:20

 7       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Did the ultimate presentation                17:43:21

 8  end up being distilled down from what you had in earlier                17:43:23

 9  versions?                                                               17:43:28

10       A    I have absolutely -- like, seriously, like,                   17:43:32

11  it's already five days between the last two and so I --                 17:43:35

12  I -- I would have to go through all of them to tell you                 17:43:39

13  what we pulled out and what we edited.  I mean, he's                    17:43:42

14  doing title editing at this point on some of these, so                  17:43:46

15  that's not necessarily detail.                                          17:43:49

16       Q    Who ultimately did the presentation or who                    17:43:52

17  ultimately provided the presentation to the EVP/SVP                     17:43:56

18  level?                                                                  17:44:02

19       A    That's a good question.  It was probably Ed or                17:44:02

20  myself.  I don't know for sure.                                         17:44:08

21       Q    Okay.  And, now, there was a meeting with Zest                17:44:12

22  on November 9th, 2017?                                                  17:44:15

23       A    Correct.                                                      17:44:18

24       Q    Right?                                                        17:44:18

25       A    Correct.                                                      17:44:19

 1       Q    Was there a meeting with senior leadership at                 17:44:19

 2  Walmart before that meeting to prepare for the meeting                  17:44:23

 3  with Zest?                                                              17:44:26

 4       A    I am aware of those meetings.  I was not part                 17:44:27

 5  of them.                                                                17:44:30

 6       Q    Okay.  Do you know who was?                                   17:44:31

 7       A    Who was part of them?                                         17:44:32

 8       Q    Yes.                                                          17:44:34

 9       A    I don't know for sure.                                        17:44:34

10       Q    Okay.  But you were not?                                      17:44:35

11       A    I was not.                                                    17:44:36

12       Q    Your roll in this process, I think, as you                    17:44:38

13  described, was you were working with Denise and Ed on                   17:44:41

14  making a recommendation.  You put this presentation                     17:44:46

15  together.  And then did Ed take it on its way up to                     17:44:51

16  senior leadership, or did somebody else take it from you                17:44:57

17  and take it out?                                                        17:45:02

18                 MR. SAMMI:  Object to the form.                          17:45:03

19       A    So can we break that up?                                      17:45:06

20       Q    (BY MR. SIMONS)  Sure.  Why don't you describe                17:45:07

21  the process as you understood it.                                       17:45:10

22       A    So Denise and I worked on the recommendation.                 17:45:13

23  Denise and I and Ed worked on the deck.  And then Ed                    17:45:18

24  took it from there.                                                     17:45:24

25       Q    And did you have visibility into what occurred                17:45:27
                                                         304



 1  after Ed took it from there?                                            17:45:30

 2       A    No visibility.                                                17:45:32

 3       Q    Did Ed report back to you as to what happened?                17:45:35

 4       A    I'm sure he did.                                              17:45:39

 5       Q    That means you were not in the meetings with                  17:45:44

 6  senior leadership, and you were not in the meetings with                17:45:46

 7  sensors, correct?                                                       17:45:49

 8       A    I was in the meeting with Zest.                               17:45:50

 9       Q    Okay.  You weren't in the meeting with senior                 17:45:53

10  leadership?                                                             17:45:57

11       A    Correct.                                                      17:45:58

12       Q    So after the meeting with senior leadership,                  17:45:58

13  before the meeting with Zest, did Ed come back to you                   17:46:01

14  and give you information or a download about what                       17:46:04

15  happened in the prior meeting?                                          17:46:09

16       A    I don't remember specifically, but we moved                   17:46:10

17  forward so I'm sure he probably communicated everything                 17:46:13

18  was fine.                                                               17:46:17

19       Q    And --                                                        17:46:19

20       A    We didn't change anything.                                    17:46:20

21       Q    Did you use a presentation in the meeting with                17:46:21

22  Zest?                                                                   17:46:25

23       A    Yes.                                                          17:46:26

24       Q    Was it the same presentation that you had                     17:46:27

25  used, that you had prepared and sent up with Ed Oldham?                 17:46:29
                                                         305



 1       A    Because I wasn't in those meetings, I can't --                17:46:37

 2  I have no idea exactly what he shared.                                  17:46:39

 3       Q    Right.  So what I'm saying is a little bit                    17:46:42

 4  different; that is, you and Denise and Ed worked on a                   17:46:45

 5  presentation, right?                                                    17:46:49

 6       A    Correct.                                                      17:46:50

 7       Q    Was that presentation the same presentation                   17:46:50

 8  that was used in the meeting with Zest?                                 17:46:52

 9       A    I have no idea.  I'd have to look.                            17:46:54

10       Q    Okay.  Who made the presentation in the                       17:46:56

11  meeting with Zest?                                                      17:46:59

12       A    It was a collective group.                                    17:47:01

13       Q    Did you have a portion of it that you did?                    17:47:05

14       A    I remember being in the meeting.  I don't                     17:47:14

15  remember who talked to what specifically.                               17:47:17

16       Q    Do you recall that the meeting began with                     17:47:29

17  someone saying to Zest this meeting is not going to go                  17:47:35

18  the way that you think it's going to go?                                17:47:39

19       A    I don't -- I know I didn't say that.  I don't                 17:47:43

20  remember if someone said that and who it was if they                    17:47:47

21  did.                                                                    17:47:51

22       Q    Do you remember any of the specifics of what                  17:47:52

23  was said in the meeting or what was discussed in the                    17:47:55

24  meeting with Zest?                                                      17:47:59

25       A    I don't remember the specifics.                               17:48:01

 1       Q    Do you remember anything?  Anything stand out                 17:48:03

 2  in your mind?                                                           17:48:07

 3       A    I remember Randy was there, Peter was there, I                17:48:08

 4  was there, Ed was there, Kath was there.  I don't know                  17:48:11

 5  if anyone else was there.  It was -- I remember what                    17:48:14

 6  room it was in.  And it's a fairly small room, so there                 17:48:16

 7  couldn't have been too many more people there.                          17:48:21

 8       Q    Anything else that you recall that stands out                 17:48:24

 9  in your mind about the meeting?                                         17:48:26

10       A    The deck was projected.  And it was not a very                17:48:28

12       Q    When you say not very long, how long do you                   17:48:36

13  recall it lasting?                                                      17:48:40

14       A    I don't know.  Thirty minutes, maybe.  Forty                  17:48:41

15  minutes, twenty minutes.  It just wasn't -- it wasn't                   17:48:43

16  lengthy.                                                                17:48:46

19       A    Kath probably -- I don't remember her talking                 17:48:54

20  much.  And I don't remember the difference between Ed                   17:48:57

21  and I.                                                                  17:49:00

 5  that what you're asking?  Did they jump up?  I mean,                    17:49:33

 7  conversation.                                                           17:49:39

13  reason, I think I remember being them surprised, but I                  17:50:07

 9       A    Not that I recall.                                            17:52:44

10       Q    I think you said you don't remember having a                  17:53:01

19       A    I don't.  It would have been after the                        17:53:44

20  negotiations that Ed was working through or almost                      17:53:47

 1  meeting, are you ready?  Is that at the end of the                      17:54:23

 2  meeting, Randy gave me a hug.                                           17:54:26

 3       Q    Any -- any reason why or was there something                  17:54:31

 4  that he said when that happened?                                        17:54:34

 5       A    He just said, Give me a hug.  And it was very                 17:54:36

 6  uncomfortable.                                                          17:54:39

 7       Q    Why was it uncomfortable?                                     17:54:40

 8       A    I'm not a hugger.                                             17:54:42

 9       Q    Okay.  Anything else that you recall?                         17:54:46

10       A    At that particular time, it was still he had                  17:54:47

11  to go to his board, so they had not requested all of the                17:55:01

12  1.5 in consulting services yet.  We -- the -- what was                  17:55:07

13  talked about in that meeting was a lump sum.  And he                    17:55:13

14  started asking about a way to work or stay engaged.  And                17:55:20

15  that conversation began there.                                          17:55:25

16       Q    Anything else that you can recall about that                  17:55:32

17  meeting?                                                                17:55:34

18       A    No.                                                           17:55:34

19       Q    Oh, sorry.  I think perhaps there are two                     17:55:54

20  copies there.                                                           17:55:57

21       A    There are.                                                    17:55:58

22       Q    Too quick to pass.                                            17:56:01

23       A    Yeah.                                                         17:56:02

24       Q    This is an exhibit that was marked in a prior                 17:56:10

25  deposition, Plaintiff's Exhibit 52, the Eden -- the tech                17:56:13

 1  that brings -- the tech that's bringing fresher                         17:56:17

 2  groceries to you, March 1st 2018.  Are you familiar with                17:56:20

 3  this blog post?                                                         17:56:24

 5       Q    If you look at the third page -- I'm sorry,                   17:56:26

 6  the second page.  My apologies.  The very last                          17:56:34

 7  paragraph.  It says, Eden also helps eliminate food                     17:56:37

 8  waste.  Our goal is to eliminate 2 billion in waste                     17:56:42

 9  other the next five years.  Already, Eden is being used                 17:56:46

10  in 42 distribution centers and has prevented 86 million                 17:56:49

13       A    Yes.                                                          17:56:56

14       Q    It's my understanding from -- well, let me ask                17:56:57

15  this:  Were you involved in calculating either of these                 17:57:01

16  numbers, 86 million or 2 billion?                                       17:57:04

17       A    Directly calculating?                                         17:57:08

18       Q    Directly or indirectly.                                       17:57:11

19       A    Directly calculating, no.  And I don't know                   17:57:12

20  what indirectly would mean.                                             17:57:16

21       Q    So it's my understanding that Mr. Musani had a                17:57:18

22  conversation with you about some of these numbers before                17:57:20

23  this was posted and made public.  Do you recall having a                17:57:24

24  conversation with Mr. Musani?                                           17:57:29

25       A    So it's very -- especially at this time                       17:57:31

 1  because we were doing a lot of evaluation.  It would be                 17:57:37

 2  very understandable for me to talk to Parvez to say,                    17:57:40

 3  here's our goals.  Here's what we're looking at.  Here's                17:57:47

 4  what Deloitte has identified.  You know, for him to                     17:57:52

 5  understand from a waste perspective what we think is an                 17:57:56

 6  opportunity.                                                            17:58:00

 7       Q    Okay.                                                         17:58:00

 8       A    So I would absolutely think that is probable.                 17:58:04

 9       Q    Okay.  So you're saying it's probable that you                17:58:07

10  had this conversation.  Do you remember having this                     17:58:11

11  conversation?                                                           17:58:13

12       A    I remember having lots of conversations with                  17:58:13

13  Parvez.                                                                 17:58:16

14       Q    Okay.                                                         17:58:16

15       A    The specifics of when I would have said                       17:58:17

16  something exactly that he would then, you know, come up                 17:58:19

17  with that number, I don't remember those specifics.  But                17:58:23

18  I have talked to Parvez across all of my years, and he                  17:58:25

19  is very aware of our objectives.                                        17:58:30

20       Q    Okay.  This 2 billion objective, is there some                17:58:33

21  place that that comes from?  You mentioned Deloitte.                    17:58:38

22  Does it come from one of the Deloitte studies?                          17:58:42

23       A    The waste study.                                              17:58:46

24       Q    Okay.  The waste study is the one that was                    17:58:48

25  done -- going back to my notes.  The waste study was the                17:58:51

 1  one that was statement work from December of 2016,                      17:58:59

 2  right?                                                                  17:59:04

 3       A    Correct, yes.                                                 17:59:05

 4       Q    And the result of that study, when did that --                17:59:06

 5  when was that prepared or what -- what was the document                 17:59:18

 6  that had this $2 billion number in it?                                  17:59:22

 7       A    It would have been three -- three months                      17:59:26

 8  later, four months later, sometime in --                                17:59:28

 9       Q    So early --                                                   17:59:31

10       A    Early first quarter.                                          17:59:32

11       Q    Of 20 --                                                      17:59:34

12       A    First quarter of 2017.                                        17:59:34

13       Q    Got it.                                                       17:59:36

14       A    Fiscal '18.                                                   17:59:37

15       Q    And is there a -- that was what you were --                   17:59:40

16  the information you were passing along to Mr. Musani in                 17:59:49

17  this conversation that you likely had with him in this                  17:59:53

18  time frame?                                                             17:59:58

19       A    Yes.                                                          17:59:59

20       Q    Any other source for that $2 billion number                   18:00:00

21  that you're aware of?                                                   18:00:04

22       A    Well, any other time he may have been exposed                 18:00:06

23  to it, we have flow meetings every two weeks where                      18:00:09

24  Parvez is typically a part of.  There -- I would have                   18:00:12

25  potentially reported that out to them.  There's other                   18:00:18

 1  times that he would have been exposed to that                           18:00:21

 2  information besides just a conversation with me                         18:00:25

 3  independently.                                                          18:00:28

 4       Q    Understood.  I guess I'm not asking what else                 18:00:37

 5  -- where else he may have gotten it.  I'm asking if it                  18:00:40

 6  came from you, are you saying that the source would have                18:00:43

 7  been Deloitte?                                                          18:00:47

 8       A    Yes.                                                          18:00:51

 9       Q    You wouldn't have had some other calculation                  18:00:52

10  that you had done or some other source for that sort of                 18:00:54

11  information?                                                            18:00:58

12       A    Most -- I -- I have no idea.  I mean, in any                  18:00:59

13  conversation am I calculating what waste, like, all food                18:01:02

14  waste, all fresh waste, like produce waste, like --                     18:01:07

15       Q    Understood.  But is there some other document                 18:01:12

16  where you have done your own calculation about                          18:01:14

17  eliminating waste $2 billion in five years?                             18:01:18

18       A    Not that I recall.                                            18:01:21

19       Q    Okay.  So that the place where we could find                  18:01:24

20  that number in the calculation would be the Deloitte                    18:01:28

21  work product from that waste study?                                     18:01:32

22       A    Yes.  It's an annual number.                                  18:01:36

23       Q    When you say it's an annual number, so in the                 18:01:46

24  Deloitte report, is it a per-year number that totals up                 18:01:49

25  to 2 billion?                                                           18:01:53
                                                         315



 1       A    It is a per year number that totals up to                     18:01:54

 2  whatever you multiply the number of years by.                           18:01:58

 3       Q    Okay.  Fair enough.  Did you do anything to                   18:02:04

 4  provide information about the $86 million number to                     18:02:08

 5  Mr. Musani?                                                             18:02:12

 6       A    Not to my knowledge.                                          18:02:13

 7       Q    You don't -- you're not aware of any                          18:02:15

 8  calculations about saving Eden being used in 43                         18:02:19

 9  distribution centers and has prevented 86 million in                    18:02:23

10  waste from happening?                                                   18:02:27

11       A    I don't know the specifics behind that.                       18:02:29

12       Q    Okay.  You don't believe that you provided                    18:02:32

13  that number to Mr. Musani?                                              18:02:35

14       A    No, no.                                                       18:02:37

15       Q    What's your budget for the projects that you                  18:02:51

16  oversee related to eliminating fresh food waste?                        18:02:57

17       A    What do you mean by budget?                                   18:03:08

18       Q    You have an organization that has a budget,                   18:03:10

19  correct?                                                                18:03:13

20       A    Yes, yes.                                                     18:03:13

21       Q    What's your total budget per year?                            18:03:14

22       A    What I'm going to spend?                                      18:03:17

23       Q    Yes.                                                          18:03:19

24       A    It's about $2 million.                                        18:03:19

25       Q    For your entire organization?                                 18:03:22

 1       A    Yep.                                                          18:03:23

 2       Q    And when you -- I -- you said what I'm going                  18:03:25

 3  to spend, so you made me believe that maybe there's some                18:03:30

 4  other way to calculate a budget besides what you're                     18:03:33

 5  going to spend.  Is that true?                                          18:03:37

 6       A    Well, I don't know what you were referring to.                18:03:38

 7       Q    Yeah.  I mean --                                              18:03:40

 8       A    Budget for a project, budget for capital,                     18:03:40

 9  budget for overhead, budget for --                                      18:03:43

10       Q    So let's start just with overall.  Your                       18:03:46

11  organization, I think, you said is 24 people.                           18:03:50

12       A    Yes.                                                          18:03:52

13       Q    And I assume that each fiscal year you have a                 18:03:53

14  budget for that organization?                                           18:03:56

15       A    That's correct.                                               18:03:59

16       Q    And is the $2 million number the budget for                   18:03:59

17  that entire organization?                                               18:04:04

18       A    It's a little over 2 million but yes.                         18:04:05

19       Q    Roughly.  And has it been about the same since                18:04:07

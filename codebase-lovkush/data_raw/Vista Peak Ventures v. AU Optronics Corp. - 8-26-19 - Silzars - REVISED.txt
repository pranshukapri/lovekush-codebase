 9                              EXAMINATION
10       BY MR. TICE:
11   Q   Good morning, Dr. Silzars.  My name is Jerry Tice, and I
12       represent the plaintiff in this matter.
13           Thank you for being here this morning.
14           Could you please introduce yourself for the Court?
15   A   Dr. Aris Silzars, A-R-I-S S-I-L-Z-A-R-S.
16   Q   Okay.  Do you know why you're here today?
17   A   My understanding is that you wish to pose some questions
18       regarding a declaration that I provided.
19   Q   Which declaration did you provide?
20   A   I believe this would be the one with regard to the '327
21       patent.
22   Q   Okay.  And do you understand that you're testifying under
23       oath today in the same manner that you would be in a
24       courtroom in front of a jury?
25   A   I do.
0006
 1   Q   Is there any reason why you cannot testify truthfully
 2       today?
 3   A   No.
 4   Q   Is there any reason why your testimony today might be
 5       unreliable?
 6   A   No.
 7   Q   I know you've been deposed a few times before, but I
 8       would like to go over a few ground rules to refresh your
 9       memory, if that's okay.
10   A   By the way, it might help-- would you mind moving just a
11       little closer?
12           Your voice is not that loud, and I--
13   Q   Okay.  Sure.
14   A   I don't want to lean forward too much, but just one notch
15       down would be really helpful.
16   Q   Not a problem.
17           All right.
18   A   My apologies.
19   Q   No, no.
20            All right.  Is this better?
21   A   Yes, much better.
22           Thank you.
23   Q   All right.  While we are talking today, let's try not to
24       talk over each other.  Please let me finish my question
25       before you begin answering, and I'll try to do the same
0007
 1       for you.
 2           Does that make sense?
 3   A   Yes.
 4   Q   And if you don't understand one of my questions, will you
 5       please let me know so I can rephrase the question in a
 6       way that you will understand?
 7   A   I will do that.
 8   Q   And do you understand that unless your attorney instructs
 9       you not to answer a question, that you must answer the
10       questions?
11   A   Yes.
12   Q   And lastly, we'll be having some breaks throughout the
13       day, but if you ever need a break, just let me know, and
14       we can stop.
15           I just ask that if there's a pending question,
16       please answer it before we take a break.
17           Does that make sense?
18   A   Yes.
19   Q   And you've been deposed before, correct?
20   A   That's correct.
21   Q   How many times have you been deposed?
22   A   Approximately 25 to 30.
23   Q   And were all of your depositions related to patent cases?
24   A   Almost all.
25   Q   Besides patent cases, what other depositions have you
0008
 1       been in?
 2   A   I'm sorry, could you repeat?
 3   Q   Outside of patent cases, what other types of cases have
 4       you been deposed in?
 5   A   There was one case that I can remember -- it's been quite
 6       a few years ago -- that was regarding a person who had
 7       left the company and had presumably taken some knowledge
 8       or intellectual property with them.
 9           It wasn't strictly related to patents.  Some of it
10       might have been proprietary technology.
11   Q   In the times that you've testified related to patent
12       cases, has that always been as an expert witness?
13   A   Yes.
14   Q   In your patent cases have you always testified on behalf
15       of the plaintiff or the defendant or a mix of the two?
16   A   It's been a mix.
17                                 (Exhibit No. 1 marked
18                                  for identification.)
19   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  The court reporter is going to hand you
20       Exhibit No. 1.
21           Do you recognize Exhibit No. 1?
22   A   I do.
23   Q   What is Exhibit No. 1?
24   A   It's a list of my depositions and/or trial testimony,
25       covering approximately a period of five years from
0009
 1       today's date.
 2   Q   Is Exhibit No. 1 an accurate listing of your depositions
 3       and trial testimony that you provided in the past five
 4       years?
 5   A   To the best of my understanding and knowledge, it is.
 6   Q   And is Exhibit No. 1 a complete listing of your
 7       depositions and trial testimony in the past five years?
 8   A   Yes.
 9   Q   Have you ever provided testimony at hearings?
10   A   What kind of hearings?
11   Q   Have you ever provided testimony at a hearing before the
12       Court?
13   A   Like a Markman hearing?
14           I am not sure what you mean by "hearing."
15           I have testified in court, so I'm not quite sure
16       what you mean by "hearing."
17   Q   Have you testified in a Markman hearing?
18   A   One time, yes.
19   Q   Have you testified at a trial?
20   A   Yes.
21   Q   I notice Exhibit No. 1 says, "Through June 2019."
22           Have you provided any testimony since June 2019?
23   A   No.
24   Q   Has your testimony ever been struck?
25   A   No, actually, let me correct that.
0010
 1   Q   Okay.
 2   A   There's one-- I was going to say there's one thing
 3       missing.
 4           It's on the back side.
 5   Q   Okay.
 6   A   With what's on the back side, then it's up to date.
 7   Q   Has any of your testimony been struck by a Court?
 8                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 9                         THE WITNESS:  No.
10   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Have any of your opinions been struck by a
11       Court?
12   A   No.
13   Q   And you provided a report in this case, right?
14   A   I provided a declaration with regard to the '327.
15                                 (Exhibit No. 2 marked
16                                  for identification.)
17   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  The court reporter is handing you Exhibit
18       No. 2.
19           Is this the declaration that you were referencing?
20   A   Yes, it is.
21   Q   And in this declaration you opine that a phrase of the
22       '327 patent is indefinite; is that correct?
23   A   That's correct.
24   Q   And which phrase is that?
25   A   It is, in general, relating to the last portion of the
0011
 1       claim, which is claim one of the '327 patent, and it is
 2       the phrase in its entirety that says wherein, "A center
 3       of a top of the columnar spacer is shifted from above a
 4       widthwise center of the gate line toward above the common
 5       line, and the top of the columnar spacer partially
 6       overruns from above the gate line toward above the common
 7       line when viewed from the above," the top being directed
 8       to the first substrate.
 9   Q   I know it is a long phrase.
10           Do you agree that we can refer to this long phrase
11       as "the shifting phrase" throughout the day?
12   A   If you'd like, sure.
13   Q   And in your declaration do you offer an opinion on any
14       other claim terms or phrases, other than the shifting
15       phrase?
16   A   My opinion was only about claim one, and I've reviewed
17       the rest of claim one, so I suppose in that context my
18       opinion is that I understand the rest of claim one, but
19       the part that is indefinite is the critical part of the
20       claim, which is this last phrase.
21   Q   Okay.  Outside of this shifting phrase, are you offering
22       an opinion that any other terms should be construed by
23       the Court?
24   A   Within this claim?
25   Q   Within any claim in this case.
0012
 1   A   Of the '327 patent?
 2   Q   Okay.
 3   A   Of the '327 patent, I don't believe so.
 4           I think my testimony and observations are with
 5       regard to what you're calling the shifting phrase.
 6   Q   And in your declaration are you offering any opinions
 7       related to any patents other than the '327 patent?
 8   A   In this declaration, no.
 9   Q   And we've been discussing the '327 patent recently.
10           Is that U.S. Patent No. 7,046,327?
11   A   I'm sorry, I didn't hear the first part of your question.
12       You were looking down at your-- could you please repeat?
13   Q   Sure.
14           I said, "We've been discussing the '327 patent.  Is
15       that U.S. Patent No. 7,046,327?"
16   A   I am sure it is, but I think we need to-- yes, 7,046,327.
17           I think you will appreciate that I haven't memorized
18       all the numbers in all cases.
19   Q   And when I say "'327 patent," you understand that this is
20       the patent I'm referring to, Patent No. 7,046,327?
21   A   I do.
22   Q   Does Exhibit No. 2 contain a complete statement of all of
23       the opinions that you're offering?
24   A   There may be clarifications that we want to provide to
25       the opinions that are in my declaration, but the
0013
 1       conclusion is the same.
 2   Q   Does Exhibit No. 2 contain the complete basis and reasons
 3       for each of your opinions?
 4   A   I think there are additional reasons that we may want to
 5       discuss during this deposition.
 6           I think the essence is what is here, but, as I said,
 7       there may be some additional clarification, additional
 8       explanation that would give a stronger basis for my
 9       conclusion.
10   Q   What additional reasons may you want to discuss today?
11   A   As I have reviewed this claim one, this particular
12       phrase, and also reviewed the specification, and then
13       tried to relate what the claim says to the
14       specification-- and the patent particularly calls out
15       that the claims are intended to be broader and that the
16       claims are what is really the inventive feature, not just
17       what's in the embodiments described in the patent.
18           In that context, if I read this claim in its
19       broadest view, then it basically says to me that as
20       written, any columnar spacing that is positioned anywhere
21       other than precisely over the center line of the gate,
22       that one could claim infringement.
23   Q   So is it your opinion that if there is a columnar spacer
24       that is not placed precisely over the center line of the
25       gate, that that would practice the claim?
0014
 1                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 2                         THE WITNESS:  I specifically said-- I
 3       think you said "the gate."
 4           It's the gate-- the gate line, because the columnar
 5       spacing is not over the gate electrode.  It's over the
 6       gate line.
 7           So yes, as I read this claim and how it very
 8       reasonably could be interpreted, is that any columnar
 9       spacing that is in any position, other than precisely
10       over the center point of the-- let's use the term here,
11       "of the gate line," that's in the claim here, if it's not
12       precisely over the center of the gate line, then it would
13       be, one could claim, infringement of this patent.
14   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  And in your previous response you said,
15       "One could reasonably interpret the claim in that way."
16           Is that how you interpret the claim?
17   A   Yes, I can interpret the claim to be that broad.
18   Q   And included in Exhibit No. 2 is your CV, correct?
19   A   Yes, I believe so.
20           Let me check.
21           Yes, it is.
22   Q   If you turn to the last page of your CV, it mentions that
23       you have over 100 publications.
24           Do you see that?
25   A   Yes.
0015
 1   Q   It says that that list is available upon request,
 2       correct?
 3   A   Yes.
 4   Q   Have you provided that list in relation to this case?
 5   A   Not in relation to this case, no.
 6   Q   Do you keep an accurate and complete listing of these
 7       publications?
 8   A   It's become more difficult to do that now with putting
 9       publications basically online.  It becomes a little bit
10       more questionable exactly what is considered a
11       publication.
12           Most of the listing that I have would be
13       publications that were in technical journals, that were
14       in recognized magazines that one could pick up and read.
15           Over the last few years that's become a little
16       harder to keep track of because for a number of years I
17       have written a monthly column, and for about a period of
18       ten years it appeared in Information Display magazine,
19       which was a publication that was printed.
20           In about the mid '90s, that-- my column went online,
21       and I have not kept track of every one of those, although
22       I do have some listing of what I've published.
23           In today's world, it becomes difficult to say what
24       is a publication.
25           In many cases journals are now just putting things
0016
 1       online, and so the traditional concept of what
 2       constituted a publication has changed, so I've gone with
 3       that trend, but I can't tell you that I've kept an
 4       accurate record of everything that I've put out for
 5       people to view or read or access.
 6   Q   Okay.  So you may not-- your list may not have all of
 7       your publications, depending on how you define
 8       "publication," but you do keep a list; is that correct?
 9   A   I've kept a list of everything that's shown up in print.
10           For example, the columns that I wrote that were
11       printed in Information Display magazine, those I have a
12       listing of.
13           The others I have basically on my computer and a
14       folder that contains all the postings that I put up
15       online.
16   Q   Why do you keep this list?
17   A   Well, in the earlier times, when things were printed, it
18       was more appropriate for-- you know, to have a list of
19       publications, especially for people that are in academia.
20           They will generally provide a list of everything
21       they've ever published, everything that they've put on--
22       somewhere because, to some extent, that affects their
23       status in academia.
24           I have not been in academia, but I've been very
25       involved in the Society for Information Display,
0017
 1       international society.  We have academics, we have people
 2       from industry, so it's a list-- like I said, I haven't
 3       kept it with great diligence over the last few years.
 4           I kept it with more diligence earlier in my career.
 5   Q   Have you provided this list to anyone in relation to this
 6       case?
 7   A   In regard to this case?  No, I have not been asked to do
 8       that and I have not done that.
 9   Q   If your counsel were to ask you, would you be able to
10       provide that list to them?
11   A   Yes.
12   Q   Are any of the publications in your list related to LCD
13       displays?
14   A   In a general sense, sure, yes.
15   Q   Did any of your publications discuss spacers in LCD
16       displays?
17   A   Not specifically.
18   Q   What is a spacer?
19                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
20                         THE WITNESS:  In the context of a
21       liquid crystal display, which I think is what we want to
22       talk about today, the liquid crystal material is placed
23       between two substrates, typically glass, and the spacing
24       between those two substrates has to be maintained very
25       precisely.
0018
 1           The liquid crystal molecules basically respond to an
 2       electric field, and it's important that the response be
 3       the same over the entire area of the display, so whether
 4       it's a laptop computer or a cell phone or a television
 5       set, this-- to maintain uniformity of the image, we have
 6       to have very strict uniformity of the spacing between the
 7       top and bottom substrates.
 8           For many years the spacing was accomplished with
 9       little spheres, so basically-- it is actually correct to
10       say that basically these little spheres were put down
11       like from a salt shaker.  They were randomly placed.
12           So the little spheres would simply scatter, and they
13       cover perhaps less than one percent of the area, but they
14       were precise little glass or plastic balls precisely
15       dimensioned, typically in the range of three to five
16       microns, and that provided that uniformity of spacing.
17           More recently, over probably about the last ten
18       years, these little round spacers have been replaced by
19       little columns that set the spacing, and they're
20       typically hidden behind the black matrix.
21           The column, the spacing, is very important and very
22       crucial to the operation of the display because it has to
23       be very tightly controlled.
24   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  What do you mean by "very tightly
25       controlled"?
0019
 1   A   It has to be controlled to a fraction of a micron.
 2           The total height of the column, the spacer, is, as I
 3       said, typically in the range of three to five microns.
 4           That is the thickness of the liquid crystal layer.
 5           That spacing has to be controlled to a small
 6       fraction of that spacing, which would be a fraction of a
 7       micron.
 8   Q   So do I understand correctly, when you say "controlled,"
 9       do you mean-- you're referring to controlling of the
10       height of the spacer?
11   A   Yes.
12           What we have to control is the distance between the
13       top and the bottom substrate, and so we control that by
14       the size of the spacer or the height of the spacer.
15   Q   Did any of your publications that you authored discuss a
16       common line?
17                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
18                         WITNESS:  Common line is really
19       ubiquitous to liquid crystal displays.
20           When you're talking about a liquid crystal display,
21       inherently you would be talking about a common line or a
22       common electrode, depending on the kind of liquid crystal
23       display it is.
24   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  In this context of liquid crystal
25       displays, what is a common line?
0020
 1                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 2                         THE WITNESS:  A common line would be
 3       the-- we could call it-- I think a term that is actually
 4       quite good to use is a "wiring."
 5           It is a connection that goes to all of the common
 6       electrodes.
 7           I think the important distinction-- the same way we
 8       distinguish between gate electrode and gate line, so the
 9       only way we can access this total area is by running
10       basically thin metallic conductors.
11           The thin metallic conductors are called the lines,
12       and then the actual electrodes are distinguished from the
13       wiring from the lines.
14   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  How are the electrodes distinguished from
15       the wiring?
16                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
17                         MR. TICE:  What's the objection?
18                         MR. APREOTESI:  The context is vague
19       and not tied to any patents.
20                         THE WITNESS:  Again, since I mentioned
21       both gate lines and common lines, we can talk about both
22       because they both have this distinction.
23           A gate line provides the actual wiring.  It goes out
24       to the edge and it contacts to an external voltage.
25           Then under the thin film transistor, we have the
0021
 1       gate electrode, and so the gate electrode is
 2       distinguished from the gate line because the electrode is
 3       what now acts to function as the gate for the transistor.
 4           In the same sense, a common line is the wiring that
 5       now goes to all of the pixel electrodes that function to
 6       modify the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules,
 7       so the distinction is that the common line would not be
 8       influencing the orientation of the liquid crystals.  It
 9       is simply the wiring.
10           The common electrode would be what is influencing
11       the orientation of the liquid crystal in conjunction with
12       another electrode.
13   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Did any of your publications discuss
14       common electrodes?
15   A   Again, it would be in the context of talking about liquid
16       crystal displays.
17           Even if you're doing a-- I've done a number of
18       presentations, and when you put up, for example, a TFT
19       structure or put up how the pixels are constructed, that
20       inherently requires a discussion because you have a photo
21       in front that says-- that shows these common lines and
22       gate electrodes, so in that general sense, but when you
23       ask a very narrow question, have I written a publication
24       that says something about common lines, no.
25           I don't think such would even exist by anybody.
0022
 1   Q   I believe earlier you said that the term "common
 2       electrode" is ubiquitous in the LCD display field.
 3           Is that also true for the term "common electrode"?
 4                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 5                         THE WITNESS:  Again, in the context of
 6       understanding that common electrode is not the same as a
 7       common line, sure, that would be pretty much understood.
 8                                 (Exhibit No. 3 marked
 9                                  for identification.)
10   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  The court reporter just handed you Exhibit
11       No. 3.
12           Have you seen Exhibit No. 3 before?
13   A   Yes.
14   Q   What is Exhibit No. 3?
15   A   Exhibit No. 3 is the patent, 7,046,327.
16   Q   And I believe we agreed earlier that we could refer to
17       Exhibit No. 3 as the '327 patent.
18           Do you understand that?
19   A   Yes.
20   Q   When is the first time that you became aware of the '327
21       patent?
22   A   You mean with regard to this case?
23   Q   Sure, we can start with that.
24           In regards to this case, when is the first time that
25       you became aware of the '327 patent?
0023
 1   A   I had not seen the '327 patent prior to my work on this
 2       case.
 3   Q   Okay.  And when did you first become aware of the '327
 4       patent?
 5   A   A few months ago.
 6           I wouldn't be able to give you a precise date.
 7   Q   Okay.  What circumstances led to your awareness of the
 8       '327 patent?
 9   A   I was asked to review it by the attorneys from Vinson &
10       Elkins.
11   Q   When were you first contacted regarding this case?
12   A   It's been several months, but I don't have a-- I can't
13       even give you an approximate date at the moment.
14   Q   Within the last several months; is that fair?
15   A   Something on the order of several months, yes.
16   Q   Who first contacted you regarding this case?
17   A   I think it was Mr. Craig Tyler.
18   Q   Did you sign an engagement agreement or retainer
19       agreement in relation to this case?
20   A   I believe I did.
21   Q   Who did you enter into the agreement with?
22   A   It would be with Vinson & Elkins.
23   Q   And was this also in the last several months, the same
24       timeframe?
25   A   Sure, about the same timeframe.
0024
 1   Q   Have you been asked to provide any other opinions in this
 2       case?
 3                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 4                         THE WITNESS:  This is the only
 5       declaration, only written opinion that I've provided so
 6       far.
 7   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Do you expect to provide other written
 8       opinions?
 9                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
10                         THE WITNESS:  If I'm asked to do that,
11       yes, I would do that.
12   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Have you been asked to do that?
13   A   Not at this time.
14   Q   When did you begin forming your opinions that you set
15       forth in the declaration we're discussing today, Exhibit
16       No. 2?
17   A   Perhaps in July.
18           The declaration is dated August 8th.
19            I think I probably worked on it sometime in July.
20   Q   Did you form the opinions in Exhibit No. 2 on your own?
21                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
22                         THE WITNESS:  In terms of expert
23       opinions, in general, they're my opinions.
24           I certainly had discussions with attorneys, but I
25       see my task, my role as an expert witness to provide
0025
 1       technically accurate information.
 2   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Before you formed your opinion that the
 3       shifting phrase is indefinite, did someone else tell you
 4       that that phrase might be indefinite or did you bring
 5       that to someone's attention?
 6   A   Actually, what happened was that--
 7                         MR. APREOTESI:  Aris, one second.
 8           To the extent this involves attorney-client
 9       communications, please don't divulge attorney-client
10       communications.
11           To the extent you can answer the question without
12       revealing attorney-client communications, go ahead.
13                         THE WITNESS:  I can do that.
14           After I read the patent and studied it, read the
15       specific embodiments and then read the claim, I came to
16       the conclusion that I could not understand this last
17       phrase that we're calling the shifting phrase.
18           I read it over and over again and said, "I cannot
19       figure out what this means."
20           If I read it as it's written, it's so broad as to
21       encompass essentially everything.
22           The opinion was really mine that I could not unravel
23       this last phrase, and I couldn't understand some of the
24       combinations, like "toward" and "above" with nothing
25       in-between.
0026
 1           "Toward above," what does that mean?
 2           I could not understand what it meant.
 3           We can go through some of the other things.  I can
 4       explain to you what was creating confusion, but that was
 5       basically the starting point.
 6   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Were you unable to understand the phrase
 7       because it was too broad?
 8                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 9                         THE WITNESS:  Both too broad and also
10       the combination of words made it, for me-- I could not
11       unravel words "toward above" with nothing in-between.
12           Maybe if it said "toward and above," then I could
13       say kind of what it means.
14           Again, it says, "Partially overruns from above the
15       gate line."
16           What does "partially overruns from above"-- what
17       does that mean?
18           It was not making sense to me as the claim was
19       written.
20           Now, if we go to the specification and look at a
21       particular embodiment, okay, then I can understand that
22       embodiment, but I could not understand the wording of the
23       claim, and I could not relate the wording of the claim to
24       the embodiment.
25   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Who drafted your declaration?
0027
 1   A   I'm sorry?
 2   Q   Who drafted your declaration?
 3   A   Did I what?
 4   Q   Who drafted your declaration?
 5   A   I'm sorry.
 6   Q   That's okay.
 7   A   Certain parts of it were drafted by attorneys, which are
 8       the summary of the law.  I did not do that part.
 9           I did write the introduction, I wrote the
10       qualifications, I wrote the section on person of ordinary
11       skill in the art, that was my input, and I wrote the
12       background of the technology, and I wrote the overview,
13       and then the final conclusions I provided a draft, and I
14       think there was some refinement of the wording that was
15       provided, but it's essentially my work, except for that--
16       the part about what is the law.
17   Q   Prior to submitting your declaration, how many hours
18       would you estimate that you reviewed the '327 patent?
19   A   It extended over a period of a week or two, and then
20       in-between there were discussions with attorneys, so in
21       total, perhaps a couple of days worth, but not two days
22       in sequence.
23            Perhaps 16 hours over a period of several weeks.
24   Q   Did you review any other patents related to this case?
25   A   Yes, I have.
0028
 1   Q   Which other patents did you review?
 2   A   I don't have the list with me.
 3           There are-- at the moment there are nine patents
 4       that I've been asked to review but not to provide any
 5       expert report on at this time.
 6   Q   Did you do anything to prepare for this deposition?
 7   A   Certainly I reviewed my declaration.
 8           I reviewed Dr. Hatalis's declaration with regard to
 9       the '327, and I looked at the patent again and had a
10       brief 45-minute meeting yesterday afternoon with
11       Mr. Apreotesi.
12   Q   Other than your brief meeting with Counsel, did you have
13       any other meetings to prepare for this deposition?
14   A   No.
15   Q   Outside of discussions with your counsel, have you
16       discussed this case with any other people?
17   A   No.
18   Q   You mentioned that you reviewed Dr. Hatalis's
19       declaration.
20           After reviewing his report, did any of your opinions
21       change?
22   A   No.
23   Q   What are your views on Dr. Hatalis's declaration?
24   A   With regard to the '327, my view is that he used one
25       particular embodiment to explain the meaning of the
0029
 1       claim, whereas my view is based on what the patent
 2       states, that the claim should be viewed much more broadly
 3       than that one specific embodiment.
 4   Q   Should you read the claim in light of the specification?
 5   A   At some point I did, yes.  I went back and looked at the
 6       specifications and said, "Now, with regard to this
 7       particular embodiment, can I read that particular
 8       embodiment onto the claim," and certainly that particular
 9       embodiment is encompassed within the claim, but the claim
10       is much broader than that in its wording.
11   Q   Have you ever met Dr. Hatalis?
12   A   I don't believe so.
13           I may have seen him at a-- I looked over his resume,
14       and he's certainly been in display activities for many
15       years.
16           Some of the events are common, but I'm-- we haven't
17       actually met face-to-face and shaken hands with each
18       other.
19   Q   And before you reviewed his declaration, were you
20       familiar with Dr. Hatalis?
21   A   Not until I reviewed his resume, and then I could see
22       that there were some common times when we might have been
23       doing somewhat similar activities but maybe not directly
24       with each other.

 1                                 (Exhibit No. 4 marked
 2                                  for identification.)
 3   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  The court reporter just handed you Exhibit
 4       No. 4.
 5           Do you recognize this document?
 6   A   I believe this is the last page of the protective order.
 7           I recognize signing it and filling it out.
 8           That's my handwriting.
 9           As far as context, I think it was part of the
10       protective order.
11   Q   Why did you sign the protective order in this case?
12                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
13                         THE WITNESS:  I was asked to do so.
14   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  In forming your opinions, did you review
15       any confidential documents in this case?
16   A   I have-- in terms of forming my opinion for this
17       particular declaration, I did not.
18           In a more general answer, I have reviewed documents
19       which I believe might be considered confidential.
20   Q   Are you aware of what products are accused in this case?
21   A   Again, in a general sense I have been sent and reviewed
22       infringement contentions, and I believe within those
23       infringement contentions there were products that were
24       listed.
25           As I recall, the list was quite long.
0031
 1   Q   Can you explain to me the steps you took to form your
 2       opinion that the shifting phrase of the '327 patent is
 3       indefinite?
 4   A   I partially explained that already, but just to-- again,
 5       just to give you maybe a more complete story, certainly
 6       my starting point was reviewing the '327 patent and
 7       reviewing the-- you know, the claim one, which I was led
 8       to understand was the claim that was at issue.
 9           Again, I reviewed the patent, I reviewed the
10       specific embodiments that were listed in the patent, I
11       reviewed the patent language as to what it meant in terms
12       of what the claim one states, and in particular, when I
13       started seeing the confusion, that I couldn't quite
14       understand this last phrase, I went back and read this
15       phrase.
16           It says, toward the end, "On the contrary, it is
17       intended for this subject matter of the invention to
18       include all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents
19       as can be included within the spirit and scope of the
20       following claims," so I said, "Okay, what the patent says
21       is I need to read the claim carefully and not assume that
22       the embodiments that are described are the only things
23       that are claimed."
24           The embodiments were somewhat helpful in trying to
25       understand this last phrase, but not entirely.
0032
 1           I said, "Well, I understand what the embodiment
 2       shows, but how do I read this in the context of this last
 3       phrase?"  And I could not.
 4           I could not interpret this last phrase, other than
 5       to come to this conclusion:  This can encompass
 6       everything.
 7           It doesn't define which common line.  It doesn't
 8       define how much we move.
 9           It doesn't really define which direction we move.
10           The only thing I can get out of this is that it has
11       to be over the center line of the gate line precisely,
12       and that's what led me to discussion and feedback to say,
13       "I'm lost.  I cannot make this last claim term work."
14           That, I think, was the beginning of saying, "Well,
15       it's indefinite.  You cannot figure it out."
16   Q   Can you not figure it out because it's too broad?
17                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; vague.
18                         THE WITNESS:  It's both too broad and
19       also the terms are not-- it's not possible to really
20       interpret them, at least in terms of what the-- the one
21       embodiment it refers to.
22           It says that it's a common line, but it doesn't
23       define which one.
24           There are many common lines within the display, so
25       as this is read now, I can point to any of those common
0033
 1       lines and say, "Well, I'm going to shift toward that
 2       common line, and it could be above or below," so I could
 3       shift both ways.
 4           Then this phrase of "toward above," I do-- those two
 5       words stuck together I have never encountered in the
 6       English language, so without an "and" or something, "or,"
 7       or something, in-between-- so that's just confusing
 8       from-- I don't know how to interpret those words stuck
 9       together.
10           Then the other was this "partially."
11           "We have to space partially overrun from above"--
12       how do I partially overrun from above?
13           I cannot interpret that phrase in any common sense
14       way, again without using an embodiment, which is supposed
15       to be limiting.
16           And "partially," how much is partially?  Is it still
17       over the gate?  Should it now be over the common?
18           There are just a myriad of confusing terms in here
19       that when you try to put them all together, it just
20       doesn't work.
21   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Earlier you said there are many common
22       lines within the display.
23           What display were you referring to?
24   A   It would be-- in this case it would be any display that
25       uses the-- basically the common lines on the lower
0034
 1       substrate.
 2   Q   Is there any particular display you are thinking of when
 3       you say that?
 4   A   I am distinguishing that from what would be really
 5       probably the most common, in terms of number of products,
 6       would be vertically aligned.
 7           On a vertically aligned display, the common
 8       electrode or the common surface is on the top, on the top
 9       surface.
10           In the embodiments that are described in the '327
11       patent, the common line and the common electrodes are on
12       the bottom surface.
13           That's my understanding of this patent.
14   Q   Does claim one of the '327 patent require that the common
15       electrode and common lines be on the bottom substrate?
16   A   To the extent that it says that we need a common line
17       parallel to the gate line, I would-- that would tend to
18       imply that it's on the same substrate.
19           Also, on a vertically aligned display where you have
20       a common electrode on the top surface, the only common
21       line might be way out at the edge, so there would not
22       necessarily be anything you can identify as a common
23       line.  It's a uniform conductive surface, which is
24       typically ITO.
25           So on displays that do not have the electrode on the
0035
 1       bottom substrate, the common electrode, I think you would
 2       most likely not be able to find anything that you can
 3       point to as a common line.
 4           They might use them just to enhance the
 5       conductivity, but it wouldn't be as clear as-- for what I
 6       believe is the intent of this patent.
 7           Now, on the other hand, if we can find a display
 8       where there are common lines that are parallel to gate
 9       lines, but they're on the top surface, then it may-- this
10       claim may fit that kind of a display, just based on
11       that-- just based on that narrow term.
12   Q   Outside of your review of the '327 patent, did you rely
13       on any additional facts in forming your opinion that the
14       shifting phrase is indefinite?
15   A   No.  I tried to read it in the context of the
16       specification and in the context of what the patent says
17       it wanted claim one to represent, so no, I did not look
18       at other specific references.
19           I, over time, have analyzed a lot of products and
20       taken photos of spacers and where they are and how
21       they're located, but I did not have to-- that's my
22       background.  I did not specifically go back and do that,
23       other than-- actually, I looked at some photos of saying,
24       "Where are spacers," and they tend to be kind of all over
25       the place.
0036
 1   Q   Outside of the '327 patent, did you rely on any other
 2       documents to help inform your opinion?
 3   A   As I just mentioned, I did go-- I've done teardowns of
 4       literally hundreds of displays, and I have a photo file
 5       of the structures.  I have-- down to what's on the top
 6       substrate, what's on the bottom substrate, so I did go
 7       back and look at some of my photos and said, "Well, where
 8       are the spacers in all these other products that I've
 9       looked at," and that was helpful, again, in terms of
10       trying to interpret this phrase in claim one.
11   Q   Did you review the file history of the '327 patent?
12   A   No, I did not.
13   Q   We've been going about an hour.
14           Is it a good time for a break?
15   A   It's up to you.
16           I am good for however long you want to go.
17                          MR. TICE:  Let's take a quick break.
18                         VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  We are
19       going off the record.  The time is 8:53.
20                                   (Recess 8:53 to 9:04 a.m.)
21                         VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We are back on
22       the record.  The time is 9:04.
23   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Welcome back, Dr. Silzars.
24           Do you understand you are still under oath?
25   A   I do.
0037
 1   Q   As we were discussing earlier, after you reviewed the
 2       '327 patent, you determined that the shifting phrase is
 3       indefinite; is that correct?
 4   A   That is the-- I think the legal term.
 5           As I was describing earlier, I found it-- I couldn't
 6       understand it.  I couldn't unravel it.
 7           The words were confusing.  I couldn't apply them,
 8       and so that was-- you know, my term would be "I can't
 9       figure out what it's saying."
10           That would be the informal term.
11           I think the legal term is that that makes it
12       indefinite because it's impossible to apply it in a
13       consistent way or in an understandable way.
14   Q   Are you familiar with the case "Advanced Technology
15       Incubator versus Sharp Corporation, et al."?
16   A   What was the first one, Advanced--
17   Q   Advanced Technology Incubator.
18   A   No, I don't believe so.
19   Q   Did you ever provide testimony in that case?
20   A   I provided testimony on behalf of Sharp in other cases,
21       but I don't recognize the "Advanced Technology
22       Incubators."
23           That may be-- is that a company that's down in the
24       Austin, Texas area?  It's a small outfit?
25           There are something that's similar-- maybe with a
0038
 1       similar name that involved a guy by the name of Zivi
 2       Yaniv.
 3           If that's what I'm thinking of, that's many years
 4       ago.
 5                                 (Exhibit No. 5 marked
 6                                  for identification.)
 7   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  The court reporter is handing you Exhibit
 8       No. 5.
 9           There is a case heading on the top of that exhibit.
10           Does that refresh your recollection?
11   A   I see this is dated March 2010, so it's almost ten years
12       ago.
13           My recollection is that this case settled like
14       during-- just before jury selection or something.
15           I vaguely remember being down in Texas for a trial,
16       and then the trial never took place.
17           However it was, it got resolved.
18           I do not remember, in any way, being told that I was
19       not going to be able to testify or that I was being
20       excluded from the trial, but I was there.
21           I was there preparing to testify.
22           I don't recall seeing this order.
23   Q   Do you recall offering opinions on definiteness in
24       relation to this case, and by "this case," I mean the
25       Advanced Technology Incubator case of-- that's shown in
0039
 1       Exhibit No. 5?
 2   A   I think I just told you about everything I recall about
 3       the case, was that I do not remember even what the
 4       patents were that were at issue, and, as I said, I
 5       remember being on-site ready to go to trial, and then the
 6       trial didn't happen.  I had to come home.
 7           I have absolutely no recollection-- I have to-- I
 8       guess to put it in context, I have my own laboratory and
 9       I do product evaluations and I do product teardowns, and
10       I literally sometimes get somebody asking me to look at
11       100 patents to see if any of them could be used in an
12       infringement case, and sometimes I'll look at products.
13           The number of patents I look at, the number of
14       clients-- and I tend not to retain everything that I've
15       ever done, so this one, I've told you everything I
16       remember about it.
17   Q   Please turn to Page 12 of Exhibit No. 5.
18   A   Okay.
19   Q   Do you recall offering opinions on definiteness in this
20       Advanced Technology matter?
21   A   I clearly do not recall any of my testimony or any of the
22       opinions I offered.
23           I can try to read for you what is here, but I don't
24       have any recollection of the specifics of this case.
25   Q   Please look over one page to 13.
0040
 1           There's-- that first full paragraph, the first
 2       sentence says, "While experts are permitted to testify
 3       regarding their knowledge of a person of ordinary skill
 4       in the art," and there's a cite, and it says, "These
 5       experts are not permitted to testify as to ultimate legal
 6       conclusions."
 7           Do you recall that on that basis the Court excluded
 8       your testimony regarding some definiteness issues?
 9   A   First of all, I don't recall that the Court excluded any
10       testimony, so I simply have no recollection of having
11       testimony that was excluded.
12           I certainly understand what would be considered
13       "ultimate legal conclusions."
14           However, as an expert I believe I can explain
15       whether something is understandable or not.
16   Q   What is your understanding of "ultimate legal
17       conclusion"?
18   A   My understanding of that is that would be something on
19       which the Court would rule, that the Court would-- in the
20       same way that-- in claim construction, that a Court rules
21       what a claim term is going to mean.
22           When the Court makes that ruling, then I see that as
23       a legal conclusion.
24           The claim term interpretation that I may offer or an
25       opposing expert may offer is not a legal conclusion.
0041
 1       It's an opinion, so the legal conclusion is what the
 2       Court finally decides.
 3           I think in the context of the '327, I'm offering a
 4       technical opinion.  I'm offering an explanation of why I
 5       believe that claim term is not understandable, but the
 6       legal conclusion will, of course, have to come from the
 7       Court for whether that claim term is indefinite or not.
 8   Q   I am reading from the last paragraph on Page 13, and it
 9       says, "Accordingly, Dr. Silzars's and Kanicki's opinions
10       on the ultimate issue of definiteness are struck."
11           Do you understand why the Court made that statement?
12   A   No.
13   Q   Are you offering, in this case we are here to discuss
14       today, an opinion that the shifting phrase is indefinite?
15   A   I am offering an opinion of why I believe that phrase is
16       not understandable, so if we want to use the term
17       "indefinite" in an English language context, I believe
18       it's indefinite.
19           Am I offering a legal opinion that it's indefinite?
20       No.  I believe that's for the Court to decide.
21           "Indefinite" is not a strictly legal term.  It is a
22       term that you and I can understand as a common usage, so
23       I'm offering an opinion that I do not understand what
24       that claim says, and in that case I believe it's
25       appropriate to use the term that it's indefinite.
0042
 1           It's simply-- it's impossible to interpret the claim
 2       in an understandable way that could be applied to a
 3       specific potentially infringing product.
 4   Q   Is it your opinion that your conclusion that the term is
 5       indefinite is a proper opinion to provide to the Court?
 6                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 7                         THE WITNESS:  I think it's proper in
 8       the sense that, as I just described, I am using the term
 9       as an English language term, not as a legal term.
10           As I said, just like with claim construction, I can
11       propose a claim construction, but the Court has to
12       finally decide whether that's going to be accepted or
13       not.
14           In this context, it's the same approach, that I am
15       offering a technical opinion using a common language term
16       and not implying that it has legal weight in terms of
17       being used later on in the case.
18   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Do you have Exhibit No. 3 in front of you,
19       your declaration?
20   A   I did not have it in front of me.
21           Now I do.
22   Q   And that's Exhibit No. 2, right?
23   A   Yes.
24   Q   How many pages is your declaration, Exhibit No. 2?
25   A   Now counting my resume, it looks like it's 13 pages.
0043
 1           That's the number at the bottom of the last page.
 2   Q   In the last section of the report is Section No. 8
 3       entitled, "The '327 patent is indefinite under 35 U.S.C.
 4       Section 112."
 5           Do you see that section?
 6   A   Yes.
 7   Q   What page does that begin on?
 8   A   Well, that title, I am not, again, an expert in the
 9       patent law, so that-- under "35 U.S.C. 112," that was
10       provided by the attorneys.
11   Q   My question was:
12           What page does that section begin on?
13   A   Oh, it's Page 11.  I'm sorry.
14   Q   And then I am going to refer you to Paragraph No. 42 on
15       Page 11 where you opine that "This shifting phrase is
16       indefinite because one of ordinary skill in the art would
17       not know what direction to shift the columnar spacer,
18       whether one would shift toward or shift above the common
19       line."
20           Do you see that?
21   A   Yes.
22   Q   Do you still hold that opinion?
23   A   That's part of the confusion, yes.
24           That's not the entire opinion.
25           That's with regard to that specific phrase-- or
0044
 1       portion of that specific phrase.
 2   Q   And in Paragraph No. 43 you state that "One of ordinary
 3       skill in the art would understand that there are several
 4       common lines in an LCD panel."
 5           Do you see that?
 6   A   Yes.
 7   Q   Is it your opinion that the shifting term is indefinite,
 8       at least in part, because an LCD panel has several common
 9       lines?
10   A   Yes.
11   Q   Besides these two reasons that we just discussed in
12       Paragraph No. 42 and 43, does your report identify any
13       other reasons why the shifting phrase is indefinite?
14   A   I have tried to explain in further detail, in my earlier
15       testimony, giving you examples from the phrase that were
16       perhaps-- in addition to what's described here.
17   Q   Are you able to point to any other portions of your
18       report that have any additional reasons why the shifting
19       phrase is indefinite?
20   A   I think we can go through Paragraph No. 44 that has some
21       additional comments about why that's confusing.
22           I think further on in Paragraph No. 45 I mention
23       that it's shifted from above the center of the gate line,
24       that it has to somehow be related to the center of this
25       gate line, and that the only identification we could make
0045
 1       there would be that unless the spacer is precisely
 2       positioned over the center of the gate line, that it
 3       would be-- someone could claim that it infringes.
 4   Q   When you say "someone could claim that it infringes," is
 5       it your opinion that a spacer placed in that way that you
 6       just mentioned would satisfy the claim elements unless it
 7       was directly above the center of the gate line?
 8                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 9                         THE WITNESS:  What my testimony was,
10       is that based on the reading of the claim, the only
11       noninfringing product, potentially, would be where the
12       spacer is precisely over the center of the gate line,
13       because we do not know the direction, we do not know the
14       magnitude, from the claim, that anything other than a
15       spacer position precisely over the center of the gate
16       line could be claimed to infringe.
17   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Would it infringe?
18   A   Would it?
19   Q   In your last answer you said, "we do not know the
20       magnitude from the claim that anything other than a
21       spacer situation precisely over the center of the gate
22       line could be claimed to infringe," and my question is:
23           Anything can be claimed to be infringed, but I want
24       to know, would it be infringed?
25   A   I think there would be a reasonable argument that it does
0046
 1       infringe, and so from the reading of the claim, I don't
 2       want to take the position that I'm claiming infringement
 3       personally.
 4           I am saying that the possibility exists.  The
 5       probability perhaps exists that someone could make the
 6       assertion that if it's not precisely over the center
 7       line, that reading the claim, it could be claimed to
 8       infringe.
 9           This is because of the confusion that's introduced
10       by the language, the difficulty of understanding what the
11       claim really means, that now you can interpret it in a
12       way that is-- I guess I would say it's inappropriate
13       because then it's like every product infringes.
14           There are-- it would be-- we would be challenged to
15       find products where the spacer is precisely over the
16       center line of the gate line because that's really not
17       the criteria that people use.
18           You just tuck it under the black matrix.
19   Q   Is the claim indefinite if most devices would infringe
20       it?
21                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
22                         THE WITNESS:  No.  No.
23           The claim-- my testimony is that the claim is
24       indefinite because we cannot really understand what it
25       means, and if it's interpreted-- in effect,
0047
 1       misinterpreted, can be misinterpreted, then basically
 2       we're saying that every prior art device now infringes
 3       this particular patent.
 4   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Is the claim indefinite if it's invalid in
 5       view of the prior art?
 6                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 7                         THE WITNESS:  No, I don't mean to make
 8       that confusion.
 9           I am just saying if we get into the position where a
10       claim cannot be understood, where it cannot be read, then
11       a variety of misinterpretations are possible, and then
12       one could be led to the situation where if I interpret it
13       a certain way, now certain prior art patents become
14       potentially prior art or not, so, again, if you can't
15       tell what it's talking about, now you are scrambling to
16       interpret it in some way, and two very capable people
17       could interpret it totally opposite ways because neither
18       of them fully understands what it says.
19   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Is there more than one way to interpret
20       the shifting phrase of claim one of the '327 patent?
21   A   Yes.
22           For one example-- there's a number of examples where
23       it could be interpreted different and in several ways.
24           One is that there is no-- because it has no
25       reference to the rubbing direction, which was important
0048
 1       in the specification, I can now shift it any direction
 2       that I want.
 3           I can find a common line and say, "Okay, I can shift
 4       it one way or I can shift it another way."  There are
 5       common lines that I can reference both ways.
 6           The other is the phrase "toward above."
 7           Then the third one is the-- yes, this "partially
 8       overruns"-- "partially overruns from above the gate line
 9       toward above the common line."
10           What does "partially overrun" mean?
11   Q   What does "partially overrun" mean?
12   A   I don't know.
13   Q   Do you know what "partially" means?
14   A   "Partially" means "some part of," but it needs to be-- it
15       can be-- "partially" could be one percent.  It could be
16       99 percent.  It could be 0.1 percent.
17           Without any context, without any reference,
18       "partially" has a very wide and ambiguous meaning.
19   Q   Why is "partially" ambiguous?
20   A   Again, because it can be-- if I'm off by a tenth of a
21       micron, did I just-- did I just satisfy the claim here.
22           In the exemplary embodiment, it gives us a range.
23       It says, "Okay, well, it should be between two and a half
24       and three and a half microns."
25           This gives us no guidance whatsoever.
0049
 1           I could measure a tenth of a micron, which would be
 2       perhaps a normal manufacturing tolerance, and I could
 3       say, "It partially overruns.  There, the product
 4       infringes."
 5           Without some reasonableness, something attached that
 6       gives us some guidance of what this means, it's
 7       ambiguous.
 8           I don't-- there's no way to interpret this to say
 9       whether we're practicing this patent or not.
10   Q   You gave an example where you said you measured a tenth
11       of a micron, and then that was a very small amount.
12           What if it was zero microns, there was no
13       overrunning at all?  Would that be partially overrun?
14                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
15                         THE WITNESS:  In a practical sense we
16       can't measure zero.
17           We can measure maybe ten nanometers or something
18       really small, but there's some dimension, probably in the
19       order of ten nanometers or something like that, where you
20       say, "That's below my ability to measure, and the spacer
21       doesn't have enough uniformity for me to make that
22       measurement," but it could be anything above that.
23            It could be anything I could find that is-- in fact,
24       as I was saying earlier, I had looked at some actual
25       photos of spacers, and they tend to be spaced somewhat
0050
 1       nonuniformly.
 2           There is not a precise line I can look at and say,
 3       "Do they"-- and say, "Okay.  Well, that would partially
 4       overrun."
 5           I think the other-- the other confusion, the other
 6       uncertainty here is, what do we really mean by "overrun"?
 7           Does it mean it still has to have some contact to
 8       the gate line or does it not?
 9           Can it be-- if I go-- let's say I have a gate line
10       and a common line, and I have a black matrix above, and I
11       put my spacers down the middle.  They're not on either
12       one.  Am I partially overrunning the gate line?
13           I don't know how to interpret this term.
14           If I'm not touching the gate line, does that mean
15       that I'm not doing what this claim is intended to say?
16   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Let's turn to Paragraph No. 43 of your
17       report.
18           I am looking at the very-- the second to last
19       sentence on the bottom of Page 11 where you state that
20       "One of ordinary skill in the art would understand there
21       are several common lines in an LCD panel."
22           Do you see that statement?
23   A   Yes.
24   Q   What LCD panel are you referring to?
25   A   This is a broad statement of an LCD panel where common
0051
 1       lines exist.
 2   Q   Does every LCD panel have a common line?
 3   A   As I testified earlier, if we talk about vertically
 4       aligned panels, they have a common electrode on the top
 5       surface and out at the edge where there may be additional
 6       common lines to provide better conductivity.
 7           A vertically aligned would have common lines, but
 8       this would not be what is described in this patent-- I
 9       believe at the very beginning they talk about-- let me
10       see if I can find this real quick like.
11            It says, "At the field of invention."
12           The intent here was to talk about, I believe,
13       devices where the common electrodes and the common lines
14       were on the same substrate as the TFTs, because that's
15       how it's described here.
16           Specifically the '327 patent, the descriptions and
17       the embodiments talk about common lines that are on the
18       same substrate as the TFT and would be the same as the--
19       where the gate lines are.
20   Q   Does every LCD panel have a common line?
21   A   Every LCD panel requires an electrical connection to the
22       common electrode, so there is a common line somewhere.
23           It may just be out at the periphery, but you have to
24       make an electrical connection, and the electrical
25       connection would be through a common line.
0052
 1           In the specific configurations described here, there
 2       are a number of common lines that parallel the gate
 3       lines.
 4   Q   When you say "described here," what were you referring
 5       to?
 6   A   The embodiments in the '327 patent.
 7   Q   Would it be possible to form an LCD panel that only has
 8       one common line?
 9   A   In a vertically aligned display?  Yes, or in a twisted
10       nematic also.
11   Q   Is it required for LCD panels to include more than one
12       common line?
13   A   No.  You need a common electrode, and the common
14       electrode would apply to a twisted nematic.  It would
15       apply to vertically aligned, but that common electrode
16       has to be connected to the outside world, and it would be
17       connected through a common line, which may only exist on
18       the periphery.
19   Q   To practice claim one of the '327 patent, would a device
20       need to have more than one common line?
21   A   No.
22           The '327 only says that we need a common line
23       parallel to the gate line, so in that context, yes, one
24       common line would meet the limitation of this claim.
25   Q   Is it your opinion that you cannot identify the location
0053
 1       of the claimed common line with certainty?
 2   A   When we have multiple common lines, then there is nothing
 3       in claim one that points us to identifying which one we
 4       should reference.
 5   Q   What if the claimed common line is identified for you,
 6       then would you know which common line is discussed by the
 7       claim?
 8   A   I'm sorry, what was the first part of your question?
 9                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
10   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  What if someone identified the common line
11       for you, would you then know which common line to-- as
12       your reference point--
13                         MR. APREOTESI:  Same objection.
14                         THE WITNESS:  Well, if you identify--
15       if you point to a specific common line and say, "Yes, you
16       are pointing to this common line," so-- if you are
17       pointing out a common line to me, I would not-- I would
18       say, "Yes, I agree with you, that is a common line."
19   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  In Paragraph No. 43 I believe we discussed
20       that you stated the LCD devices include multiple common
21       lines; is that correct?
22   A   Typically, yes.
23   Q   What if there is a device where the shifting limitation
24       is met with respect to one common line but not another
25       common line, would the device practice that limitation in
0054
 1       that sense?
 2   A   Whenever this columnar spacer is not precisely over the
 3       center line of the gate line, it would be shifted one
 4       direction or the other, so yes, if there are common lines
 5       somewhere in the panel, I would say yes, it satisfies--
 6       it's shifted toward a common line.
 7           So either direction would be acceptable, on the
 8       basis of the claim.
 9   Q   Let's turn to Paragraph No. 44 of your report, the next
10       paragraph over.
11           There you state that "One of ordinary skill in the
12       art would not know what direction to shift the columnar
13       spacer, whether one would shift it toward or shift it
14       above the common line and how one would shift it both
15       toward and above the common line."
16           Do you see that?
17   A   Yes.
18   Q   What does "shift toward" mean?
19   A   It's the words together "toward above."
20           If we take them separately, if you talk about
21       "toward," I can understand that.
22           If we talk about "above" separately, I think I can
23       understand that.
24           When you now glue those two words together, now I
25       don't know what you mean.
0055
 1           What is "toward above"?
 2           "Toward" and "above" are basically-- if I think in
 3       terms of math terms, they're orthogonal to each other.
 4            "Toward" might be in a horizontal direction.
 5       "Above" might be in a vertical direction, so does
 6       "toward" and "above" mean at some sloping angle, that I'm
 7       shifting-- so there is where we cannot unravel it.
 8           I cannot unravel those two terms together in any
 9       kind of common sense way.
10   Q   Does the specification provide any context of what "shift
11       toward above" means?
12   A   I don't believe the specification actually uses those
13       words together.
14           I would have to go through and double check that.
15           What I get from the specification is used in
16       exemplary embodiments.  There is a shifting, what I would
17       perhaps think of as more toward.
18           The "above" part, I don't know what that means, as
19       far as those two words sticking together.
20   Q   In your previous answer or a couple answers ago, you said
21       you know what "shift toward" means, but just those two
22       words, setting aside the word "above," what does "shift
23       toward" mean?
24   A   First of all, you have to tell me, toward what?
25           It would be-- "shifting toward" would mean some kind
0056
 1       of translation, some kind of a movement from one position
 2       to another, and the second position would be towards
 3       something-- some object or boundary or element that
 4       you've identified for me so that I know, "Well, if I'm
 5       shifting toward, it's toward you."
 6            You are sitting across the table, so if I'm going to
 7       shift this document toward, and you say, "Well, it's
 8       toward me," okay, I move it toward you.
 9           Yes, that would be understandable as common English
10       language.
11   Q   In the same question with "shift above," setting aside
12       the word "toward," what does "shift above" mean to you?
13   A   I don't know what it means in the context of these
14       columnar spacings because we don't move them up and down.
15           There is no-- the top substrate is brought together
16       with the bottom substrate, and they simply sit on top of
17       each other.
18           When you said "I'm going to shift above," above
19       what?
20           That one I can't-- I can't put a logical meaning on
21       it because I don't know-- we're not climbing.  We are not
22       moving it up and down, that I know of.
23   Q   So one of ordinary skill in the art would know that the
24       spacers are not shifted in a vertical direction, correct?
25           Is that what you were saying in your last answer?
0057
 1   A   Well, the one possibility in interpreting this is to say,
 2       "Well, the gate line and the common line have some small
 3       thickness to them that's on the order of a fraction of a
 4       micron."
 5            Now, if I'm sitting above a gate line, do I want to
 6       shift toward and above the common line?
 7            So if I'm trying to add meeting that's not in the
 8       claim, but I'm trying to add meeting of what could it
 9       possibly mean-- you know, engineers love to solve
10       problems, so as an engineer I say, "Well, I am going to
11       try to figure out this ambiguity," and say, "Well, maybe
12       the 'above' means that I go from above the gate line, and
13       then there's this slight depression between the gate and
14       the column, and that somehow I'm going to end up on top
15       of the column," but it doesn't say that.  It just says
16       we're partially doing it.
17           If it said, "I am going to shift to above the common
18       line," you could say, "I might know what that means."
19           As it's written, I don't know what the "above" means
20       because it only says I'm partially shifting.
21           If I'm only partially moving off the gate line, I
22       don't do anything above.  It stays horizontal, so I
23       cannot interpret that word either by itself or together
24       with the "toward."
25   Q   The two terms that we have been discussing, "shift
0058
 1       toward" and "shift above," are those two mutually
 2       exclusive?
 3                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 4                         THE WITNESS:  No, but they're glued
 5       together in the claim.
 6           The claim does not put an "and" or any kind of
 7       qualifier between those two.
 8           If we're talking in a normal English language way, I
 9       can understand what I said earlier, what shifting toward
10       means, that I'm now shifting something toward you.
11           Now, at the same time if you say I'm shifting above,
12       then is it above the top of your head?  Is it-- I don't
13       know what-- "shifting above" to me means some change in
14       elevation, it has to be something in the vertical
15       direction.
16           That's what it means to me.
17           I don't know how to make that meaning in the context
18       of the '327 patent.
19   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Is that because-- strike that.
20           You said "I don't know how to make that meaning in
21       the context of the '327 patent."
22           Is that because a person of ordinary skill would
23       realize that you can't shift the spacers up and down in a
24       horizontal manner?
25   A   I think even more than that.
0059
 1           I will use this document to say I am going to shift
 2       the document toward you.
 3           Okay.  Now, if I say, "I am going to shift this
 4       document toward and above you," what do you think-- I'm--
 5       I can't ask you questions.
 6   Q   That's a good thing.
 7   A   I would not know-- if you said that to me-- if you take
 8       the document and say, "Dr. Silzars, I want to shift this
 9       document toward you," that's clear.
10           "Dr. Silzars, I want to shift this document toward
11       above you," I would look at you with a puzzled look, "I
12       don't know what he just said," and I would ask you for
13       clarification and say, "What do you mean you are going to
14       shift this document toward and above me?  Should I be
15       holding it up?  Should I what?"
16           It's not just in the context of the patent.
17           It's a broader context that those two words together
18       are, for me, impossible to unravel.
19   Q   In your last answer you said you would ask me for
20       clarification.
21           Do you think if clarification were provided, that
22       you would be able to shift that document toward and above
23       me?
24   A   My expectation would be that in your clarification, you
25       would use more words.
0060
 1           You might say something like, "Dr. Silzars, what I
 2       meant was I am going to shift the document toward you,
 3       and I want you to hold it up in front of you, so my
 4       statement was that I'm going to-- when I say I was going
 5       to shift toward above you, I wanted you to pick it up and
 6       hold it up," but you have now given me an explanation
 7       that I can understand.
 8           Now, if you go back and simply say, "My explanation
 9       is I want you to-- the document is going to be shifted
10       toward above you," and that's it, I still don't
11       understand.
12           You would need to provide some additional
13       explanation as to what did you really mean because the
14       words-- just those two words together, I could not get.
15   Q   Does the specification of the '327 patent provide that
16       additional explanation that you would need to know the
17       meaning of "shift toward above"?
18   A   It provides an explanation in the embodiments that are
19       shown about the "toward."
20           The "above" part is not clear to me.
21           The only part that is introduced also is that they
22       talked about this roughened surface at the bottom of the
23       column to prevent retention of images if the spacers
24       can't move, but I don't relate that to the "above."
25           I think that's a separate issue.
0061
 1   Q   Going back to this Paragraph No. 43 of your report--
 2       excuse me, Paragraph No. 42, the very last sentence, you
 3       say, "One of ordinary skill in the art would not know
 4       what direction to shift the columnar spacer, whether one
 5       should shift toward or shift above the common line."
 6           Does the '327 patent claim shifting above the common
 7       line?
 8   A   I'm sorry, repeat the last question, the last part of
 9       your last question.
10   Q   The shifting phrase of claim one of the '327 patent, does
11       it claim shifting above the common line?
12   A   I don't know what it says because it puts those two words
13       together, so I was trying to interpret this and say,
14       "Here is part of the confusion."
15           Do I shift toward-- do I break those two up?  Do I
16       deal with them as a "toward" and "above" because I can't
17       deal with them together?
18           This is, again, where it's impossible to understand
19       the claim because-- I suppose if we said "to shift above
20       the common lines," then we might say, "Well, we shift it
21       over and we go on top of the common line," but I don't
22       think that's what it says because it only says it's
23       partially shifted.
24   Q   Claim one of the '327 patent requires just partial
25       shifting; is that correct?
0062
 1   A   I want to read it from the-- it says it "partially
 2       overruns from above the gate line," so "partially
 3       overruns" is the actual statement in the claim.
 4           Well, further it says, "partially overruns from
 5       above the gate line," so that's-- let's read the entire
 6       phrase, that "The spacer partially overruns from above
 7       the gate line," so I think it means that it may still be
 8       partly on top of the gate line.
 9   Q   What does it mean for the spacer to be on top of the gate
10       line?
11   A   Well, we've started this thing by saying that it has to
12       be-- since we're calling this the shifting phrase, that
13       we have to start from above the widthwise center of the
14       gate line, so that's our starting point, is that we're
15       going to find the center of the gate line and this is
16       where the spacer would have been, I suppose, and then
17       we're shifting so that it now partially overruns from the
18       gate line toward the common line.
19   Q   So earlier when you said the spacer is on top of the gate
20       line, did you mean it's above the gate line in a vertical
21       sense?
22   A   No.  What I meant was that it's positioned to sit above
23       the center line of the gate line and be in contact with
24       that location, so it sits, in a sense, above-- you have
25       the gate line, and the spacer sits on top of the gate
0063
 1       line, but it's actually part of the upper substrate, so
 2       when we assemble the display, we place it so that it's
 3       precisely centered over the gate line.
 4   Q   Is the spacer physically on the gate line?
 5                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 6                         THE WITNESS:  It's on whatever
 7       insulator.  It's on top of the rubbing layer.
 8           It's above but not directly in contact with-- so
 9       it's above, with some interlayers in there, but it sits
10       positioned over the center of the gate line.
11           Actually, it sits on top of the rubbing layer.
12   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  So when we're referring to all in the gate
13       line or above the gate line, it's the physical-- not
14       physical, but the vertical space above the gate line; is
15       that correct?
16                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection--
17                         THE WITNESS:  Yes.
18           I am not quite sure how to explain it more clearly,
19       but it's the location.
20           We're not talking about some height restrictions or
21       vertical connections.
22           We're simply talking about the positioning with
23       regard to the lower substrate.
24           The lower substrate has gate lines on it.  I pick a
25       gate line.  I find the center of the gate line.  When I
0064
 1       bring the top substrate down, it's now going to be
 2       positioned dead center over that gate line.
 3           That's my goal.  That's what this says was basically
 4       the starting point.
 5           "This is what I was going to do, and now I'm going
 6       to shift to some new location."
 7   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Let's look at Paragraph No. 44 of your
 8       report.
 9           You state that "The specification does not provide
10       any guidance above the described 'toward above common
11       line.'"
12           Do you still hold that opinion?
13   A   Yes.
14           I don't believe I've been able to find anything in
15       the specification that uses the words "toward above"
16       together.
17   Q   In the next paragraph, Paragraph No. 45, you say that
18       "The specification describes shifting in a direction
19       reverse to the rubbing direction"; is that correct?
20   A   That's what the specification describes, yes, but not the
21       claim.
22   Q   Is that description of shifting opposite the rubbing
23       direction, does that not provide guidance to the
24       direction of the shifting described in the claim?
25   A   Well, it provides guidance in the specification but not
0065
 1       in the claim, because the claim does not mention a
 2       shifting direction or a rubbing direction-- I mean, it
 3       mentions shifting direction, but it does not mention any
 4       relationship to a rubbing direction.
 5   Q   If claim one included a limitation with the rubbing
 6       direction, would it then be definite?
 7                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 8                         THE WITNESS:  It would-- I don't know
 9       that-- we'd have to read the new claim language, but it
10       would certainly be of some help.
11           If the claim had included a statement about the
12       rubbing direction and the intent that-- you know,
13       basically the only reason this patent was written was
14       to-- because they were having problems with lights
15       leaking out the edge and said, "Well, where do we put the
16       spacers to reduce this leakage?"
17           They said, "Well, the leakage is caused by the
18       rubbing, and it's basically downwind from the rubbing
19       direction where we're getting the shadowing, so let's
20       move the spacer over."
21           The rubbing direction was absolutely crucial to the
22       reason behind this claimed dimension, and so without
23       mentioning the rubbing direction, now the claim could be
24       read over any display regardless of how they do the
25       rubbing.
0066
 1   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Is the claim's definiteness determination
 2       made in a vacuum?
 3                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 4                         THE WITNESS:  I don't know what you
 5       mean by "vacuum."
 6   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  When you are making a claim definiteness
 7       determination, do you review only the claim?
 8                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 9                         THE WITNESS:  No.  I would view the
10       claim in light of the specification, but we also have to
11       be cognizant of the fact that the inventors said that
12       they wanted this claim to be read broadly and beyond just
13       the exemplary embodiments that were in the specification.
14           Yes, we can certainly look for guidance, but we can
15       say, "Okay, what else can this claim encompass," and just
16       because it's broader doesn't mean that it's indefinite,
17       but the fact that it's not understandable, that it now
18       introduces words and structures and explanations that
19       don't fit the embodiments, that's where I think it
20       becomes difficult to interpret-- impossible to interpret.
21   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  In your last answer, what statement by the
22       inventors are you referring to?
23   A   The specific statement that I just now was intending to
24       refer to is just above-- it says, "What is claimed?"
25           The paragraph above says, "While this invention has
0067
 1       been described in connection with certain preferred
 2       embodiments, it is to be understood that the subject
 3       matter encompassed by way of this invention is not to be
 4       limited to those specific embodiments.  On the contrary,
 5       it is intended for the subject matter of the invention to
 6       include all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents
 7       as can be included within the spirit and scope of the
 8       following claims."
 9           This is not an atypical statement.  Most patents
10       have this, but we have to appreciate then that the claim
11       is what is going to be the criteria for infringement, not
12       just the embodiments that are shown in the patent.
13   Q   If the inventors did not include that paragraph that you
14       cited in the last answer, would it change your opinion on
15       whether claim one of the '327 patent is indefinite?
16   A   It would not change my opinion about the impossibility of
17       interpreting that last shifting clause in a reasonable
18       way.
19           I still would not be able to understand it.
20           If they had not had that in there-- I suppose if
21       they had a statement in there that says, "What we intend
22       is that the claims will apply to the embodiments," I
23       would say, "Okay, now I can understand it.  I can go back
24       to the embodiments and use those," so-- but even without
25       that specific statement, I would not have-- it would not
0068
 1       help me in interpreting this last shifting clause.
 2   Q   In forming your opinion, did you review Figure 2 of the
 3       '327 patent?
 4   A   Yes.
 5   Q   Does Figure 2 illustrate a gate line?
 6   A   Yes.  I believe that's Element 102.
 7   Q   Does Figure 2 illustrate a common line?
 8   A   I believe that's Element 103.
 9   Q   And does Figure 2 illustrate a columnar spacing?
10   A   Does it illustrate a columnar spacing?  Yes.  That would
11       be 254.
12   Q   And Figure 2 shows an arrow up at the top right above the
13       words "Rubbing direction for an opposite substrate."
14           Do you see that?
15   A   Yes.
16   Q   Which way is that arrow pointing?
17   A   From right to left.
18   Q   Can we turn to Column 5 of the '327 patent?
19           Look at the second full paragraph.
20           It begins around Line No. 19 of Column No. 5.
21           Do you see that paragraph?
22   A   Line No. 19 of Column No. 5?  Yes.
23   Q   Can you read the first sentence of that paragraph,
24       starting with "moreover"?
25   A   "Moreover, the center of the columnar spacer 254 is
0069
 1       located while being shifted with respect to the gate line
 2       102 in a direction reverse to the rubbing direction for
 3       the orientation film 214 of the opposite substrate 200."
 4   Q   Just a minute ago we established that Figure 2 shows the
 5       rubbing direction as right to left, correct?
 6   A   Yes.
 7                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
 8   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  What is the opposite direction of right to
 9       left?
10   A   Would be from left to right.
11   Q   So in the context of Figure 2, the specification is
12       describing shifting the columnar spacer from left to
13       right; is that correct?
14   A   Yes.
15   Q   So with respect to Figure 2, the specification tells you
16       which way to shift the columnar spacer, right?
17   A   It tells you how to shift it with regard to the rubbing
18       direction, yes.
19   Q   And in this context of Figure 2, is the columnar spacer
20       being shifted toward the common line?
21   A   Yes.
22   Q   And in this same context of Figure 2, is the columnar
23       spacer being shifted above the common line?
24   A   That's not clear.
25           It's being shifted toward.
0070
 1           If we shift far enough, it would end up being-- it
 2       would end up being above the common line, but I don't
 3       know if it's being shifted above the common line.  It
 4       would just-- as we shift toward the common line, we would
 5       also end up above the common line if we go far enough.
 6   Q   How far would you have to shift the columnar spacer for
 7       it to be above the common line?
 8   A   This, of course, depends on a configuration of the
 9       display itself, but based on displays that I've examined,
10       the gate line and the common line are-- may be typically
11       ten to 15 microns apart.
12           They would not be two or three microns apart because
13       there's a manufacturing tolerance, you want to keep
14       things separate, so in a typical display, it would be
15       something on that order of ten, 15 microns, which is-- it
16       would be wider than is shown in this figure.
17   Q   Looking at this figure, Figure 2 of the '327 patent,
18       there is a number, 254, that's pointing toward the
19       columnar spacer.
20           Do you see that number?
21   A   Yes.
22   Q   This number 254, as shown on Figure 2, is it above the
23       common line?
24   A   As shown, it is not above the common line.
25   Q   Also shown in Figure 2 is a number 114.
0071
 1           Do you see that?
 2   A   Yes.
 3   Q   Can you draw a circle around 114?
 4   A   Sure.
 5   Q   That circle that you just drew, is that located above the
 6       common line?
 7   A   There's some part of 114 that is above the common line.
 8           It's the rubbing layer.
 9           As I remember, 114 is the rubbing layer, so exactly
10       where it's pointing, it is somewhat at the edge of the
11       common line, but certainly a good part of 114 is also
12       above the common line, yes.
13   Q   Okay.  I am just talking about the circle that you drew,
14       not the actual rubbing layer as 114.
15           If that circle were physically in that location in
16       the device, would it be above the common line?
17   A   A part of it would be above the common line.
18           My poorly drawn circle, about half of it would be
19       above the common line.
20   Q   Which half would be above the common line?
21   A   The part that's to the left, that's sort of sitting above
22       the "11," and that part would be considered to be sitting
23       above the common line.
24   Q   Do you see the No. 242 on Figure 2?
25           It's kind of on the top left.
0072
 1   A   Yes.
 2   Q   If that number were a physical part of the device, would
 3       that physical location be above the common line?
 4   A   Just the number?
 5   Q   Just the number.
 6   A   Just the number?  Mostly.
 7           It looks like maybe the last two would be off-- a
 8       little bit off the edge, but mostly it would be over the
 9       common line.
10   Q   And you're referring to the 252 at the top right--
11   A   Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
12   Q   Okay.  Now, Column No. 5 that we discussed earlier talked
13       about shifting the columnar spacer, and it showed the
14       direction.
15           Disclosed in that paragraph, is a columnar spacer
16       being shifted toward that circle that you drew?
17   A   According to-- yes, according to this description and
18       this embodiment, yes.
19   Q   I know we have gone through this briefly earlier, but do
20       you understand the problems that the inventors of the
21       '327 patent set out to solve?
22   A   My understanding is they set out to solve two problems:
23           One was that because of this-- what they called sort
24       of a shadowing effect when they do the rubbing, that
25       downstream from the rubbing roller, that they don't get
0073
 1       the same behavior because of the column sitting there and
 2       basically bumping up against the rubbing roller, that
 3       they wanted to shift the column further over under the
 4       black matrix, so they were going to relocate it so that
 5       this shadow effect would be hidden under the black
 6       matrix.
 7           The second problem that they said they were working
 8       on was that when there is pressure placed on the display,
 9       that there is a residual image formed, and their belief
10       was that it was formed because the spacers are unable to
11       move in response to that pressure.
12           They then suggested a configuration that's shown in
13       Figure 5B where the part of the spacer that contacts the
14       lower substrate is actually-- has slight indentations,
15       rubbing-- it's hard to say.
16           It has a roughening.
17           The surface is a little bit rough and it has little
18       features on it which presumably makes it easier for it to
19       move in response to pressure on the display.
20           Those were the two problems that I believe they were
21       trying to improve upon.
22   Q   Going back toward that first problem that you discussed,
23       if you look at Column No. 2 of the '327 patent, right
24       around Line No. 6 or 7, it says, "It is an object of the
25       present invention to provide"--
0074
 1   A   I'm sorry, which line was it again?
 2   Q   Sorry.
 3           It's the second line under the "Summary of the
 4       invention" heading.
 5           It starts with "Specifically."
 6           Do you see that sentence?
 7   A   What is the line number?
 8   Q   Column 2, line-- it looks about 7.
 9   A   Okay, now I see it.
10   Q   And it says, "Specifically, it is an object of the
11       present invention to provide a liquid crystal display
12       device capable of eliminating an influence of shades
13       (area where rubbing is insufficient) in rubbing an
14       orientation film, the shades occurring due to columnar
15       spacers."
16           Do you understand what is meant by that portion of
17       the specification I just read?
18   A   Yes.
19   Q   In your opinion would a person of ordinary skill in the
20       art understand that portion of the specification that I
21       just read?
22   A   I think they would understand the description, yes.
23   Q   Why would columnar spacers cause shades?
24   A   Because the rubbing is a mechanical process.
25           You can think of it as kind of a roller that
0075
 1       rotates, and so the orientation film is uniformly placed
 2       over the substrate, so the rubbing roller, as a
 3       mechanical device-- if we can think of it that I have a
 4       roller coming over and here's a spacer, and it hits the
 5       spacer, and on the opposite side of the direction that
 6       the roller is moving, I don't get contact with the roller
 7       nap as it crosses over the spacer-- so there's an area, a
 8       small area, where the rubbing is slightly different than
 9       over the uniform surface.
10           That is this shadowing effect that they're
11       addressing in this particular invention, so no-- I think
12       as far as is it understandable to one skilled in the art?
13       Yes.
14           If you know how the rubbing is done, you would
15       understand that it's a mechanical process, that the
16       roller comes over these little bumps, and then on the
17       back side of the bumps you may not get the same rubbing
18       effect as you do in a smooth surface.
19   Q   Would a person of ordinary skill know how the rubbing is
20       done?
21   A   Given our definition of who is a person of ordinary
22       skill, yes, because that's now been described in
23       textbooks.
24           It's pretty much known in the industry.
25           There is a highly proprietary part to rubbing,
0076
 1       exactly what materials are used, exactly what pressures
 2       are used, but the fact that it's done by a mechanical
 3       abrasion, in effect, by introducing microstructures into
 4       the orientation film, that is known.
 5   Q   And I believe you mentioned this in the previous answer,
 6       but which side of the columnar spacers would the rubbing
 7       be insufficient?
 8   A   Well, basically it's on the side where-- the rubbing
 9       roller comes from, let's say, right to left-- left to
10       right, so you have a column sitting up here, and the
11       rubbing roller is rotating and is being brought across
12       the surface.
13           It would be on the-- it's the shadow side.  It's the
14       side where-- where the rubbing roller approaches the
15       column, it would not have a problem.
16           Where the rubbing roller crosses over the column, it
17       would be immediately on that back side where you might
18       have a problem.
19           By the way, since-- like I said, this rubbing
20       technology is very proprietary.  There's all kinds of
21       special methods.
22           Not everyone would have the same level of issue or
23       have the same level of problem.
24           This is a particular situation that these inventors
25       felt needed to be improved upon.
0077
 1           Of course the other situation would be if I placed
 2       the spacers in a different place, I've compensated for
 3       this shadowing by my black matrix and I don't need to
 4       necessarily be concerned about this.
 5           That's what they're explaining here.
 6   Q   What problems are caused by the rubbing being
 7       insufficient on the back side of the columnar spacers?
 8   A   If I don't have the same uniformity in rubbing, the
 9       liquid crystal molecules will not necessarily orient in
10       the same way, and if they don't orient the same way, then
11       the light transmission will be affected, so I would get
12       what they call this light leakage effect where there's--
13       the liquid crystal molecules didn't get reoriented
14       sufficiently, so now when I want to have a fully black
15       display, and the back light, of course, is always on,
16       that I might have little places where I can see slight
17       amounts of light leakage coming through.
18   Q   Do you know what the inventors proposed to do to reduce
19       or eliminate this problem of shading on the back side of
20       the columnar spacers?
21   A   What they proposed to do was to relocate the spacers, to
22       move them further under the black matrix.
23   Q   How would moving the spacers further under the black
24       matrix reduce or eliminate this shading effect?
25   A   Well, the shading effect is very localized.
0078
 1           It's in that immediate vicinity of the spacer.
 2           In fact, the black matrix is used to define the
 3       active areas.  It's used to shade the TFT, so the black
 4       matrix is ubiquitous to all the displays.
 5           If I tuck the spacer further under the black matrix,
 6       this localized shadowing will be basically invisible to
 7       the viewer.
 8   Q   When you were determining the scope of claim one of the
 9       '327 patent, did you consider this problem and proposed
10       solution by the inventors, as described in the
11       specification?
12   A   I did consider that, but as-- I've been told that the
13       claim has to be read in what it really says, that it's
14       not read only in the context of the specification, that
15       it can have additional-- it can capture additional
16       configurations.
17   Q   In determining the scope of the claims, do you think a
18       person of ordinary skill in the art would look to the
19       problems and proposed solutions described in the
20       specification?
21   A   I think they would do very much what I did, which is
22       what-- you read the patent, read the description in the
23       patent, and then you look at the claim and say, "Well,
24       certainly if I try to understand the words that are in
25       the claim," which-- I want to make sure-- I still don't
0079
 1       understand them.
 2           "Well, certainly the claim is intended to cover the
 3       exemplary embodiments"-- so if I look at the exemplary
 4       embodiments and I look at the claim, yes, the claim could
 5       be read to encompass those exemplary embodiments, if I
 6       really-- using an exemplary body as more so than the
 7       language of the claim.
 8   Q   So does the specification provide any context for this
 9       shifting direction of the columnar spacer?
10                         MR. APREOTESI:  Objection; form.
11                         THE WITNESS:  The exemplary
12       embodiments provide guidance on the shifting direction.
13           The claim does not.
14   Q   (By Mr. Tice)  Let's turn to Page 6 of your report.
15           I want to look at Paragraph No. 25 where you state
16       the qualifications of a person of ordinary skill in the
17       art.
18           How did you determine what a person of ordinary
19       skill in the art would be, in relation to the '327
20       patent?
21   A   We know that there are no specific degrees in liquid
22       crystal display technology.
23           Maybe there are in China or Korea, but not in the
24       U.S., so our beginning point has to be, "What would"--
25       within the context of these patents and within the
0080
 1       context of skill sets available to us, "What engineering
 2       degree would they have had," and really the physics,
 3       optics, electrical engineering, those are all appropriate
 4       degrees, and then you do need-- to understand this
 5       patent, you do need some experience in the field of
 6       display technology, which today specifically would be
 7       liquid crystal displays as the most dominant technology.
 8           It's an approximate listing of skills and
 9       experience.
10           If you told me it should be four years or two years,
11       I wouldn't have a giant argument over it.
12           It really depends on where they're working and what
13       they're doing and do they understand this kind of a
14       structure.
15   Q   Would it be possible for a person of ordinary skill--
16       strike that.
17           Would it be possible for a person to meet the
18       requirements of a person of ordinary skill and not have
19       an undergraduate degree in physics, optics, or electrical
20       engineering?
21   A   It would be-- in all of our-- I have managed quite large
22       groups in my past.
23           The current position is that you always put in "or
24       equivalent," so yeah, it does not-- you cannot really
25       hire people just based on having a certain degree.
0081
 1           If they have the experience base, if they have
 2       worked in the field, if they have the experience-- so
 3       perhaps something here should have said "or equivalent,"
 4       but yeah, a degree is not mandatory in order to be
 5       working in this field.
 6                         MR. TICE:  Let's take another quick
 7       break.

17                          MR. TICE:  All right.  Dr. Silzars,
18       that's all the questions I have for you at this time.
19           Thank you for coming out and spending your time with
20       us this morning.
21                          THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.
22                            EXAMINATION
23       BY MR. APREOTESI:
24   Q   Dr. Silzars, I only have a few questions for you.
25            Earlier today you were asked questions about whether
0082
 1       a device could possibly only have one common line.
 2           Do you recall that?
 3   A   Yes.
 4   Q   What-- in that situation what types of devices would only
 5       have one common line?
 6   A   What I was describing at that point were generally
 7       basically all the possibilities for liquid crystal
 8       displays, and ones that are twisted nematic or vertically
 9       aligned, the common electrode is on the top surface, the
10       upper surface where the color filters are.
11           For those types of displays, we only need a
12       connection.  We need to make one connection to that
13       display, but the connection has to be to the outside
14       world.
15           Where we make that connection would be considered a
16       common line, or the alternative wording that we sometimes
17       use is "wiring," so you have to connect to any kind of
18       electrode, and the line is what we use to make that
19       connection.
20           If the electrode is of uniform over the entire
21       surface, we only need one connection, so at the periphery
22       we would need a common line or a common connection.
23   Q   So in that situation, with a single common line for a TN
24       or a vertically aligned device, would the common line
25       also be on the color filter substrate?
0083
 1   A   Yes.
 2   Q   Same as the common electrode?
 3   A   Yes, it would be.
 4                         MR. APREOTESI:  No further questions.
 5                         MR. TICE:  None from me.
 6                         VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  This
 7       concludes the video deposition of Dr. Silzars, consisting
 8       of two media units.
 9           We are going off the record.  The time is 10:40.

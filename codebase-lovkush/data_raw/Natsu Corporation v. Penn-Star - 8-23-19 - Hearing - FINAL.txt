          1                        TELEPHONIC HEARING

          2                     FRIDAY, AUGUST 23, 2019

          3                            1:06 p.m.

          4   

          5   

          6             MS. BURKE:  All right.  Well, I have some

          7    questions just kind of for both parties.  And then once I

          8    go through that, I will get let you guys, you know, make

          9    your comments and stuff.  I mean we have had a substantial

         10    amount of briefing on this.  I don't necessarily think we

         11    need a lot more argument, but I did have some questions.

         12             So, for the Penn-Star folks, I guess Anne Marie,

         13    I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

         14             Is there -- do you have some authority for the

         15    proposition that you can't address -- that you cannot

         16    address two disparate issues within one motion?  I know

         17    you guys are taking exception to the fact that plaintiff

         18    has combined the motion for protective order along with

         19    the motion for sanctions for violation of the court order,

         20    and I'm just wondering if there's something that you can

         21    add to that.

         22             MS. ELLIS:  Well, I think what's most troubling

         23    about that motion is there is absolutely no case law cited

         24    with respect to the second part of the motion for

         25    protective order that relates to every one in number two.




                                                                        5



          1    So there's no authority.  There's no -- absolutely no code

          2    reference.  So as far as we read the motion, especially a

          3    motion for protective order, with half of it not even

          4    applying to issues that relate to the motion for

          5    protective order.  And so the biggest concern is we don't

          6    even know what claims he's moving under because there's no

          7    case law cited, no citations to CCP or CRC or any

          8    statutory authority.

          9             MS. BURKE:  Well, it seems that he is basically

         10    just stating that the discovery order number two that was

         11    entered by the court wasn't complied with.  And he has

         12    cited that the Ford case, you know, in support of the

         13    proposition that you can get these kinds of sanctions.

         14             MS. ELLIS:  Well, Miss Burke, I mean did you

         15    actually -- if the motion is a motion for violation of

         16    court order or a motion to compel Miss Wilkinson's

         17    deposition under also time barred, in which -- we were

         18    really essentially left guessing what the authority was

         19    that he was moving under.  And there was no -- you know,

         20    when we're trying to get to the statutes that he's moving

         21    under, it's like a moving target.  And so I think the

         22    arguments are misplaced in this motion.

         23             And for what he is seeking, for example,

         24    attorney/compliant privileged information, that can only

         25    be done in response to a motion to compel.  And I do have




                                                                        6



          1    authority for that.  That would be I think -- I can find

          2    the cases as we're talking.

          3             MS. BURKE:  Are you talking about the Scottsdale

          4    case?

          5             MS. ELLIS:  No.  It was another case I was

          6    looking at earlier.

          7             But essentially if plaintiff is seeking to get

          8    attorney/client privileged information, it needs to be

          9    under a motion for authority or a motion to compel, not

         10    just this random motion for protective without any case

         11    law.

         12             MR. MERRILL:  If I could be heard.

         13             MS. BURKE:  Well, hang on -- hang on a sec.

         14             But it's a separate motion.  It's not a motion to

         15    compel.  It's a motion for enforcement of a court order

         16    that was entered as a result of a prior motion to compel.

         17             So I mean I guess I have some other questions

         18    too, you know.

         19             Do you guys feel you passed this in your papers

         20    about the time having passed and what not.  And I

         21    understand there's time deadlines for motion to compel,

         22    but do you have any authority or something that shows that

         23    there is a time deadline for basically sanctions for, you

         24    know, failure to comply with an already entered court

         25    order?




                                                                        7



          1             MS. ELLIS:  Miss Burke, we can work for that as

          2    we're talking, but the point is that there's been no

          3    violation of court order number two.  I mean I think

          4    that's what you need to go back to is our argument.  I

          5    mean this was -- essentially he's trying to move on issues

          6    that were dealt with at Miss Wilkinson's deposition on

          7    April 16th.

          8             And we have to sort of parse it out.  If we are

          9    talking about the Colonial Life issues, those issues have

         10    been resolved more or less in our emails.  We paid the

         11    sanctions.

         12             If you're talking about the production of the

         13    claim file, and the PMQ depositions, you can see that by

         14    all of the admissions that Mr. Merrill made on the record,

         15    that Miss Wilkinson addressed all of notices, except one.

         16    In fact we were halfway through that notice when that

         17    happened.  That was on April 16th.  But the claim file was

         18    produced by Mr. Cusick up through the date of litigation,

         19    the date that the complaint was filed.

         20             When plaintiff met and conferred on expanding the

         21    scope post the filing of the complaint, we complied with

         22    that.  And so if Mr. Merrill is moving on -- I mean you

         23    really have to parse out discovery order number two to

         24    talk about the fact that there was noncompliance.

         25             MS. BURKE:  And, Charlie, as I understand it what




                                                                        8



          1    you're complaining about with regard to compliance with

          2    discovery order number two was simply the production of

          3    documents associated with the PMQ depositions.  And my

          4    impression was that you believed that you had been

          5    provided the full claim file dates on the document done as

          6    of the date of the depo.

          7             MR. MERRILL:  Yes.  Yes.

          8             MS. BURKE:  But in fact -- but in fact going back

          9    later than you realized that you hadn't; is that correct?

         10             MR. MERRILL:  Yeah.  What happened is we were

         11    told at 5:00 in the afternoon that -- could you please

         12    take your deposition.  There were documents produced, over

         13    16,000.  They are here.  We want to get out of here.  And

         14    I had assumed they had produced everything.

         15             And the lasting example is that we get the claim

         16    file later on, and they are redacting, for instance, email

         17    letter from Mr. Cusick in October to them, and that's part

         18    of the production.  And I have a litany of things that

         19    they didn't produce.  And their privilege log has it in

         20    there.  They think they can have a privilege and I don't.

         21             And I do not think there is a time frame to bring

         22    to the court's attention the failure to comply with the

         23    court order.

         24             That's it.

         25             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  And likewise -- I mean with




                                                                        9



          1    regard to both the time frame, you know, Anne Marie, and

          2    also you guys mentioned that I think you feel that there

          3    should be a required to meet and confer before Charlie

          4    brings his motion for complaining about alleged

          5    noncompliance with the discovery order.

          6             Do you have any authority on that?  I mean I know

          7    that there is a requirement obviously for meet and confer

          8    with regard motions to compel and by enforcing a motion

          9    for protective order, which -- you know, but with regard

         10    to enforcement of a court order, I'm not aware of any meet

         11    and confer obligation.

         12             Do you have authority on that?

         13             MS. ELLIS:  Yeah.  Miss Burke, as we sit here

         14    today, if I could provide that to you after the hearing, I

         15    would do that.

         16             I just wanted to make sure that you're clear on

         17    the timeline here though because I think that it's

         18    important to understand.

         19             So Mr. Cusick produced the time file I think

         20    around March of 2018.  Like I said, it was up through the

         21    date of filing of the complaint.  So June 6'ish was --

         22    everything post that was attorney/client privilege and

         23    work product.

         24             So April -- we were given the case mid-March.  We

         25    realized there was an outstanding issue with respect to




                                                                       10



          1    the PMQ notices.  Plaintiff re-served the PMQ notices that

          2    were served in January, and we saw them in March.  We

          3    timely filed objections to those.  We went for mediation.

          4    Plaintiff had notice of depositions of the PMQ for April

          5    17th.  I was at both of those hearings.  After the

          6    mediation concluded we said Mr. Merrill, if you would like

          7    to take the deposition of Miss Wilkinson, she's here.  She

          8    will give testimony for all twelve of those notices.  We

          9    will produce the claim file as we received it from

         10    Mr. Cusick, with the privilege log.  So we put all of that

         11    together between five o'clock on April 16th, and I think

         12    probably by nine o'clock p.m. Mr. Merrill had the claim

         13    file and detailed privilege log.  We went to the depo on

         14    April 17th, Miss Wilkinson had dealt with eleven out of

         15    the twelve notices.

         16             MR. MERRILL:  There's a disconnect.

         17             MS. ELLIS:  (Unintelligible.)

         18             MR. MERRILL:  There's a disconnect and it's this,

         19    they have no right to raise any objection to what was

         20    ordered by the court.  No right to submit a privilege log.

         21             MS. BURKE:  I understand that's your position,

         22    Charlie.  We don't need to spend too much time on that.

         23    I'm trying to understand in reading -- I just rewind on

         24    what you said to make sure that -- did you say that the

         25    claim file was produced by Cusick in March of 2018 or did




                                                                       11



          1    you mean 2019?  And I just want to make sure I'm getting

          2    the chronology correct.

          3             MS. ELLIS:  I believe it was March of 2018.  So

          4    that plaintiff had this in their possession for well over

          5    a year before the notices were served in January.

          6             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

          7             MR. MERRILL:  The claim file was only until June

          8    of '17.

          9             MS. BURKE:  No.  When did you receive it from

         10    Mr. Cusick?

         11             MR. MERRILL:  I would have to go look.

         12             But the claim file we got from him was only

         13    through June of 2017.

         14             MS. BURKE:  Sure.  And that would be consistent

         15    with what Anne Marie is saying, that it was produced up to

         16    the commencement of litigation, correct?

         17             MR. MERRILL:  Yeah.  I don't know when he sent it

         18    in.

         19             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         20             MS. ELLIS:  And thereafter, Miss Burke, just to

         21    clarify, plaintiffs met and conferred and they asked, for

         22    example, the claim file notes, which we produced on June

         23    27th, which we only redacted for purpose -- any privileged

         24    information.  We served a detailed privilege log

         25    therewith.




                                                                       12



          1             On July 11th we produced the remainder of the

          2    claim file that was post June 6th, 2017 through the

          3    present, with another detailed privilege log.  So -- and

          4    that was maybe about 900 pages, many of them were

          5    duplicative, just in different places, so to speak, of

          6    what had been previously produced.

          7             MS. BURKE:  Just to make sure.

          8             When you're saying you produced additional stuff

          9    in June and July, that's 2019 then, correct?  That's you

         10    guys?

         11             MS. ELLIS:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And it was --

         12             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         13             MS. ELLIS:  And as I understand it was post what

         14    Mr. Cusick had produced.  So if he got --

         15             MS. BURKE:  Got it.

         16             MS. ELLIS:  Yes.  6 of '17 the complaint was

         17    filed.  We went through the remainder of the claim file

         18    and produced from the date he filed up to the present

         19    date.  And that included invoices, included the claims --

         20    included some emails, it included the claim file notes, et

         21    cetera.

         22             THE COURT:  Okay.  Got it.

         23             Okay.  So while we're on this sanction court

         24    order motion, Charlie, just for you, question for you.  I

         25    mean you had requested a couple of different -- there's




                                                                       13



          1    three different sanctions on this.  And I just want to

          2    understand how you believe the sanction request is

          3    specifically tailored to the harm that you're saying that

          4    you guys have suffered by the alleged, you know, discovery

          5    abuse here, the failure to comply with the order.  And I'm

          6    not saying that I agree that there is a failure to comply,

          7    you know, I'm just trying to make sure I understand how

          8    you feel that this is tailored to that, which is what I

          9    think that board case requires.

         10             MR. MERRILL:  Yes.  What we have is a discovery

         11    order dealing with their methodology, qualification and

         12    workup as to one, business personal property loss; and

         13    two, business income loss.  Almost -- virtually most of

         14    the discovery that has been ordered had to do with how

         15    they calculated and worked it up.  They're withholding

         16    vital and key information on purpose as to both areas,

         17    business personal property and business income loss.  They

         18    have failed purposely to comply with the court order.

         19             To try and seek further orders to comply is

         20    pointless, in my opinion, because I have asked for this.

         21    I didn't document it.  They have taken the position that

         22    they don't have to give it up.  And if they're not going

         23    to give up the work product and documentation in their

         24    files as to how they calculated business income and

         25    business personal property, then they should not be able,




                                                                       14



          1    to present evidence regarding these things.  There is

          2    really nothing else to do.

          3             I can fairly easily quantify or circumstantially

          4    it's very clear.  They went to Miss Stencil in late 2018

          5    to workup the business income loss.  She came up with

          6    numbers, but they are hiding those.  And they took the

          7    position that there is no further business income loss.

          8    So for them to now come forward and produce income

          9    testimony as to business income loss puts us at a terrible

         10    disadvantage just because of their intentional unlawful

         11    conduct.  That's how -- that why it's appropriate.

         12             Now, if you were to fashion an order, I couldn't

         13    argue with an order that says okay, they didn't supply the

         14    documents for business income and PPP, but if they supply

         15    those documents in five days, then the sanctions or the

         16    attorney's fees for all of this were awarded, but if they

         17    don't then you issue -- you issue sanctions.

         18             So that's why I think they are tied together.

         19             I'm done.

         20             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  And let me -- Anne Marie,

         21    kicking this back to you.  And I know this is somewhat

         22    unfair because you guys weren't involved at the time, but

         23    before this discovery order number two was sent to the

         24    court, and there was a representation that there was no

         25    objection to the discovery order, up until that time are




                                                                       15



          1    you aware of any assertion of attorney/client privilege

          2    with regard to any of these documents by prior counsel?

          3             MS. ELLIS:  Well, I believe that Mr. Cusick did

          4    file an objection.  Let me see here.  It was actually in

          5    the appendix that Mr. Merrill has.

          6             MS. BURKE:  Yeah, I saw that.  And my impression

          7    of that was that it wasn't actually filed.  At this point

          8    it was submitted after the court has ordered production of

          9    this stuff, and after everyone on your side said well, you

         10    know, Mr. Cusick has basically said there is no objection

         11    to this.  So I question the effects of this.  If it's just

         12    something that's floating out there that's not

         13    specifically going to the court, to somehow try to

         14    retroactively challenge the production of those documents.

         15             MS. ELLIS:  I -- I am pretty sure -- and I'm just

         16    looking through the appendix right now -- oh, yes, here it

         17    is.

         18             Let's see.  Okay.  So it was the Exhibit 30, it

         19    was served the 24th from Mr. Cusick.  And it represents

         20    that defendants have no further documents to produce in

         21    response to the below stated categories.  We produced

         22    responses to non privileged documents.

         23             And then number two says, to the extent that this

         24    request calls for privileged documents on the privilege

         25    log, provided with earlier production, defendants will




                                                                       16



          1    update the privilege log and provide it to plaintiff.

          2             And then there is an email substantiating that

          3    there was an agreement to produce the witness March 28th

          4    and 29th.  And then plaintiff re-served those notices

          5    sometime mid-March.  And then we got involved and then

          6    timely objected to those notices for the 12 PMQ's.  That

          7    was 3-28 notice of depo for the April 17th date.

          8             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  And so, Charlie, what's your

          9    impression of what that Exhibit 30 is?  I'm trying to

         10    figure out whether there was an affirmative --

         11             MR. MERRILL:  What day was discovery two entered,

         12    please?

         13             MS. BURKE:  It's February of -- I'm going to have

         14    to pull it up -- no.  It's late February.  Hold on a sec.

         15    I know it's in everybody's exhibits but...

         16             MR. MERRILL:  Yeah.  We have February 7th of

         17    discovery order two.

         18             MS. BURKE:  Yeah.  That would have been the

         19    date -- let me just look at something here.  That was the

         20    date I sent it to the court.  The court signed it February

         21    15th.

         22             MR. MERRILL:  So we get this issued for -- not

         23    even filed -- on February 24th after everything was

         24    already over.  And there was never a privilege log.  And

         25    then he never objected -- there is an email somewhere in




                                                                       17



          1    here that says we're not going to object to the order.

          2             So my opinion --

          3             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

          4             MR. MERRILL:  -- it is totally irrelevant.  After

          5    the fact doesn't matter.  And they have a requested

          6    relief.

          7             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Let me just look at my notes

          8    really quick here and make sure I'm done with this part of

          9    it.

         10             Oh.  One thing that I would like to request,

         11    Charlie, maybe your folks could send me, is a copy of the

         12    original set of discovery.  All of this stuff that is --

         13    that I'm looking at here is set number two and set number

         14    three, can you just send me because I don't have it, the

         15    original set of discovery that plaintiff responded to that

         16    Penn-Star propounded on -- I'm assuming it's request for

         17    interrogatories and Request for production and maybe

         18    request for admissions.

         19             MR. MERRILL:  Hold on.

         20             Lynn, do you have that?

         21             MS. APPLETON:  Yeah, we can send it.

         22             MS. BURKE:  Yeah.  It is not a rush.

         23    Realistically I'm not going to have a chance to look at

         24    this until early next week anyway, but I did want to look

         25    at that, kind of for context.




                                                                       18



          1             MR. MERRILL:  Okay.  So the discovery responded

          2    to was Cusick.

          3             MS. BURKE:  Yeah.  Yeah.

          4             MR. MERRILL:  Okay.  Easily done.

          5             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Then I want to move -- I

          6    guess, let me just ask for comment from kind of both sides

          7    here, starting with -- starting with Penn-Star because

          8    Charlie kind of has the last word on this, I think, with

          9    regard to this motion for sanctions.  And then I want to

         10    move away from the motion for sanctions to the credit

         11    cross motions on the discovery.

         12             So, Anne Marie, anything else you guys think that

         13    it is important that I consider with regard to this court

         14    order enforcement motion for sanctions?

         15             MS. ELLIS:  Sure.

         16             I would say that by re-serving the exact same

         17    notices on March 28th, and having a timely objection to

         18    those, and expedited production, and the detailed

         19    privilege log the same day, that the issue is moot.  And

         20    plaintiff -- there really is no prejudice, there is no

         21    harm, and they waited way too long to bring such a motion.

         22    And if you allow me to, after this hearing I will send you

         23    some authority on that.

         24             And then further, during the deposition of

         25    Miss Wilkinson, we talked about -- because of the




                                                                       19



          1    expedited production -- a clawback agreement for any

          2    privileged information.  And Mr. Merrill agreed on the

          3    record that he would agree to that.  That is page nine

          4    through, I think, eleven of the depo, which I can send

          5    you, if you need it.

          6             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

          7             MS. ELLIS:  And obviously we disagree with the

          8    request for sanctions.  And it's completely unfounded and

          9    unwarranted.

         10             MS. BURKE:  Charlie, what was -- what's the

         11    purpose of discussing the clawback -- clawback agreement

         12    at the depo?

         13             MR. MERRILL:  The clawback was something -- it

         14    was ordered by the court because you would have had

         15    documents -- and this is where we have a bit of a rub --

         16    was because on the when it was settled, or the 22nd, or

         17    whenever the judge signed it, they are producing stuff

         18    that is after the date of the order, they can claw it

         19    back.

         20             Additionally, if there ends up being personal

         21    statements, craft jokes, or some of the stuff that just

         22    comes out of a file -- understand, they showed up with

         23    just one of -- one of those things that you plug into a

         24    computer, a memory stick.  You don't know what's going to

         25    come up.  And I had not interest in embarrassing




                                                                       20



          1    Miss Wilkinson or anyone else if they had things in there

          2    that were personal or whatever, they are not relevant to

          3    the case.  And that's the purpose of the clawback.

          4             MS. ELLIS:  Well, I will send you what was on the

          5    record for that.

          6             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  That's fine.  That's fine.

          7             MS. ELLIS:  And let me --

          8             MS. BURKE:  We talked a few times here about

          9    stuff that, you know, it strikes me that maybe, you know,

         10    doing a supplemental, just to really -- really brief

         11    supplemental, like if you have some other authority or

         12    something else, nothing huge, you know, if you could get

         13    it to me by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.  That would

         14    be great.

         15             MR. MERRILL:  For us or for them?

         16             MS. BURKE:  Well, so far only Anne Marie has said

         17    that she wants to give me some, you know, supplemental

         18    maybe case authority or what not.  So if it turns out that

         19    there is something that you think that I need, that would

         20    apply to you too.

         21             MR. MERRILL:  Thank you.

         22             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  So I want to move on to the

         23    motion for protective order, you know.  And, Anne Marie,

         24    I'm just curious -- during -- during the meet and

         25    confer -- and actually I think Harry is probably the one




                                                                       21



          1    that was more involved in this -- but during, you know,

          2    that meet and confer time period that I requested you guys

          3    do in June, was there ever any agreement by Penn-Star to

          4    limit any of the discovery that has been propounded on the

          5    plaintiff.  I mean if there was, I didn't see it.

          6             MR. MERRILL:  There was.

          7             MS. BURKE:  It's possible I missed something.

          8             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  There was a written proposal by

          9    me, Miss Burke.  And we seem to be talking past each

         10    other.  We had the meet and confer on the 13th.  It was a

         11    lengthy conversation Charlie and I had.  I sent him a

         12    detailed email at the end of the day.

         13             The proposal was, first of all, let's get the

         14    Greg Gary Gomes batch out of the way.  Charlie had

         15    dismissed on the record, with prejudice, the trial setting

         16    conference on May 29th, Mr. Gomes from the case.  Good

         17    move.  It eliminated not half because it was not exactly

         18    half, but a good number, probably between 35 and 40

         19    percent of --

         20             MR. MERRILL:  It was 108.

         21             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Okay.  So 108 of, whatever it

         22    was, the 800 retaliatory -- whatever you said that was,

         23    Charlie, whatever your motion styled, but it was that

         24    number to that individual.  He is no longer a party in the

         25    case.  We don't -- we don't propound written discovery to




                                                                       22



          1    non parties in cases, and we made that clear.

          2             With regard to other suggestions that I made, a

          3    suggestion that I made was why don't you move first,

          4    Charlie, to contention interrogatories, that is what do

          5    you intend to prove in the case, what do you rely upon.

          6    And very straightforward, they weren't complicated,

          7    requests for admissions.  Things like are these your tax

          8    returns.  Can you confirm that this is your claim for BPI.

          9    And can you confirm that this is your claim for BPP.

         10    These are trial-related, is this your proof, show us the

         11    nature of your proof.  And then if things were more

         12    detailed, we would stagger that on a 30-day basis, so that

         13    we would at least have that batch of discovery.

         14             There has only been a handful of prior written

         15    discovery responses from plaintiff.  This was more of a

         16    supplemental, we are going to trial, supplement your

         17    proof, supplement the things that you intend to rely upon

         18    for trial.  Let's move to documents, because that seemed

         19    to be a sticking point too.

         20             I'm an old school guy.  I remember the days

         21    before the discovery act had zip codes attached to them

         22    that are ten digits longs.  I remember 2032, I think it

         23    was (d), maybe it was (e), that dealt with document

         24    production requests where, like the federal rules, we had

         25    an approach where a party -- and we had actually proposed




                                                                       23



          1    this on our side as well -- a party may produce documents

          2    that are maintained in the ordinary course of business as

          3    they are maintained.  And if they are cataloged and in a

          4    category, this is our ledger, this is our accounts ledger,

          5    this is our receipts ledger, this is our inventory ledger.

          6    If they are in categories that are fair and

          7    understandable, if you produce them in that format, as

          8    suggested in my meet and confer written response, I could

          9    look at them, produce those records in that way, and if

         10    I've got supplemental specifications to ask for, I will

         11    ask for them.

         12             So that was a proposal that we made to cut down

         13    on the bulk of respond to these 3765, whatever they were,

         14    specific categories of documents.

         15             The problem seems to be -- and maybe it is

         16    because Charlie and I are both a little bit old school --

         17    that in the ten days or so that followed, we seemed to be

         18    talking past each other with regard to these proposals.

         19    Charlie had agendas about what he was prepared to do.  I

         20    kind of stuck with the proposal that I had made during our

         21    meet and confer -- and it's in writing, so anybody can

         22    read it, and it is attached to our written papers.  Those

         23    were the proposals.  And we never got back to them.

         24             But to Charlie's credit though, eventually, maybe

         25    eight weeks later, we did get documents.  Oh boy, did we




                                                                       24



          1    get documents.  We got the fire hose of documents.  And

          2    they have been produced here now in the last three or four

          3    weeks.

          4             So we had a session where we copied those things.

          5    But the thing that we were looking for primarily was

          6    what's called the W files, QuickBooks file, which is the

          7    electronic records that for businesses that use

          8    QuickBooks, it's their basically -- it's their electronic

          9    equivalent of an old school ledger.  It's what the

         10    bookkeepers in the ordinary course of business intake,

         11    outgo, you manage a paper flow.

         12             We have a conference call, this predates our meet

         13    and confer, it predates our discovery request.  On April

         14    the 23rd we had a six-way phone call -- we had

         15    Miss Stencil and Mr. Sapos, the adjuster accountant for

         16    the plaintiff.  We asked Mr. Sapos pointblank, give us the

         17    source documents, including the QuickBooks W file that you

         18    relied upon in preparing your loss of claim proof of loss.

         19    And pointblank he said it's available, but you don't need

         20    it.

         21             Now, the representation was it was available.

         22    The representation was it could have been sent to us with

         23    the flip of a switch or in a thumb drive, as we had

         24    produced the claims file earlier.  It was not a heavy lift

         25    to do that.  We just did get that with the production that




                                                                       25



          1    we just received.  That would have been a good start at my

          2    meet and confer suggestions offered that as a good start.

          3    Let's go to the point where we were on April 23rd with

          4    Mr. Sapos proposing that he could simply provide us with

          5    an electronic set of whatever it was he relied upon, we

          6    could start there.

          7             It would be a good start.  But here we are and

          8    it's weeks later, and fortunately -- and I think

          9    Miss Ellis could probably speak to this better than I

         10    can -- we now have gotten beyond that start.  We now have

         11    a lot of those records.  They are meaningful.  Charlie

         12    talks about things like BPI and BPP, and what Miss Stencil

         13    was doing in 2018.  Wow.  We can go all of the way to

         14    2019.  We can move this case forward because they are

         15    enlightening.  We have a great deal more information than

         16    we ever had before and yes, it is useful.  And yet I think

         17    we are probably a long way toward that cataloguing, and

         18    perhaps asking for supplemental specifications if we need

         19    them.

         20             And Miss Ellis can probably fill us in on where

         21    we are in that process because now we have had twenty or

         22    so days to actually work with the files.

         23             MS. ELLIS:  Sure.

         24             So just to confirm now, we did pick up eighteen

         25    boxes from the plaintiff's office to be made available.




                                                                       26



          1    They were not categorized in any manner.  It took our

          2    people almost (unintelligible) at a cost of $15,000.  We

          3    provided a courtesy copy of all -- everything pdf and Bate

          4    stamped to the plaintiff's counsel.

          5             At this point we have not even been able to

          6    adequately catalogue them to see if it has what plaintiff

          7    purports, you know, sending, which is a backup QBW files.

          8             But as it relates to discovery, you know, I sent

          9    out, you know, after reviewing the motion, trying to

         10    delete some of the ones that plaintiffs thought were

         11    obstructive or intrusive.  Here's where, I think, where we

         12    stand.  That we have no information on this company called

         13    Hex Veneers that plaintiff is or Mr. Gomes is essentially

         14    running in conjunction with Natsu.  That was asked for in

         15    written discovery.

         16             We -- Mr. Sapos referenced that 2000 just for

         17    sale invoices.  We have not seen those.  We have no

         18    contention interrogatories.  We had to file a motion for

         19    summary judgment on April -- I'm sorry -- on August 16th.

         20    We had no discovery with respect to punitive damages

         21    allegations.

         22             So those are some of the buckets that we are

         23    asking plaintiff to respond to.  You know, we sort of

         24    received the document dump, but it's sort of unclear at

         25    this point when you don't have a clear or accurate




                                                                       27



          1    verification, and no RFP that it's responding to.  We are

          2    sort of just guessing what plaintiff is responding to.  So

          3    if we tried to narrow the request and these are the

          4    buckets that we're looking for -- and just to remind

          5    Miss Burke -- Exhibit 15 was Mr. Chamberlain's letter to

          6    Mr. Merrill on June 27th outlining the proposals.

          7             MS. BURKE:  Right.

          8             And it just seems to me -- and I need to go back

          9    and reread it -- but it seems to me that that letter was

         10    really basically an offer to kind of phase things, but

         11    didn't necessarily agree to withdraw or take anything off

         12    the table.  It was kind of more like, you know, we're

         13    going to save this.  But I will go back and reread that.

         14             I guess my other question which is tied directly

         15    into that particular letter, which I think is the genesis

         16    of what I don't really understand as being a deadline.

         17    But where exactly is there any agreement or any

         18    requirement that plaintiff is going to provide responses

         19    to everything by June 30th or they will have waived, you

         20    know, their objections and is subject to a motion to

         21    compel?  Because I -- my email said I wanted you guys to

         22    meet and confer through the end of the month, and then we

         23    get together and talk about a briefing schedule.

         24             So am I missing something where plaintiff agreed

         25    to provide responses by June 30th?




                                                                       28



          1             MS. ELLIS:  Well, in Mr. Chamberlain's June 23rd

          2    email he references June 30th.  And, you know, plaintiff

          3    never disagreed with that.  I will say though that we have

          4    essentially strung along with plaintiff not even telling

          5    us what they believe is overbroad and, you know, unduly

          6    burdensome.  I think they just don't want to respond to

          7    written discovery.  And so there has really been no

          8    attempt to comply at all.  And now we have discovery

          9    served in May, and now here we are three or four months

         10    later without any responses.  And no attempt really by

         11    plaintiff stating this is what I'm willing to do, other

         12    than essentially giving us, you know, three to five

         13    documents out.

         14             But I think that the Chamberlain letter

         15    suggesting June 30th really is where I'm taking that from.

         16             MS. BURKE:  But if I recall correctly, that was a

         17    suggestion basically coined to the question like does June

         18    30th sound reasonable.  And it was specifically in

         19    reference to the form interrogatories, not the rest of the

         20    discovery.

         21             So I just want to make sure I didn't miss

         22    something that set a deadline.

         23             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yeah.  Well, let me be clear so

         24    that I -- because like I can give you my state of mind as

         25    to the status --




                                                                       29



          1             MS. BURKE:  Sure.

          2             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  But the June 13 meet and

          3    confer -- and I wanted to do it fresh because I thought

          4    Charlie and I were having a productive dialogue.  It

          5    didn't set any firm deadlines.  It was very, I thought,

          6    cordial and collegial.  And Charlie sent me a different

          7    letter the following week, which seemed not to address any

          8    of those points.  And then sent me a follow-up letter to

          9    that letter about a week later that prompted my June 27th

         10    letter.  And my June 27th communique, so basically Charlie

         11    can you get back to the proposals that you made on this

         12    because we only have until June 30th to get the meet and

         13    confer thing wrapped up.

         14             So it wasn't -- I was not trying to be a hard

         15    case about June 30th and this is the actual deadline,

         16    you're going to fall off of a cliff.  It wasn't anything

         17    like that.  It was can we deal with these suggestions and

         18    I'll deal with yours too.

         19             MS. BURKE:  And I agree, Harry.  It wasn't -- it

         20    didn't seem to me to be heavy handed at all, which is why

         21    I'm kind of surprised that we get motions to compel saying

         22    that the objections are waived because no responses were

         23    provided, you know, on or before June 30th.  I was just

         24    confused by that.

         25             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  My -- my practice and my




                                                                       30



          1    approach, Miss Burke, as a lawyer for almost 40 years --

          2    and I know Charlie has been doing --

          3             (The telephone line was interrupted

          4             by a non-party speaker.  Brief break

          5             in the proceedings and a brief

          6             discussion off the record.)

          7             MS. BURKE:  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.

          8             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Oh, I'm sorry.

          9             MS. BURKE:  Wait, guys.  Wait.

         10             Let me put a pin in -- I'm not sure if Charlie

         11    and Miss Ellis --

         12             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yeah.  Let's be sure, please.

         13             MS. BURKE:  Charlie?

         14             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  I love technology.

         15             MS. BURKE:  That was so weird.  It's like the

         16    Chinese government is now tapping one of our phones.

         17             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Oh, that was scary.  No doubt.

         18    And there was kind of a lecturing to it.  It sounded very

         19    stern.

         20             MS. BURKE:  Very strange.

         21             All right.  Charlie?

         22             MR. MERRILL:  I'm here.

         23             MS. BURKE:  All right.  Harry, continue.

         24             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yes.  We put a pin in this.

         25    The court reporter, just before you came back on, we were




                                                                       31



          1    trying to get reminded where I was.  And I was droning on

          2    about almost being -- or almost a lawyer for 40 years.

          3             MR. MERRILL:  You already got through that part.

          4             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  And you probably a little bit

          5    longer.

          6             But, again, the old school thing.  I don't jump

          7    other lawyers with oh, my goodness, it's waived.  And gee,

          8    you didn't designate an expert, and so your case is over.

          9    The attorney/client privilege goes away, show me all your

         10    files because I really, really need to know.  That's not

         11    our practice.  I'm sure it's not Charlie's practice

         12    either.

         13             And so in terms of that, in terms of the

         14    substance of a motion for arguments like that, to the

         15    extent there's boilerplate or argument of that nature in

         16    our argument, it's not -- it doesn't have that cast to it.

         17             I could -- I suppose I could say some things

         18    about the February -- pre-February stuff about discovery

         19    order number two, but I'm not.  It's just not worth our

         20    time at this juncture because I don't think it's that

         21    productive.  I think --

         22             MR. MERRILL:  Are we talking about the discovery

         23    motion?  Are we done with the --

         24             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We are.

         25             MS. BURKE:  Yes.




                                                                       32



          1             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  And, Charlie, I was only using

          2    that as an example, as a prop.

          3             MR. MERRILL:  Yeah.  I think that's where you

          4    were going.

          5             MS. BURKE:  Yeah.

          6             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  To the extent you would like to

          7    get passed, I have the sense that you do, you would like

          8    to go get to the substance of discovery request, rather

          9    than all of the frills that go with a discovery motion,

         10    about are things waived and the consequences.  Yeah.  We

         11    can get past that too.

         12             That was not the tenor of the meet and confer

         13    exchange we had.  We are not trying to take a hard line.

         14    Perhaps we're being a little bit too much tit for tat with

         15    regard to, you know, our approach to some things.  And

         16    maybe it's just one of those overly enthusiastic things

         17    that we should look closely at our standard discovery

         18    motion so -- and assess.

         19             Charlie talked to me at length about the things

         20    he was prepared to do.  I'm sure that along the way I

         21    expressed some frustration with Charlie because I keep

         22    hearing how we are scorching the earth, but, my goodness,

         23    we have maybe a dozen written discovery responses previous

         24    from the plaintiff's side, and a handful of documents, and

         25    now we have much, much more.  And that's actually where we




                                                                       33



          1    need to be a few months prior to a trial.  So we're

          2    getting there.  And we're making progress by increments.

          3    But clearly it's not where I thought we should be as of

          4    two years ago.

          5             And that's the approach I was trying to take to

          6    this meet and confer.  We're going to go to trial on these

          7    five or six claims.  Okay.  What are the contentions?  Now

          8    that we are almost to trial, what are the documents relied

          9    upon?  Are you prepared to make these admissions?  And if

         10    you are not, well, then tell us why it is not valid to

         11    make certain admissions as to the authenticity of

         12    documents.  Simple facts about the values you claim,

         13    things like that.

         14             I think the discovery responses in terms of being

         15    retaliatory or even onerous are not that.  They are very

         16    straightforward discovery requests.

         17             MS. BURKE:  Well, I'd like to talk about some of

         18    the discovery requests here at some point, but I want to

         19    make sure I'm understanding -- as I understand it, the

         20    outstanding issues in the case are basically the method of

         21    calculation of the personal business property.  And then

         22    whether the business interruption is cutoff after the

         23    press is replaced.  I mean those are really the two key

         24    issues.

         25             Is there more to it than that in terms of issues




                                                                       34



          1    in this use that will drive this case?

          2             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  There is for the defense, very

          3    much --

          4             MR. MERRILL:  There is.

          5             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Charlie can -- Charlie can

          6    explain his side and I'll use my (unintelligible).

          7             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  I need --

          8             MR. MERRILL:  There is a method of calculation

          9    for business interruption.

         10             MS. BURKE:  Right.

         11             MR. MERRILL:  And there is also the bad faith

         12    component.  And all of the business interruption stuff, a

         13    lot of what they didn't use on business personal property

         14    goes to the bad faith case.  And they're hiding it.

         15    That's it.

         16             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Harry --

         17             MR. MERRILL:  Okay.

         18             MS. BURKE:  -- what else -- yeah -- what else

         19    from your perspective?

         20             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yeah.  Okay, Charlie.

         21             Well, gee golly, if Miss Stencil who was assigned

         22    to consult on the case in October of 2016, that would have

         23    been within forty days of the loss, and asked for specific

         24    things, like underlying documentation.  We have seen some

         25    tax returns which reflected acquisition of inventories in




                                                                       35



          1    the two years before the loss in roughly the mid $300,000

          2    range.

          3             MR. MERRILL:  Can you avoid as to what's needed.

          4             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Oh, I'm being specific,

          5    Charlie, about what was seen and what was needed.  This

          6    was needed years ago.  So if you're averaging in the mid

          7    300,000 of acquisition, and you take down for depreciation

          8    100 percent of your costs of sales for inventory every

          9    year, how is the inventory four times higher than that on

         10    the date of loss?  And there are many explanations for

         11    that that are possible, but at least the business

         12    documents, as they are kept in the ordinary course of

         13    business, give us a trail that might help to explain that.

         14             That also goes to the Hex Veneers, another

         15    business operated on the same premises.  Which has the

         16    sign on the door, it's actually Artistic Veneers sign on

         17    the door.  Is any of that their property?  Is any of that

         18    their actual loss that might be a factor with regard to

         19    the second clause that was seven months later.  We do have

         20    a baseline of information now about the inventories that

         21    were acquired from the date of this first fire in

         22    September of 2016 to the June 2017 fire.  And those

         23    numbers do correlate to about 300,000, $350,000 in

         24    acquired inventory on site at the premises for the year.

         25    We know that because we had a paid claim for all of the




                                                                       36



          1    inventory that was on the premises.  Seven months later,

          2    after whatever had been replaced had been replaced or not

          3    replaced, whatever was acquired at that time got paid for

          4    again.

          5             So yes, there are issues that bear upon that.

          6    That bear upon your methodology question, Charlie.  That

          7    bear upon your bad faith arguments, Charlie.  That bear

          8    upon these questions.  Which may have a simple business

          9    answer.  We have yet to get to them because we haven't

         10    deposed your party affiliated with Natsu, and we will have

         11    that opportunity pretty soon, now that we have the

         12    documents.

         13             MS. BURKE:  What is -- what is Hex Veneer?

         14    And -- I mean you say they are not a plaintiff in the

         15    case, what are they?

         16             MR. MERRILL:  Hex Veneer is the label.  I didn't

         17    know it was a business.  He put on doors he was making to

         18    try and survive.  So their bookkeeper put it under Hex.

         19    And those are doors -- I don't know all of the details --

         20    I think they sold them to Channel Lumber.

         21             So they are not furniture.  They're not board

         22    rooms.  He was simply making doors to sell to Channel

         23    Lumber and whoever else he sold them to.  That's my

         24    understanding.

         25             Mr. Gomes has been available for deposition for




                                                                       37



          1    well over a month, if not longer, and they wanted the

          2    documents before that, so I've done it.

          3             MS. BURKE:  I understand that.

          4             So did Hex Veneer -- did that entity exist before

          5    the fire loss or is this something that came about

          6    afterwards?

          7             MR. MERRILL:  After the fire loss.  He almost

          8    went out of business twice.  He did everything he could to

          9    try and stay in business.

         10             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         11             MR. MERRILL:  If I understand it, it's a cheaper

         12    product that he made just to get something out the door to

         13    keep the doors open.

         14             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         15             MR. MERRILL:  And I don't think it's a veneer.

         16    They may have a veneer on it.  I think he just called it

         17    Hex.  I don't know why.  I haven't discussed it with him a

         18    whole lot.

         19             MS. BURKE:  So, Harry, what is the Hex -- you've

         20    got a whole set of discovery that's dealing with Hex

         21    Veneer.  And I was trying to kind of dovetail into where I

         22    was going to move next.

         23             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Right.

         24             MS. BURKE:  So I was trying to understand how all

         25    of these questions about Hex Veneer reasonably calculated




                                                                       38



          1    to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

          2             MR. MERRILL:  Right.

          3             MS. BURKE:  Sorry about that.

          4             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Uh-oh.  It's the Chinese again.

          5             MS. BURKE:  Right.  I live with her.

          6             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  That's okay.  They're the

          7    important ones.

          8             It is one potential avenue in terms of business.

          9    And we will correlate in terms of the dates of relative

         10    loss, and the date of existence of Hex Veneer.  And we can

         11    certainly ask questions of Mr. Gomes now that we have

         12    documentation.

         13             That was one potential avenue to inquire.  What

         14    is Hex Veneer?  What materials does it use?  What has it

         15    acquired?  How is it that when somebody goes out and

         16    counts the number of boards for a -- what turns out to be

         17    a total loss of all inventory in stock on the premises,

         18    that based on acquisition cost, we should be looking at

         19    something in the 3- or $400,000 range.  As seven months

         20    later is borne out by a claim made by the exact same

         21    company, the exact same insured, to another insurance

         22    company for total loss of its inventory.

         23             That's the kind of loss that realistically should

         24    have been reflected.  And if there is another company

         25    doing business on the premises, which questions were asked




                                                                       39



          1    back in the day when the fire occurred, is that one

          2    potential source of what is Hex Veneers?  What is its

          3    business?  What property does it have located on the

          4    insured premises.

          5             And so that's why we are asking this question.

          6    It's not a mystery.  We're putting cards on the table

          7    about this.  And if it's one of Mr. Gomes' businesses,

          8    even if it's a lower scale, or a different brand, or a

          9    different commodity, I don't believe it's an insured.

         10             I've looked pretty closely at this policy, and I

         11    didn't see it on the policy.  And I didn't see it as part

         12    of the application.  And I didn't see it as part of the --

         13    of the -- of any of the sourcing information that we have,

         14    and we can correlate back through other means.  So we are

         15    asking that question.  It's a bigger sign on the door

         16    today than the current insured has.  Signage means

         17    something to me.

         18             MS. BURKE:  But it's --

         19             MR. MERRILL:  Let me respond real quick here

         20    because, number one, you have all of the books for the

         21    Hex.  Number two, if you want to say when did Hex Veneer

         22    go into business, we can say the answer is before X, Y, Z

         23    date, you can have some questions.

         24             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Okay.

         25             MR. MERRILL:  You got 800 things out there.  You




                                                                       40



          1    got stuff like what caused the fire.  What do you think

          2    caused the fire.  Tell me all of this stuff.  Tell me all

          3    of these questions about the bankruptcy when we gave you

          4    all of the bankruptcy documents.

          5             We've agreed to lodge with tailored questions.

          6    We have --

          7             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We agreed to --

          8             MR. MERRILL:  These are not tailored questions.

          9             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  The bankruptcy -- the

         10    bankruptcy deals with the acquisition.  That was one

         11    explanation that has been provided to us by Mr. Sapos.

         12    That we have all of this inventory because it was acquired

         13    in the bankruptcy.  So we are asking questions logically

         14    because they don't follow your books and records, Charlie.

         15    They don't.  They don't correlate with the bankruptcy

         16    file.

         17             MS. ELLIS:  Sorry.  We do not have any QBW files

         18    or tax returns for Hex.  Nothing has been provided on

         19    that.  It's only been --

         20             MS. BURKE:  Well, Hex -- Hex is not a plaintiff,

         21    right?  Hex is not a claimant.  Hex didn't even exist at

         22    the time of the fire, correct?

         23             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  That's a representation that

         24    Charlie -- wait a minute.  That's a representation that

         25    Charlie is making.




                                                                       41



          1             MR. MERRILL:  Well, if you want to send your

          2    investigators out to comb the neighborhood as a game, is

          3    it a vendor, is it -- other people -- do you have a

          4    picture of when you went out there before of the place

          5    that doesn't have a Hex sign?

          6             MS BURKE:  Wait --

          7             MR. MERRILL:  When the fire happened you had your

          8    guy out there for three days or two weeks, there was no

          9    Hex sign, was there?

         10             MS. BURKE:  And as a practical matter, there is

         11    no plaintiff named Hex Veneer, so they are not a claimant.

         12    So I just wanted to establish what they were, so that I

         13    understand what they are.

         14             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  They are a related business

         15    that is doing business on the same business premises.  And

         16    it may be, because we don't know, because we haven't been

         17    able to ask these questions yet, it may be an owner of

         18    some of the inventory, at least that inventory that was

         19    Hex's, what you would expect to be on the premises.

         20             But from looking at the actual books and records

         21    and tax returns of this insured -- and if someone, first

         22    party, third party, any party to a lawsuit has potentially

         23    relevant information to the claims that are being served

         24    by the plaintiff, and I think that's clearly relevant

         25    here, is what is the source of what was deposited at this




                                                                       42



          1    location.  Signs on the door or not.  What is the source

          2    of business inventory that's at a particular location.

          3    And this is one lead that discovery may allow us to

          4    pursue.  And we're simply asking questions because they

          5    are logical.

          6             MR. MERRILL:  They didn't know the inventory.

          7    And a bailee is not covered under the policy.

          8             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  You know what -- and it might

          9    be, Charlie.  I might get that answer, but I don't know

         10    what Hex is yet.  But you're going to tell me, aren't you?

         11    And that's why I'm asking questions.  It's called

         12    discovery.

         13             We are asking these questions.  We're asking you

         14    politely.  If you want to say perjuritively, oh, but that

         15    means you're calling my guy a crook, I wouldn't be calling

         16    your guy a crook if I did a UCC search, and it turned out

         17    that he factored all of his inventory.  And -- and Nations

         18    Bank, or Bank of America, or Bank of California owns 75

         19    percent of it.  That's what insurance companies have to

         20    do.  They couldn't write Hex Veneer or Natsu a check if

         21    that turns out to be the case.  That's just ordinary

         22    insurance loss adjustment.

         23             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Let me just intervene.

         24    There's one question that I have that you've reminded me

         25    of.




                                                                       43



          1             We're talking about Mr. Sapos.  And I understand

          2    that Penn-Star has objected to his declaration on various

          3    grounds.  I understand that.  And I will consider that.

          4             But just to the recitation within his

          5    declaration, he lays out a number of things that he says

          6    have been provided.

          7             Penn-Star folks do you guys disagree with that?

          8    In other words is there some line items in his declaration

          9    that he says he has provided that in fact you say no, we

         10    don't have that.

         11             Is there anything specific?

         12             MS. ELLIS:  This is Miss Ellis.

         13             Yes.  I think, first of all, is the 2018 tax

         14    returns, as I understand have not been finalized but

         15    probably should be soon if there is an extension.

         16    Mr. Sapos advised that there were almost 2000 purchase and

         17    sale invoices.  If plaintiff believes that they have

         18    produced that, then that should be in some kind of

         19    verified response because at this point it doesn't appear

         20    that we have those.  Information about cancelled jobs that

         21    we don't have.  And any of the basis for -- sorry -- the

         22    loss on hand -- the inventory on hand at the time of the

         23    loss.

         24             MR. MERRILL:  Wait a minute.

         25             Isn't it what -- didn't you just ask him what was




                                                                       44



          1    Miss Stencil when we were talking about this previously?

          2             MS. BURKE:  Yeah.  Basically it's, you know,

          3    there's that Sapos declaration.  And he iterates in there

          4    the things that he contends that he sent over either to

          5    Stencil or somebody else for Penn-Star, I don't remember.

          6             MR. MERRILL:  And we're talking about before the

          7    lawsuit's filed?

          8             MS. BURKE:  Whatever he says -- he says in there.

          9    I'm just trying to get an idea of what has been provided,

         10    and whether they disagree.

         11             MR. MERRILL:  Give me his declaration.

         12             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  There is, Miss Burke.  This is

         13    Harry again.

         14             MS. BURKE:  Yes.

         15             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  There is, Miss Burke, an easy

         16    cross reference for that.  Whatever was provided prior to

         17    the time the lawsuit was filed by Mr. Sapos to anyone

         18    because he is a public investor, would be contained in the

         19    claims file, which has 16,000 documents in it.

         20             And Anne Marie, you'll remind me how this

         21    information is catalogued.  It might just simply be

         22    correspondence, or it might simply be backup

         23    documentation, that kind of thing.

         24             So we do have a cross reference.  Now we have a

         25    double cross reference.  Now we have a double Bate stamped




                                                                       45



          1    copy of not only the claims file, which we produced when

          2    Miss Wilkinson -- the version that we believe is the

          3    complete claims file -- that Miss Wilkinson produced at

          4    her PMQ depositions in April.

          5             We also now have the 18 boxes from Mr. Merrill's

          6    office.  And we can do a cross reference, which we are

          7    doing right now.  But I think the big ticket items that

          8    Miss Ellis is talking about, one big ticket item I can

          9    think of, I know a document that we didn't have, which is

         10    easily produced, and I know we didn't have it because

         11    Mr. Sapos told me that we didn't have it, and we didn't

         12    need it, and that was the QBW file, which is an electronic

         13    file.

         14             That would have been very, very, very helpful to

         15    an accountant, to an adjuster, to a lawyer.  Even people

         16    who are not well versed because that is basically the

         17    insured's electronic ledger.

         18             MS. BURKE:  So now you do have that QBW file,

         19    correct?

         20             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Right.  Correct.

         21             MS. BURKE:  And wouldn't that QBW file also

         22    contain purchase and sale invoices and things of that

         23    nature that you're saying were not produced?

         24             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  It would if they were entered.

         25    If they were manly entered in the ordinary course of




                                                                       46



          1    business because that's how ledgers work.  It would

          2    have references to the things that are input.  It won't

          3    have the source data themselves.  The source data exists

          4    independently of a ledger, but at least we would know

          5    where it was.  At least as things came in, it would be

          6    referenced to the QuickBooks ledger.  And so we could then

          7    see the backup, if we needed to.

          8             That's why the QuickBooks -- the QuickBooks --

          9    the QBW file is kind of a Rosetta stone.  It sets us in

         10    the direction and it provides a point of reference where

         11    if we can sample, and then we can cross verify hundreds of

         12    items, thousands of items, then maybe we don't need to

         13    look further.  But that's why respectfully to Mr. Sapos,

         14    and we did respectfully respond to him on April 23rd in

         15    response to that, that is why we need to get it.  That's

         16    why any accountant, anybody who is fundamentally looking

         17    at any kind of loss that takes place after the fact would

         18    want to see what was being recorded by an insured in the

         19    ordinary course of business or any business to calculate

         20    business, losses.

         21             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         22             MR. MERRILL:  On June 28th, I saw those -- or

         23    right around then, when I got back from vacation -- I sent

         24    them what I thought was a whole QuickBooks file from

         25    2011 -- it turns out only ran through January 31st of




                                                                       47



          1    2018.  When it was brought to my attention that it was

          2    missing 2018 to '19, I sent that.  So they have had, since

          3    before July, the whole QuickBooks file.

          4             In answer to your question, Miss Ellis -- where

          5    he takes Miss Ellis to task because she misrepresented

          6    what wasn't said.  His declaration -- they have no -- they

          7    cannot say that all of the things in his declaration he

          8    said, which was long before the lawsuit started, were not

          9    received by Miss Stencil.  They objected to his

         10    declaration, but they did not say in the objection that

         11    any of those documents were supplied.

         12             This has been a continual problem because Stencil

         13    asked for a representative sample of things, and he gave

         14    them.  Then Miss Wilkinson and now Miss Ellis carries on

         15    and asks for all of these additional documents, and it's

         16    simply not true.

         17             Done.

         18             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         19             MS. ELLIS:  I was just --

         20             MS. BURKE:  Go ahead.

         21             MS. ELLIS:  If plaintiff feels strongly that

         22    Mr. Sapos has actually produced this documentation,

         23    perhaps he could just point us to a base range for each

         24    category.  But I know, as we sit here today, that the 2018

         25    tax returns are definitely important, and they have not




                                                                       48



          1    been sent to us yet.

          2             MR. MERRILL:  Miss Ellis, we are talking about

          3    before the lawsuit.  2018 have nothing to do with it.

          4    Because you got caught not telling the truth, you are now

          5    spinning that to 2018.  We're objecting --

          6             MS. ELLIS:  That's not true.

          7             MR. MERRILL:  -- for his declaration he supplied

          8    all of the documents before the lawsuit.  That's the

          9    question.

         10             MS. BURKE:  I think it is two separate questions.

         11    And I understand.

         12             And let me just clarify on the 2018 thing.

         13    Charlie, the 2018 tax returns, are those in the process of

         14    being finalized?  I mean I know you don't have to have

         15    them on file until October.

         16             MR. MERRILL:  They are still working on them.  I

         17    know my '18 is not filed.  I don't know what's going on

         18    with his.

         19             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         20             MR. MERRILL:  I don't have his tax returns.  It's

         21    not done.  I sent them '17.

         22             MS. BURKE:  Right.  Understood.  Okay.  Fair

         23    enough.

         24             MR. MERRILL:  They are not done.

         25             MS. BURKE:  Okay.




                                                                       49



          1             MR. MERRILL:  If they are done I will give them

          2    to them.

          3             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Okay.  Chill out.  I'm just

          4    asking.

          5             MR. MERRILL:  I'm sorry.

          6             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  So I want to talk a bit about

          7    the specific discovery.

          8             And, you know, I understand that some of this was

          9    withdrawn today.  I mean frankly that's really the kind of

         10    effort I was looking for as part of the meet and confer.

         11    And the fact is I went through all of this discovery as

         12    part of this motion, and withdrawing, you know, I don't

         13    know, maybe twenty, thirty percent, I haven't tallied it

         14    up, four hours before the motion, I kind of appreciate it.

         15    But I'm also just trying to get an understanding of really

         16    the basis for this discovery.  Because there's nary a

         17    representation in both the motion to compel, as well as

         18    the opposition for protective order, that the discovery,

         19    you know, being total all of it, including the stuff that

         20    was withdrawn this morning, was not carefully tailored,

         21    you know, presumably calculated to lead to the discovery

         22    of admissible evidence.  And I'm trying to get an idea of

         23    the thought pattern behind it.

         24             So, for example, if we look at the special

         25    interrogatories, you know, eighteen through twenty two,




                                                                       50



          1    which you guys have now withdrawn, how is this -- how was

          2    this discovery about how the incident occurred and all

          3    that?  How was that reasonably calculated to lead to the

          4    discovery of admissible evidence?

          5             MS. ELLIS:  Well, Miss Burke, I think just to

          6    back up, first of all, at the time this discovery was

          7    propounded we did have two parties.  We had Mr. Gomes

          8    erroneously sued as Mr. George, and then we had Natsu.

          9    Prior to this discovery being served, we had not gotten

         10    very sensitive responses from plaintiff.  Did not serve

         11    any subpoenas.  Did no basic understanding of how the

         12    accident occurred and some of just like the background

         13    information about --

         14             MS. BURKE:  Wait.

         15             But -- but weren't there like fire investigators

         16    and all of this kind of stuff?  I mean -- I'm not

         17    following.

         18             MS. ELLIS:  Well, before we got in the case there

         19    had been no subpoenas issued.  So we had not seen any of

         20    those documents related to the underlying fire

         21    investigation.

         22             So when we got into this case, early May we

         23    started issuing subpoenas for discovery.  I think -- and,

         24    you know, the representation that they were almost

         25    (unintelligible) the request I think is not accurate




                                                                       51



          1    because I think plaintiff counted all of the subparts in

          2    the form interrogatories.

          3             But, you know, as we sit here today, I think,

          4    like I said to you, I see contention interrogatories and

          5    the discovery related to the punitive damages from a

          6    written discovery standpoint are -- and the Hex in your

          7    discovery are really the core of what we're looking for.

          8    Yet, you know, and --

          9             MS. BURKE:  Well -- and I -- I understand that.

         10    But there was, you know, throughout the whole month of

         11    June and up to -- you know, up and including of filing of

         12    your motion, and then your opposition to plaintiff's

         13    motion, the position was that all of this information

         14    that's being asked for was tailored discovery that, you

         15    know, really critical.

         16             And so I'm just trying to make sure that I'm not

         17    missing some reason why some of this information is

         18    reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of

         19    admissible evidence.  I mean -- I guess by way of, you

         20    know, another example, you know, it's just -- when you're

         21    talking about other losses from January 2009 to the

         22    present, which is your interrogatory number 75, how is

         23    that, you know, how is that reasonably calculated to lead

         24    to the discovery of admissible evidence whether this

         25    person has had other losses?




                                                                       52



          1             MS. ELLIS:  Well, Miss Burke, I think the key

          2    issue that maybe you haven't been told about it, but there

          3    was a subsequent loss right after our claim, like six

          4    months later, June of 2017, that was never disclosed in

          5    any type of written discovery.  And so any other losses

          6    are certainly relevant to our claims.

          7             You know, we also had not had the benefit of and

          8    still have not had the benefit of deposing Mr. Gomes or

          9    Mr. Sapos or any other witnesses related to this incident.

         10    So coming from the perspective of, you know, where we were

         11    in May and where we are now, I think we have learned a

         12    lot.  But certainly prior losses, particularly any that

         13    occurred right around the time of the fire and after are

         14    certainly relevant.

         15             MR. MERRILL:  So that includes 2009 and '11, '12,

         16    '13.  Uh-huh.

         17             MS. ELLIS:  But I will say there was never any

         18    effort by plaintiff to say okay, I will take these ten,

         19    drop these ten form interrogatories and I'll respond to

         20    it.  It was just a constant dribble of delay, and delay,

         21    and delay.  And so at this point there has to be some

         22    responsibility on the plaintiff to assist in this process.

         23             MS. BURKE:  Well, I -- but what I saw in some of

         24    the meet and confer -- and, again, I will go back and look

         25    at Harry's -- that one letter that I think was June 14th




                                                                       53



          1    that I think initiated some of this.  But, you know, I see

          2    plaintiffs basically specifically offering to tailor

          3    plaintiff's discovery to you guys, and remove things, but

          4    I'm not seeing, you know, an offer to specifically remove

          5    discovery up until this morning.  And, again, through the

          6    whole motion practice here it's -- the position being

          7    taken is that all of this discovery was tailored

          8    specifically for this case.  And I'm just trying to

          9    understand why this discovery is reasonably calculated to

         10    lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  I mean, you

         11    know, the series of interrogatories that now I guess have

         12    been withdrawn about Wood Craft, and I don't understand

         13    who Wood Craft is but --

         14             MR. MERRILL:  They were the bankrupt.

         15             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         16             MR. MERRILL:  They filed in 2011.

         17             MS. BURKE:  There was a bankruptcy.

         18             Okay.  And so this is how you learned about their

         19    bankruptcy, and your relationship.  I don't know.  I mean

         20    it just seems like a lot of this is maybe not -- unless --

         21    again, unless I'm missing something, I just don't see how

         22    this is calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible

         23    evidence.

         24             MR. MERRILL:  Just so you understand Wood

         25    Craft --




                                                                       54



          1             MS. BURKE:  Yes.

          2             MR. MERRILL:  Wood Craft was brought -- he

          3    brought Wood Craft out of bankruptcy.  Bought their stuff

          4    for a hundred grand.

          5             MS. BURKE:  Right.

          6             MR. MERRILL:  It was twelve pages in total.

          7    There was no inventory.  Twelve pages in total for the

          8    bankruptcy court.  Mr. Sapos gave each of those twelve

          9    pages to Miss Stencil.  And she was --

         10             MS. BURKE:  Right.

         11             MR. MERRILL:  And she was satisfied.  And then

         12    now they are raising this.  And all of these questions

         13    with anything they had to ask we answered in the twelve

         14    pages we gave them, or it doesn't exist.  That's Wood

         15    Craft.

         16             I'm done.

         17             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Well, with due respect,

         18    Charlie, if we don't ask questions about the twelve pages,

         19    because we can't know what we don't know concerning Wood

         20    Craft, and the Wood Craft inventory, and whether that

         21    filled the gap between 350,000 or 300,000 and 1.2 million

         22    dollars claimed inventory, how do we know unless we ask

         23    the questions?

         24             Let's dial back a minute to claims, to insurance

         25    claims that deal with fire losses, including the prior




                                                                       55



          1    loss we did not know about seven short months after this

          2    one, which are overlapping -- you will forgive me, I know

          3    you and I disagree on this subject -- but they are

          4    overlapping because they involve --

          5             MR. MERRILL:  Well, let me --

          6             MS. BURKE:  Wait.

          7             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Charlie --

          8             MS. BURKE:  Charlie, let him finish.

          9             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  I'm addressing something that

         10    Miss Burke squarely addressed, and I think it's a fair

         11    question.

         12             Not only does the standard statutory form fire

         13    policy talk about coordination of loss benefits between

         14    two insurance companies where you're dealing with the same

         15    property, making it directly statutorily relevant under

         16    both policies, who pays what and when, you are

         17    specifically claiming your clients -- that there is a

         18    continuing stream of loss even after he goes back into

         19    business, even up to the present time, as I understand it,

         20    of business income loss.  This is income loss which he

         21    declared to another insurance company.

         22             And I know he doesn't intend to commit insurance

         23    fraud, he has told us so, and so have you, that he had no

         24    business income loss after post fire June 2017.  I would

         25    say that's directly relevant.  I think that's directly




                                                                       56



          1    relevant to a claim that he is continuing to make up

          2    through August of 2019 about business income loss.

          3             It's the same business.  It's the same income

          4    stream.  It's the same property.  It's the same operation.

          5    It's actually the same kind of loss.

          6             And how would we know, because he didn't tell us

          7    about this one either, neither did Mr. Sapos, and he

          8    didn't tell us that there was another recovery of another

          9    $175,000 for lost business inventory, without business

         10    income loss because he had none.  That's what he told that

         11    insurance company.

         12             MR. MERRILL:  Is it my turn now?

         13             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  How would we know?

         14             Yes.

         15             How would we know that there wasn't another

         16    claim, I don't know, in 2013, 2014, 2015 that might have

         17    borne upon this.  I know there's a subsequent claim in

         18    2017.  It's a woodworking business.  I appreciate that

         19    because my family is in that business.  That fires happen

         20    in woodworking businesses.  I get it.  I understand.

         21    That's why there's fire insurance.  That's why we're

         22    asking those questions.

         23             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         24             MR. MERRILL:  Is it my turn?

         25             MS. BURKE:  Yes, Charlie.  Respond.




                                                                       57



          1             MR. MERRILL:  Let me go back in history when I

          2    was a young attorney.  No.  I will skip forward to

          3    September of 2016.  They hired adjusting companies.  They

          4    came in and said the fire was the result of the hot press,

          5    which was on fire.  They sent in their adjusters.  In

          6    October of '16 the experts for Penn-Star and Global

          7    Indemnity said ah-ha the cause and origin is the hopper

          8    hot press.

          9             So let me ask you these sage, and well thought

         10    out discovery requests.  Number one, what's the cause of

         11    the fire?  Number two, what do you think is the cause of

         12    the fire?  That's how well thought out they are.

         13             Now, as far as the second incident, another unit

         14    in the building caught on fire and the water came down.

         15    It flooded.  You've got a business, if I recall, three

         16    days.  There was no inventory damage, but if there was

         17    any -- any veneer inventory, Mr. Schultz, the same person

         18    they hired before, was there.  And Mr. Chamberlain was at

         19    his deposition.  And Mr. Schultz testified no, there was

         20    no inventory for which he was paid that was damaged by the

         21    flood.

         22             MS. BURKE:  And so --

         23             MR. MERRILL:  I said --

         24             MS. BURKE:  Wait.  Stop.

         25             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Charlie --




                                                                       58



          1             (Multiple speakers speaking at the

          2             same time, cannot be heard by the

          3             reporter.)

          4             MS. BURKE:  Stop.  Who is Schultz?

          5             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Schultz is an estimator who

          6    works for a company called Greer & Kirby.  He is actually

          7    a very busy fellow these days.  Mr. Schultz operates a

          8    local office of an insurance loss estimation company

          9    called Greer & Kirby, who is subcontracted quite often in

         10    cases like this.  He actually goes out and counts things

         11    and inventory things.

         12             And since we are talking about inventory losses,

         13    two losses, the prior loss in September 2016.  You're

         14    right, Charlie, I was there at the deposition.  I did get

         15    a chance to cross examine and discuss this with

         16    Mr. Schultz, who counted up every door, every cord, every

         17    piece of wood concerning the September 2016 fire loss.

         18    And as far as he knew that was all then out of the

         19    building by 2017.  And yes, he did have inventory loss

         20    because his entire inventory that was in the yard on that

         21    lot that got flooded -- it all got flooded and it all got

         22    paid for.  And the cross correlation there is in six

         23    months how much new inventory can you put up on pallets in

         24    your exact same business, operating a core veneer press,

         25    the same core veneer press you were operating in September




                                                                       59



          1    of 2016, put it up on the stacks, and if it gets totally

          2    lost, how much is that worth.  And the answer is a whole

          3    lot less 1.2 million dollars.  Especially since you

          4    processed all of that inventory, according to your own

          5    business records, you process all of your inventory on an

          6    annual basis, depreciating it down to virtually zero.  In

          7    other words you use all of the cores that you bring into

          8    your property.

          9             So that does make a difference.  Yeah.  I think

         10    Mr. Schultz is a very good witness.  Maybe not so much for

         11    the reason you guys think so.  He basically says he did

         12    different lots.  He looked at different lots.  They looked

         13    like different pieces of property.  So he's assuming he

         14    would make the assumption that this must be new stock.

         15    This must be stock that was replaced between the time of

         16    the first fire and the time of the second fire.  But

         17    inventory loss was very much paid by Seneca to the tune of

         18    $175,000.

         19             MR. MERRILL:  And Mr. Schultz is -- I wasn't at

         20    the depo.  There was new inventory.  I was wrong.  It was

         21    new inventory.  So I apologize.  I wouldn't misspeak to my

         22    brethren.

         23             However, Mr. Schultz is the one that told

         24    Miss Wilkinson that the loss was over 1.2 million dollars

         25    and recommended that for reserves.  And that's from the




                                                                       60



          1    September fire.  That was Mr. Schultz.

          2             I'm done.

          3             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  All right.

          4             So just going back to the special

          5    interrogatories, I'm trying to figure out why towards the

          6    end of the special interrogatories here, what --

          7    interrogatory 100 and 101, why is the number of employees,

          8    you know, and their identity -- I guess the number of

          9    employees they have then and they have now, why is that

         10    calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible

         11    evidence?

         12             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Well, it's operation -- it's

         13    operating expenses, if it's bigger or smaller staff.  And,

         14    again, we are not only projecting for three or four weeks

         15    that it takes to repair and replace a press to get a

         16    business back up and running a business.  That's business

         17    interruption or business income loss under standard fire

         18    policy.

         19             We are going up to present day.  So these are

         20    damages calculations.  So we are asking this business,

         21    snapshot in time 2016, when this fire occurred, how many

         22    employees on the books.  How much payroll.  How much

         23    inventory.  How much expense today, when you're still

         24    claiming business income loss.  When you're claiming that

         25    you lost a net profit from your operations, and it's all




                                                                       61



          1    because of this fire.  What does your business operation

          2    look like today.  And that is the basic questions that you

          3    don't necessarily get from the books and records.  You

          4    have to ask the question.

          5             MS. BURKE:  So the question in your mind is

          6    basically is the business back up and running sort of.

          7             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Exactly.  It's what does the

          8    business look like today in 2019, as opposed to what it

          9    looked like then, to the extent that you're claiming all

         10    of these lost profits for a business that's a going

         11    concern.  And that's a going concern calculation that

         12    any -- any business valuation expert, any business

         13    interruption, any business income expert would need in

         14    order to be able to compute that.  Mr. Sapos included, I

         15    presume, because I'm going to ask him those questions.

         16             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Let me ask another question.

         17             When I'm looking at your interrogatory -- special

         18    interrogatory number 68 here, and I understand -- again,

         19    this is one of the ones that you have now withdrawn -- but

         20    the whole motion is premised on -- your motion to compel

         21    is premised on the motion that all of these

         22    interrogatories are tailored for this claim.  And I'm just

         23    wondering how long has he been in the veneer industry, how

         24    is that calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible

         25    evidence?




                                                                       62



          1             MS. ELLIS:  Well, I think it's relevant to

          2    understand his business.  To understand what he does.  How

          3    long he has been doing it, because now he is also

          4    apparently in the door business.  You know, some of these

          5    were withdrawn specifically because now we have a date

          6    from Mr. Gomes's depo on September 16th that has been

          7    agreed to by all parties.

          8             So by withdrawing these, they are not an

          9    admission that they were not served in good faith, but

         10    that we now simply have another source to ask some of

         11    these questions.  So some of these were geared toward

         12    understanding the business, you know, from a big global

         13    perspective.

         14             MS. BURKE:  Let me ask the question in context of

         15    that Gomes deposition.

         16             Are you guys planning to re-serve the request for

         17    production on Mr. Gomes, similar to what you guys had

         18    served for his initial deposition notice?

         19             MS. ELLIS:  We have.  But we will tailor that

         20    based on your ruling, and based on these agreements

         21    withdrawn.

         22             MR. MERRILL:  Yeah.  I said 108 document

         23    requests -- we agreed with the date, and then they sent

         24    the notice of deposition, and then with that came 108

         25    document requests.




                                                                       63



          1             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We served them prior.

          2             MS. BURKE:  Go ahead, Harry.

          3             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yeah.  We re-served a prior

          4    notice of deposition.

          5             But in light of the fact that we now have

          6    documents that we can now see, that we now have categories

          7    for, even though we're providing the categories.  Yeah.  I

          8    think it's not only a fair bet, but I will give you this

          9    representation.  Yes.  Miss Ellis is correct.  We can very

         10    much tailor down that.  But at the time these motions were

         11    made, at the time we were meeting and conferring, Charlie,

         12    that wasn't the case.  We didn't have that in hand.  We

         13    didn't have --

         14             MR. MERRILL:  You said that.

         15             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We didn't have thousands --

         16             MR. MERRILL:  You sent the depo notice last week.

         17             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Fine.

         18             MR. MERRILL:  You had the QuickBooks for two

         19    months.

         20             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  And we still do not have -- I'm

         21    not comfortable that we have a baseline of information

         22    that is fulsome and complete, although I think we're

         23    getting there.  Maybe Anne Marie can fill in the blanks a

         24    little bit more of that.

         25             I feel a little bit better about where we are now




                                                                       64



          1    twenty days post production.  Having been able to work

          2    with the files and actually having seen the files.  It

          3    would have been nice to have them earlier, I'll grant you,

          4    but I think that we have a lot more flexibility now than

          5    we had then back in June.

          6             MS. BURKE:  Let me ask the question.

          7             When is Gomes's deposition set for?

          8             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  The 18th.

          9             MS. ELLIS:  16th.

         10             MR. MERRILL:  16th of September.

         11             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yeah.

         12             MR. MERRILL:  Two weeks after labor day.

         13             MS. BURKE:  In September, okay.

         14             MR. MERRILL:  It's the 16th.

         15             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  The 16th, yes.

         16             MS. BURKE:  And have there been a document

         17    request submitted as part of that notice?  Is it basically

         18    the same document request that I'm looking at here?

         19             MR. MERRILL:  It's the same 108.

         20             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  That's what we're saying.  And

         21    I'm saying -- I'm representing to you, whether you do

         22    something about it or not -- I think Anne Marie would

         23    suggest that we wait to see how you rule, but I'm

         24    confident that we can pare that down.  Because now we have

         25    seen the documents.  Because now we know.




                                                                       65



          1             We are under the gun a little bit.  We have a

          2    trial date that's pending.  We have one shot at the very

          3    first deposition we're going to take -- this is the first

          4    deposition taken on the defense side of the case.

          5             So, all right.  Pare it down.  I don't have a

          6    problem with that at all.  You could probably pare it down

          7    substantially to -- especially these core requests that

          8    we're talking about today.

          9             MR. MERRILL:  Could have pared it down a week

         10    ago.

         11             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We might have, Charlie.  We

         12    didn't have a week to work with the documents until this

         13    week.

         14             MR. MERRILL:  You had the documents for two

         15    months.

         16             MS. BURKE:  All right.  I think I'm getting

         17    pretty close to wrapping up.

         18             But when I'm looking at your request for

         19    admissions here -- and if you wouldn't mind looking at

         20    request for admission 77 and 78, I'm just trying to

         21    understand that these are ones that have not been

         22    withdrawn.  You're asking them to admit that the sprinkler

         23    system and fire alarm system were not proper.

         24             How is that reasonably calculated to lead to the

         25    discovery of admissible evidence in this insurance claim?




                                                                       66



          1             MS. ELLIS:  Well, again, I think these were

          2    served in May before we had any of the fire reports, we

          3    had any of the investigation reports.  I mean as we sit

          4    here today we can withdraw those.  That's fine.

          5             MS. BURKE:  Well, and again, I mean you keep

          6    saying they were served in May, but you guys were

          7    fervently arguing that all of this discovery was warranted

          8    and, in fact, critical.  And, in fact, that you suffered

          9    prejudice because you haven't gotten it.  And that's the

         10    basis on which, you know, I'm reviewing all of this is

         11    based on what you're saying in your motion.  So...

         12             MS. ELLIS:  And I would say -- you know, I think

         13    that we have been severely prejudiced, particularly as it

         14    relates to all of the punitive damages discovery.  We have

         15    had to file a motion for summary judgment under the gun,

         16    as usual, for April -- I'm sorry -- August 16th.  We had

         17    no discovery from plaintiffs on that.

         18             So, you know, that's one example of extreme

         19    prejudice.  And I think that we could ask Mr. Gomes -- now

         20    that we definitely have a date -- and the reason I say we

         21    can withdraw it is because we can ask Mr. Gomes these

         22    question.  But, again, I think at the time when you're

         23    dealing with the lack of information, and no certainty

         24    with respect to depositions on calendar, we have -- and

         25    this is our last shot.  The trial is certainly going




                                                                       67



          1    November 11th -- or sorry -- November 4th, discovery is

          2    going to cut off a month prior to that.  So this is our

          3    last shot.  And because of the delay we have been unable

          4    to follow up on any of this discovery.  You know, things

          5    that we're going to have to take the responses as they

          6    are.

          7             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  In response to your last

          8    query --

          9             MR. MERRILL:  Excuse me.  I would like to echo

         10    that.

         11             Prejudice is exactly what we have with the sneaky

         12    withholding of information for the sanctions motion.

         13             Please, go ahead, Harry.

         14             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Sure, Charlie.

         15             The point about sprinkler questions.  We do quite

         16    a number of fire cases.  And sprinklers are a source of

         17    mitigation.  They have been since the MGM fire, since the

         18    Hilton fire, and the Dupont Plaza fire.  And if, for

         19    example, claims of you haven't fully compensated and paid

         20    us for all of our lost inventory, we are not still in the

         21    case, which we are today, then questions about were

         22    reasonable steps taken to mitigate loss that are required

         23    under this particular policy to have a fire suppression

         24    system in place, then now you might not think gee golly,

         25    they are not the most critical questions in the world, but




                                                                       68



          1    they are standard questions.  And the answer is no.  And

          2    he did substantially mitigate his loss in the second fire,

          3    the sprinkler system apparently stayed on all night long.

          4    And it water logged everything.  But it just water damage.

          5    It wasn't smoke damage.  That is one of those mitigating

          6    type actions.  So it's still on the case.  I'm assuming

          7    that's still why the questions are still on the case.

          8             Are they absolutely essential and critical, among

          9    others, I would say not.  But they should be relevant.

         10    And they should be relevant to the damages claims that are

         11    being made and to those questions that are being raised in

         12    regard to those claims.

         13             MR. MERRILL:  Harry, let me ask you this, didn't

         14    your underwriter write a letter and said, quote, "we

         15    shouldn't reinsure this guy again," which they didn't,

         16    "and we shouldn't have issued the policy because there are

         17    no fire sprinklers."

         18             Isn't that letter in your file by the

         19    underwriter?

         20             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Could have been.

         21             So that's the question, Charlie.

         22             MR. MERRILL:  I read --

         23             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  That -- that there were no

         24    sprinklers, Charlie?  My guy is going to testify that

         25    there are no sprinklers, and your guy doesn't have to.




                                                                       69



          1    That's how discovery works.

          2             MR. MERRILL:  No, Harry, it's in your file from

          3    your people.

          4             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  All right.

          5             MR. MERRILL:  The question has been answered on

          6    your end.

          7             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  It doesn't matter that the

          8    question has been answered on my end.  The question has

          9    not been answered by the plaintiff is the point.  That's

         10    what makes this relevant in a discovery standpoint.

         11             MR. MERRILL:  That's why you just said to my

         12    client how do you think the fire started.

         13             I think that's the genesis of the problem, your

         14    Honor.

         15             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  I'm sorry, I don't understand.

         16             MS. BURKE:  What's the genesis?

         17             MR. MERRILL:  Well, they have the information

         18    that they concluded.  Information that people agreed upon.

         19    The uncontested information that has been out there for

         20    almost three years.  And they ask -- say it's relevant how

         21    do you think the fire started.  And what's the status of

         22    your fire sprinklers.

         23             MS. BURKE:  I don't get it.

         24             MR. MERRILL:  Well, I don't think they should be

         25    asking those questions when they know the answer.

          1             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  I get it.

          2             Question, when you mentioned the case management

          3    conference or something in which you clarified on the

          4    record that Mr. Gomes was not a plaintiff, or you

          5    dismissed him, when was that?

          6             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  May 29th.

          7             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

          8             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  I think you have the full

          9    transcript of that somewhere.  It may have been the prior

         10    discovery hearing but there's a -- there's a full

         11    transcript.  And that was one of the first two pages.

         12    Charlie and I dealt with the housekeeping matter of

         13    whether or not Mr. Gomes, who is not a party to this

         14    policy, was a proper party to the lawsuit.

         15             MS. BURKE:  Got it.

         16             MR. MERRILL:  It was the name George Gomes not

         17    Greg.

         18             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Well, George.

         19             MR. MERRILL:  Or Gary.

         20             MS. BURKE:  But neither is a party?

         21             MR. MERRILL:  That's correct.

         22             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  George may not even exist.

         23             Okay.  Anything else?

         24             I guess let me -- let me -- Charlie, let me just

         25    ask you to kind of sum up anything else that you think




                                                                       71



          1    that I might need to know, and then I will pass it to

          2    Harry and Anne Marie, and then we are done.

          3             MR. MERRILL:  I'm satisfied with the record.

          4    Thank you.

          5             MS. BURKE:  All right.  Harry and Anne Marie?

          6             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Anne Marie, you had an issue

          7    about the meet and confer we did this morning, or was it

          8    yesterday?

          9             MS. ELLIS:  Yesterday.

         10             As it relates to this issue, I think it's been

         11    fully briefed.

         12             I just want to confirm that we can submit a short

         13    brief by Wednesday on the issues arising out of the

         14    discovery order two.

         15             MR. MERRILL:  Wednesday?

         16             MS. BURKE:  Yeah.

         17             To the extent that I have asked for further

         18    authority for some of these conclusions that you guys are

         19    putting forward.  Yeah.  Yeah.

         20             I mean I don't necessarily need a whole bunch of

         21    new arguments, but if you got authority on some of those

         22    propositions that I had asked for earlier, absolutely.

         23             MS. ELLIS:  Well, we do have another issue that's

         24    unrelated to these two motions if you are ready to discuss

         25    that.




                                                                       72



          1             MS. BURKE:  Sure.

          2             And so we can dismiss the court reporter for this

          3    since this isn't something that is even a new issue here

          4    currently.

          5             MS. ELLIS:  I think we should leave her on.  It's

          6    related to the coming trial.

          7             MR. MERRILL:  If that's the case, I want to have

          8    it on briefing schedule.  I don't want to just bring it up

          9    right now.

         10             MS. BURKE:  Well, we will bring it up right

         11    now --

         12             MR. MERRILL:  I don't want --

         13             MS. BURKE:  Because I want somebody to tell me

         14    what the issue is, and then we will see what we need to

         15    do, if anything.

         16             MS. ELLIS:  Sure.

         17             So I raised yesterday with Mr. Merrill and

         18    Mr. Reeves, we are prepared to produce the files on

         19    Monday.  As we discussed many times, there is third party

         20    personal identifying information in there.  So anything

         21    from driver's license, to phone numbers, to bank account

         22    information, to addresses.  And we're not talking about

         23    the insured, we're talking about third parties.

         24             MS. BURKE:  Sure.

         25             MS. ELLIS:  And so we have redacted that




                                                                       73



          1    information pursuant to Civil Code section 1798,

          2    California Rules of Court 1.210, and the U.S. Department

          3    of Labor that provides the list.  And I told the plaintiff

          4    that.  And I also asked that because in the event -- we're

          5    talking over five or six thousand pages -- in the event

          6    that there is an inadvertent disclosure of some PII, if we

          7    could agree to a protective order for these files.  And

          8    that's also contemplated in Colonial Life on page sixteen.

          9             And so, of course, I asked the question and was

         10    told no.  So I wanted to raise that today.

         11             MR. MERRILL:  I've never heard this before, nor

         12    did I get a redacted image.  I believe that the matter

         13    needs to be fully briefed.

         14             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Well, if it's --

         15             MS. BURKE:  You guys, let me just throw this out

         16    there, wouldn't this be something that would be the

         17    subject of some sort of a clawback provision if, in fact,

         18    some third party information or information that's totally

         19    not, you know, pertinent or appropriate and just

         20    inadvertently disclosed?

         21             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Here is the problem,

         22    Miss Burke, if I can amplify a little bit.

         23             MR. MERRILL:  It's just being raised at this

         24    time.

         25             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Charlie --




                                                                       74



          1             MR. MERRILL:  The order was redacted in October.

          2             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Charlie, Charlie, it has to do

          3    with the insured's employees.  It has to do with little

          4    children's school addresses.

          5             MR. MERRILL:  What's the name of that -- what's

          6    the name of that HIPAA related thing?  What's the acronym?

          7             MS. BURKE:  Okay --

          8             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  It's I-I-P-A-A.

          9             And here's the point, if, for example, in a

         10    business loss -- and we have several of these in the 55

         11    files that are going to be produced -- if in the course of

         12    a business loss, like this business loss, there is a

         13    listing of an insured's employees.  Not the insured who

         14    gave the consent, not the one who said oh, sure, turn over

         15    the whole file, they produce a list of all of their

         16    employees, with all of their Social Security numbers on

         17    them.  There's a California Rule of Court, it's rule

         18    1.102, there's several provisions of several codes.

         19    There's even a Federal Labor Standards Act that says we're

         20    not just supposed to cough up -- and this is truly third

         21    party, third party, third party.  That doesn't deal with

         22    business practices.  Doesn't even deal with the adjustment

         23    of loss claims.  It deals with personal information.

         24             And Miss Ellis sent you guys yesterday a very

         25    straightforward -- because they deal with it in their




                                                                       75



          1    products liability cases frequently -- I deal with it in

          2    employment and insurance cases too -- if this comes up,

          3    this just makes clear that the redactions are not to hide

          4    things from you, it's personal, clear and transparent that

          5    John Jones, who is not an insured but he is an employee of

          6    the ABC Insurance Company -- or ABC Veneers Company, who

          7    gave you a consent, gave you an approval for his fire loss

          8    case -- the employees' personal identifying information,

          9    their driver's license numbers, and complete auto policies

         10    aren't being disclosed.

         11             MS. BURKE:  And, Harry --

         12             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  If it's just redacted, it takes

         13    a lot of work.

         14             MS. BURKE:  And, Harry, let me -- let me just

         15    step in here.

         16             I totally understand what your concern is.  And I

         17    understand your concern is what if we don't redact this

         18    information.

         19             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Right.

         20             MS. BURKE:  Are you seeking to have -- what I

         21    don't understand is why this has to be complicated?

         22    Because if in fact --

         23             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  It doesn't.

         24             MS. BURKE:  If in fact you disclose somebody

         25    else's driver's license, isn't that exactly the kind of




                                                                       76



          1    thing that you would just have a clawback agreement for,

          2    for that specific piece of information?

          3             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We have specifically -- Anne

          4    Marie can explain what the process was with the insurance

          5    company because they have a protocol for this.  And they

          6    do not identify their insured versus somebody who is not

          7    an insured.  That's what this was about.

          8             And so Anne Marie can identify that.  I have

          9    given you examples of it.

         10             MS. BURKE:  I get the examples.  And I don't need

         11    anymore examples.

         12             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Yeah.

         13             MS. BURKE:  I understand how this can happen.

         14             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We have a --

         15             MS. BURKE:  I'm just trying to understand why

         16    this is -- what -- why a protective order and what is the

         17    scope of that protective order is the correct remedy here.

         18             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  I guess that's what --

         19             MR. MERRILL:  May I ask why we're hearing about

         20    this today?

         21             MS. BURKE:  Well, Charlie, I understand that we

         22    are briefing, and we are arguing totally different issues.

         23    I'm not -- no decision is arising out of this --

         24             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Right.  Exactly.

         25             MS. BURKE:  -- unless you guys can come to some




                                                                       77



          1    agreement as part of this discussion.

          2             I'm trying to understand what it is that they are

          3    proposing here, and see if there is a simpler alternative

          4    that is going to be satisfactory, so we can get these damn

          5    files that we have been waiting for, you know, months

          6    produced.

          7             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Let's make a proposal.

          8             The proposal is this, they have been redacted by

          9    the insurance company, that kind of information.  So, for

         10    example, if it says Joe Jones, his taxpayer ID number has

         11    a little black thing over it.

         12             MS. BURKE:  Right.

         13             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Okay.

         14             MS. BURKE:  Sure.

         15             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Somebody -- driver's license

         16    number on a fleet auto policy, their driver's license

         17    numbers are redacted.  Just like the rules require.

         18             Those files are going to be produced.  However,

         19    when we proposed this last night and said here is a

         20    proposed protective order and stipulation about clawback,

         21    and I think we were told produce all of the files un

         22    redacted.  The insured's have consented.  You guys are

         23    playing games.  Five thousand dollars a day in sanctions

         24    for every minute that you're late.  They are simply

         25    raising this now.  It doesn't involve the insureds.  It




                                                                       78



          1    doesn't involve their consent.  It involves people who are

          2    anybody else in this case is not -- there are thousands --

          3    thousands of records, maybe even a hundred thousand

          4    records that are going to be produced on Monday.  They are

          5    going to be produced with these redactions is our

          6    proposal.  If Charlie and Bill are arguing that they need

          7    to be produced without redactions, I will do whatever you

          8    say, or I will do whatever the court says, but I guess we

          9    will all have a giant clawback motion about why that

         10    shouldn't have happened that way because we are all

         11    lawyers, and we are all governed by these privacy statues.

         12    IIPAA or not, it's other people's private information,

         13    Charlie, not the insured, not subject to HIPAA, not

         14    subject to Colonial Life.

         15             We are trying --

         16             MS. BURKE:  So you guys --

         17             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  We are lawyers.

         18             MS. BURKE:  So you guys are prepared to produce

         19    the files redacted to remove third-party personal

         20    information, correct?

         21             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Correct.

         22             MS. BURKE:  Okay.

         23             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Correct.

         24             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  Well, I want those produced

         25    regardless.  And then, Charlie, is there -- I know you




                                                                       79



          1    haven't seen the files yet, I'm not asking you to

          2    commit -- but hypothetically if the only information that

          3    is apparently redacted from the files that are produced,

          4    things like third-party Social Security numbers and stuff

          5    like that, is that acceptable?

          6             MR. MERRILL:  Sure.

          7             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  So let's --

          8             MR. MERRILL:  Well, hold on.  Is it I-I-I-P-A or

          9    I-I-P-A?

         10             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  It is I-I-P-P-A.  It is the

         11    Insurance Information Privacy and Protection Act.

         12             MR. MERRILL:  Okay.  I-I-P-I-A?

         13             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  And it's I-I-P-P-A, Charlie.

         14    It's like HIPAA, except there's an H in HIPAA that --

         15             MS. BURKE:  I-I --

         16             MR. MERRILL:  Excuse me.  Harry, what's it like

         17    again?

         18             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Like HIPPA -- exactly the same

         19    as HIPPA.  Same -- same acronym except health is in place

         20    of insurance.

         21             MS. BURKE:  Instead of insurer.

         22             All right.  So I want to -- I want to put a pin

         23    in this whole redaction protective order redaction.  Let's

         24    get the documents produced and then if there is a problem

         25    we will deal with it.

          1             At this point I don't think we need to do

          2    anything further on this.  I just want to get this stuff

          3    produced.

          4             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Right.  That was our proposal.

          5    I will produce them -- we will produce them certainly, and

          6    in time, in good order.  They will see what the files are

          7    and how they were adjusted.  And, Charlie, if you guys

          8    have a problem with this, if you think that we are

          9    sandbagging or pulling wool over people's eyes or hiding

         10    the really good stuff regarding the third parties, you'll

         11    let us know for certain, right?

         12             MR. MERRILL:  I just want to be heard.

         13             MR. CHAMBERLAIN:  Nobody has got a shotgun to

         14    their head over things that I believe we are all required

         15    to do as lawyers concerning third parties having nothing

         16    to did with these cases, and nothing to do with these

         17    consents.

         18             MS. BURKE:  Okay.  So I think we are done,

         19    correct?

         20             MR. MERRILL:  I'm done.

         21             MS. BURKE:  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.

         22             And, Anne Marie, I know you are going to be

         23    sending me some additional stuff.  If you wouldn't mind

         24    sending me maybe a rough of the transcript as well, that

         25    would be appreciated.

          4             Thank you.

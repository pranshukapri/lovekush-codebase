           1   which I think we can all agree occurred

           2   on February 24th, 2017.

           3          A.    Yes.

           4          Q.    You've just taken an oath to

           5   tell the truth.  Have you ever taken an

           6   oath to tell the truth before?

           7          A.    Yes.

           8          Q.    In what kind of capacity?

           9          A.    I represented H&R Block in a

          10   lawsuit a client brought about hurting

          11   himself on a fence around one of our

          12   properties.

          13          Q.    And you were a witness in

          14   the litigation?

          15          A.    Yes, sir.

          16          Q.    Other than that, have you

          17   ever had to take one?

          18          A.    No.

          19          Q.    Okay.  I'm going ask you

          20   some questions, a little bit about the

          21   accident, your background, your injuries,

          22   your treatment, things of that nature.

          23   If at any time you don't hear me, you

          24   don't understand me, please stop me and

           1   tell me and I will repeat the question,

           2   talk softer, louder, slower, whatever it

           3   takes.  Okay?

           4          A.    Okay.

           5          Q.    Keep in mind the court

           6   reporter is taking down everything we

           7   say.  She can't take down nods of the

           8   head, shrugs of the shoulders, hand

           9   gestures and the like, so try to keep all

          10   of your responses verbal.  Okay?

          11          A.    Okay.

          12          Q.    Similarly, try to wait until

          13   I finish asking the question even though

          14   you might anticipate what I'm going to

          15   ask you, again so there's only one of us

          16   talking at a time and we're not talking

          17   over each other.  Okay?

          18          A.    Okay.

          19          Q.    If at any time you want to

          20   take a break, use the restroom, get

          21   something to drink, just speak up and

          22   we'll accommodate you.  Okay?

          23          A.    Okay.

          24          Q.    I do ask, however, that if

           1   you do want to take a break, that if

           2   there is a question pending, you answer

           3   the question and then we'll take a break.

           4   If you want to talk your attorney, if you

           5   want to come back, change the answer,

           6   whatever, we'll do it that way.

           7          A.    Okay.

           8          Q.    What is your address?

           1   indicates you have those conditions, you

           2   would disagree that you told them that?

           3          A.    I'm not understanding what

           4   you're asking me, sir.

           5          Q.    My question is if the

           6   medical records from the emergency room

           7   indicate that you have told them that you

           8   have a history of musculoskeletal

           9   disorder, chronic back pain, and

          10   osteoarthritis, would you disagree with

          11   that?

          12          A.    Yeah.  At the emergency

          13   room, once again, I mean, I was pretty

          14   discombobulated.  I couldn't quite

          15   remember stuff, and so I'm not quite sure

          16   what I would have told them.

          17          Q.    Okay.  In your answers to

          18   interrogatories, you indicate I saw

          19   somewhere -- here it is, worsening of the

          20   vertigo in terms of the injuries that you

          21   suffered in the accident.  Did you have

          22   vertigo before the accident?

          23          A.    Yes, sir.

          24          Q.    Okay.  What kind of history

           1   of vertigo do you have?

           2          A.    I mean, I'm not quite sure I

           3   understand.  So I have vertigo, so I went

           4   to see a therapist and she kind of did a

           5   treatment and that was pretty much it.

           6          Q.    Okay.  When did you see this

           7   provider?

           8          A.    I'm not sure.

           9          Q.    Was it within the last five

          10   years?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    Was it within the last two

          13   years?

          14          A.    Couldn't tell you.

          15          Q.    Okay.  Who was the

          16   therapist?

          17          A.    Couldn't tell you her name.

          18          Q.    How did you know to go to

          19   this therapist?

          20          A.    My next door neighbor went

          21   to her when they had vertigo, and she

          22   fixed him, so she recommended her, so I

          23   went to see her then.

          24          Q.    But you don't know when?

           1          A.    Couldn't remember.

           2          Q.    How many times did you see

           3   this person for your vertigo?

           4          A.    Maybe two or three.

           5          Q.    Two or three times somewhere

           6   between two and five years ago, is that

           7   what I'm hearing?

           8          A.    That's pretty fair, yes.

           9          Q.    What kind of treatment did

          10   you get on those two or three occasions?

          11          A.    They just tilt your head

          12   certain ways and it fixes it.

          13          Q.    Did you continue with having

          14   vertigo --

          15          A.    No.

          16          Q.    You didn't let me finish the

          17   question.  Did you continue with having

          18   the vertigo after you had these couple of

          19   treatments two to five years ago?

          20          A.    No.

          21          Q.    So you were vertigo free?

          22          A.    Yes, sir.

          23          Q.    So when you indicate that

          24   you had worsening of vertigo, what do you



                            Lexitas NG

                                                       25



           1   mean?

           2          A.    Once again, I'm not sure

           3   what you're referring to.

           4          Q.    I'm referring to your

           5   answers to interrogatories where in

           6   response to a question about your

           7   injuries, you answered back pain,

           8   worsening of the vertigo, headaches, and

           9   left leg injury.  So my question is when

          10   you say worsening of the vertigo, I

          11   interpret that, and please tell me if I'm

          12   wrong, that you had vertigo and it got

          13   worse?

          14          A.    No.  I had vertigo -- once,

          15   again, I'm not 100 percent sure of the

          16   timing of when I went to the doctor.

          17          Q.    Okay.

          18          A.    So I can't help you with all

          19   of that.  If the timing is during the

          20   accident time, then yeah.

          21          Q.    Do you mean it came back,

          22   the vertigo?

          23          A.    I went to the doctor for

          24   vertigo and she treated me I believe it



                            Lexitas NG

                                                       26



           1   was three times.  And then after that, it

           2   got dramatically better.  So I mean, I

           3   don't know the timing of all of that and

           4   where it affects as far as the accident

           5   is concerned.

           6          Q.    Did you suffer vertigo that

           7   you attribute to the accident?

           8          A.    I don't know what causes

           9   vertigo, so I can't tell you that.

          10          Q.    Okay.  This left leg injury,

          11   what is that?

          12          A.    Pain down my left leg and my

          13   knee.

          14          Q.    And how long have you had

          15   that?

          16          A.    Since the accident.

          17          Q.    Could you describe the pain

          18   for me, is it --

          19          A.    Like a throb, ache, needles.

          20          Q.    Has any medical provider

          21   told you what that involves and what it's

          22   from, anything like that?

          23          A.    (Witness nods.)

          24          Q.    No one has ever told you



                            Lexitas NG

                                                       27



           1   that?

           2          A.    When it comes to the medical

           3   stuff, I'm not trained or I don't have

           4   all the insight and stuff like that.  So

           5   when they start telling me the medical

           6   terms and stuff like that, I get lost

           7   very quickly.

           8          Q.    Okay.  I see you're wearing

           9   something around your torso.

          10          A.    Yes, sir.

          11          Q.    What is that?

          12          A.    That's a back brace.

          13          Q.    Where did you get the back

          14   brace?

          15          A.    From my back doctor.

          16          Q.    And who is that?

          17          A.    Dr. Efron.

          18          Q.    And when did he prescribe

          19   that?

          20          A.    When I first started seeing

          21   him.

          22          Q.    Approximately how long after

          23   the accident did you start seeing

          24   Dr. Efron?

           1          A.    I'm not 100 percent sure,

           2   probably within a month or two.

           3          Q.    And what did Dr. Efron do

           4   for you?

           5          A.    So we had x-rays and we had

           6   a couple different MRIs.  I've been

           7   seeing Dr. Efron for -- well, my last

           8   procedure with him for my back was last

           9   week.  I've had 14 different procedures.

          10          Q.    What kind of procedures?

          11          A.    So he does a couple

          12   different ones.  He injects -- oh, gosh.

          13   Steroids, I guess it's called, he injects

          14   steroids.

          15                MR. GITMAN:  I'm going to

          16          ask you not to guess.  So if

          17          you're not sure --

          18                THE WITNESS:  I'm not 100

          19          percent sure.

          20                MR. GITMAN:  What?

          21                MR. SABATO:  Nothing.

          22                MR. GITMAN:  You guys have

          23          the medical records.

          24                MR. SABATO:  That doesn't

           1          matter, I need to hear it from

           2          him.

           3                MR. GITMAN:  And if he

           4          doesn't know --

           5                MR. SABATO:  Well, when you

           6          tell him he doesn't know, then

           7          he's not going to move on.  But

           8          okay, we'll move on.

           9                MR. GITMAN:  You don't want

          10          him to guess what medicines he's

          11          taking, right?

          12                MR. SABATO:  I just wanted

          13          to ask what procedures he's had.

          14          He said he had 14 procedures.

          15   BY MR. SABATO:

          16          Q.    You obviously were able to

          17   count how many you had.  Why don't you

          18   describe what each of the procedures

          19   were?

          20          A.    So I go into the surgery

          21   center, they give me the thing that makes

          22   you sleepy or groggy, whatever.  And then

          23   he does something with injections in my

          24   back.

           1          Q.    Okay.

           2          A.    And then that's the process

           3   or the procedures.

           4          Q.    Those 14 procedures, were

           5   they all the same thing or did you have

           6   different kind of procedures?

           7          A.    Different kind.

           8          Q.    Other than the injections to

           9   the back after being sedated, what other

          10   kind of procedures did you have?

          11          A.    You're asking me to talk

          12   about the medical field.

          13          Q.    No, I'm asking you to

          14   describe what you did when you went.

          15          A.    It's the same type process.

          16   I don't know what he does when he goes in

          17   there.

          18          Q.    Okay.  Did it help?

          19          A.    Not -- well, the first -- up

          20   until the last one or two, no.  But the

          21   last two, it seemed to help a little bit.

          22   But over the course of time, the same

          23   problem comes back with my back.

          24          Q.    Okay.  The back brace that

           1   you wear, could you tell me how often you

           2   wear it?

           3          A.    It depends on my pain and

           4   what I'm doing, but I would say in an

           5   average week, probably five to six days.

           6          Q.    When you say days, do you

           7   wear it all day?

           8          A.    Yes, sir.

           9          Q.    So Dr. Efron, what is the

          10   practice he's affiliated with?

          11          A.    Main Line Spine.

          12          Q.    Now, the answers to

          13   interrogatories and documents that your

          14   attorney provided me indicates that you

          15   had ten epidural injection procedures at

          16   Main Line Spine, and you just indicated

          17   you had 12.  Could you tell me what the

          18   other two were?

          19          A.    Everything is with him.

          20          Q.    Because that was just last

          21   month.  Did you have anything in the last

          22   month?

          23          A.    Yes.

          24          Q.    Okay.  What did you have in

           1   the last month?

           2          A.    I had one a week ago.

           3          Q.    You have private health

           4   insurance?

           5          A.    Yes, sir.

           6          Q.    And that's with Blue Cross

           7   Blue Shield Personal Choice?

           8          A.    Let me just look to be sure.

           9                MR. GITMAN:  Do you want to

          10          take a copy of his insurance card?

          11                MR. SABATO:  I think you

          12          gave me that, I'm not sure.

          13                MR. GITMAN:  We normally do.

          14   BY MR. SABATO:

          15          Q.    I just want to confirm it so

          16   it's on the record.  Keep that out, let

          17   me write it down here.  Thank you, sir,

          18   there you go.  For the record, I'm

          19   handing back the personal choice card.

          20   Have you been placed on any kind of

          21   notice of a lien from Blue Cross Blue

          22   Shield?

          23          A.    No.

          24          Q.    When you would go to any of

           1   your medical providers, would you provide

           2   them with all of your insurance

           3   information?

           4          A.    Yes.

           5          Q.    Your car insurance and Blue

           6   Cross Blue Shield?

           7          A.    Just the insurance card that

           8   I gave them.

           9          Q.    Okay.  So are they aware

          10   that you have Blue Cross Blue Shield?

          11          A.    Yes, sir.

          12          Q.    They are aware?

          13          A.    Yes, sir.

          14          Q.    Okay.  To your knowledge, do

          15   you have any outstanding medical expenses

          16   that haven't been covered, either by your

          17   car insurance or Blue Cross Blue Shield?

          18          A.    Not to my knowledge.

          19          Q.    Now, so the accident

          20   happens, and we'll get into the accident

          21   a little bit later.  The accident

          22   happens, you're taken to Suburban

          23   Community Hospital; is that correct?

          24          A.    Yes, sir.

           1          Q.    And there, they ask you a

           2   lot of questions, ask you what happened,

           3   things like that?

           4          A.    I'm a little fuzzy while I

           5   was there.  Like I said, I hit my head

           6   and then I had back problems, so my

           7   memory and stuff like that is not as

           8   clear.

           9          Q.    You hit your head in this

          10   accident?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    What did you hit your head

          13   on?

          14          A.    Steering wheel, I take it.

          15          Q.    You had your seatbelt on or

          16   no?

          17          A.    Yes, sir.

          18          Q.    When you say you take it, do

          19   you know what you hit your head on?

          20          A.    I don't know for sure, no.

          21          Q.    So did you lose

          22   consciousness?

          23          A.    Not to my knowledge.

          24          Q.    Okay.  So after the

           1   emergency room, the next person you went

           2   to or the next treatment you got was at

           3   Aqua Sports Physical Therapy; is that

           4   correct?

           5          A.    No.

           6          Q.    That's not correct?

           7          A.    So I went to my family

           8   doctor, Dr. Lotito.

           9          Q.    Okay.  And Dr. Lotito did

          10   what?

          11          A.    She just did a basic

          12   physical, I guess it was, looked me over

          13   and all that, and then she recommended me

          14   to the physical therapist.

          15          Q.    Which is who?

          16          A.    Dr. Harry I believe his name

          17   is, in, oh God, Healing Hands in

          18   Conshohocken.

          19          Q.    And how long did you go to

          20   Healing Hands?

          21          A.    Best guess would be four to

          22   six months maybe, I'm not 100 percent

          23   sure, but I think that's probably pretty

          24   close.

           1          Q.    While you're going to

           2   Healing Hands, you're also going to Aqua

           3   Sports Physical Therapy?

           4          A.    So no.  I was going to

           5   Healing Hands, I went to once again, it's

           6   been a couple years, so the time overlaps

           7   I maybe be a little confused on, but I

           8   went to Dr. Efron, and he is the one that

           9   referred me to the Aqua Sports Therapy,

          10   because I could do therapy without weight

          11   on my body.

          12          Q.    According to the records

          13   that I saw, you went there from December

          14   27th of '17 to about March, I think March

          15   5th, of 2018.  Does that sound about

          16   right, about three months?

          17          A.    I would say probably, yes,

          18   pretty close.

          19          Q.    And you're also going to

          20   Healing Hands at that point -- no, that's

          21   incorrect, I take that back.  All right.

          22   And then you had some testing done, you

          23   had an MRI in June of 2017; is that

          24   correct?

           1          A.    I'm not sure of the dates.

           2          Q.    Okay.  Did anyone ever

           3   discuss with you the results of the MRI?

           4          A.    So the MRI was ordered by

           5   Dr. Efron.

           6          Q.    Okay.  Did he discuss the

           7   results of --

           8          A.    Yes, he showed me different

           9   things in the MRI.

          10          Q.    And what is your

          11   understanding of the results of the MRI?

          12          A.    So once again, when he

          13   starts talking from a medical

          14   perspective, I get lost so easily because

          15   he's speaking up here, and my level of

          16   medical understanding is down here.

          17          Q.    So you have no understanding

          18   of what the MRI did?

          19          A.    I don't know.  I can't...

          20          Q.    Okay.  Do you know if you

          21   had any injections before you had the

          22   MRIs?

          23          A.    I don't know that.

          24          Q.    Would you be able to say how

           1   long after the accident that you had an

           2   initial injection?

           3          A.    Wouldn't be able to tell you

           4   that, either.

           5          Q.    Was it more than a month,

           6   less than a month?

           7          A.    Wouldn't be able to tell

           8   you.

           9          Q.    So you have no judgment

          10   whatsoever as to when you had your first

          11   injection?

          12          A.    That's correct.

          23          A.    I can't recall.

          24          Q.    Are you receiving any kind

           1   of therapy now?

           2          A.    As I said, I just had an

           3   injection last week.

           4          Q.    No, I understand the

           5   injection.  But have you gone to Healing

           6   Hands, have you gone to Aqua Sports

           7   Therapy, have you gone to any physical

           8   therapy?

           9          A.    No, sir.

          10          Q.    And would the last time you

          11   had any kind of therapy -- did you have

          12   any therapy in 2019?

          13          A.    I guess I just want to be

          14   clear.

          15          Q.    I don't mean injections, I

          16   don't mean visits to a doctor.  I mean

          17   going to some kind of physical therapy,

          18   whether it be Healing Hands or --

          19          A.    I did not.

          20          Q.    Okay.  And in 2018?

          21          A.    Can't remember.

          22          Q.    Okay.  In 2019, so we're in

          23   July, we're half of 2019.  About how many

          24   injections do you think you've had in

           1   2019?

           2          A.    I would say -- see, I'm

           3   guessing again.

           4          Q.    Don't guess, but your best

           5   judgment.  I mean, was it one or was it

           6   five?  You know.

           7          A.    It's at least two.

           8          Q.    Okay, that's good.

          20          A.    I was coming from my home

          21   and I was going to work.

          22          Q.    Okay.  And when you say

          23   going to work, were you going to an

          24   office?

           1          A.    One of my offices.

           2          Q.    Which one?

           3          A.    Couldn't tell you, couldn't

           4   remember.  I have 34 of them, so I don't

           5   know exactly which one I was going to.

           6          Q.    Okay.  And this accident

           7   happened on what street?

           8          A.    It was on Germantown Pike.

           9          Q.    And about what time did the

          10   accident happen?

          11          A.    I was going to work, so it

          12   was probably morning.

          13          Q.    What were the traffic

          14   conditions like on Germantown Pike?

          15          A.    Are you talking about the

          16   weather or actual busy or not busy?

          17          Q.    I think I said traffic

          18   conditions, not the weather conditions,

          19   that's next.  If you want to tell me

          20   weather first, that's okay.

          21          A.    Normal, I guess.  I don't

          22   know how you define it.

          23          Q.    Was it heavy, was it light?

          24          A.    No, it was normal.

           1          Q.    Was it bumper to bumper?

           2          A.    No, no.

           3          Q.    Okay.  Because I don't know

           4   what normal is, because I don't travel

           5   that.  Steady?

           6          A.    I mean, steady is

           7   subjective.  So it wasn't bumper to

           8   bumper, it wasn't, I guess, free flowing

           9   maybe.

          10          Q.    Okay.  And how about the

          11   weather conditions?

          12          A.    Sunny, clear.

          13          Q.    Germantown Pike is laid out

          14   how, one lane, two lanes in each

          15   direction?

          16          A.    Two lanes each direction.

          17          Q.    And which lane were you in,

          18   the left or the right?

          19          A.    The left.

          20          Q.    Was there any shoulder

          21   there?

          22          A.    Pardon me.

          23          Q.    Was there any shoulder on

          24   Germantown Pike where the accident

           1   happened?

           2          A.    Yes, a small one right where

           3   we were at.

           4          Q.    Where did this accident

           5   happen on Germantown Pike, at an

           6   intersection?

           7          A.    Yeah.  It was at an

           8   intersection where the condominiums are,

           9   Plymouth Condos.  I'm going to have to

          10   stand up if that's okay.

          11          Q.    Go right ahead.  And how did

          12   the accident happen?

          13          A.    I was stopped at a light

          14   waiting for it to change, and I was

          15   struck in the rear.

          16          Q.    How would you categorize the

          17   impact on a scale of zero being virtually

          18   no impact, just a touching, to ten being

          19   the worst impact you could imagine?  On

          20   zero to ten, how would you describe it?

          21          A.    Once again, that's

          22   subjective.

          23          Q.    Well, I know, that's why I'm

          24   asking you.

           1          A.    So the fact that I wasn't

           2   expecting it and I was standing still and

           3   it did what it did to me, I would say a

           4   ten.

           5          Q.    Were you stopped behind a

           6   car or were you the first car at the

           7   light?

           8          A.    First car at the light.

           9          Q.    Was your car moved at all as

          10   a result of the impact?

          11          A.    Yes.

          12          Q.    About how far, half a car

          13   length, quarter car length --

          14          A.    Oh, gosh, more than that.

          15          Q.    -- two car lengths?

          16          A.    Probably three car lengths

          17   maybe.

          18          Q.    So you were pushed three car

          19   lengths?

          20          A.    Yes, sir.

          21          Q.    Did your car have any damage

          22   to it?

          23          A.    Yes, it was banged up in the

          24   back a little, but mostly just paint.

           9          Q.    Do you still have the car?

          10          A.    Yes, sir.

          11          Q.    Do you have it with you

          12   today?

          13          A.    Yes, sir.

          14          Q.    Is it out in the lot?

          16          Q.    Did you take any pictures of

          17   it?

          20   pictures of the damage to your car?

          21          A.    No, sir, no, sir.

          23   the scene?

           1          Q.    Okay.  Who drove it from the

           2   scene?

           3          A.    So a police officer backed

           4   it into a parking lot and a day or two

           5   later my son went down and got it.

           6          Q.    You had indicated previously

           7   that you worked from February until you

           8   were terminated in May because you

           9   couldn't do the job and given a package.

          10   When is the next time you went to do your

          11   job after the accident?

          12          A.    I couldn't, I stayed at

          13   home.

          14          Q.    Did you work at home?

          15          A.    I could do computer work.

          16   But once again, that's not what the job

          17   description is.

          18          Q.    Were you getting paid?

          19          A.    Yes, sir.

          20          Q.    So you were getting paid

          21   staying home doing computer work?

          22          A.    Yes, sir.

          23          Q.    Could you tell me where you

          24   would report to H&R Block, like did you

           1   have a place, like did you have a home

           2   office that you would report to?

           3          A.    I would go to any one of the

           4   34 offices.

           5          Q.    What would be their office

           6   location -- did you have a boss?

           7          A.    Yes, sir.

           8          Q.    And who was your boss?

           9          A.    Her name, Carole Banks I

          10   think her last name was.

          11          Q.    Where was she located, where

          12   was her office?

          13          A.    She's down in Washington, I

          14   think.

          15          Q.    DC?

          16          A.    Yes, sir.

          17          Q.    And if I'm not mistaken --

          18          A.    So with the work, I just

          19   want to make sure that we're clear.

          20          Q.    Okay.

          21          A.    So after the accident, I

          22   stayed home.  I tried to go to work, but

          23   I couldn't because of the pain medicine

          24   and stuff like that.  So I made an

           1   attempt to visit a couple offices, but

           2   the pain was just too great.  I had to

           3   take medicine that wouldn't allow me to

           4   drive, so it became very difficult for me

           5   to do that.  I just wanted you to

           6   understand in case I wasn't clear.

           7          Q.    Okay.  What kind of medicine

           8   were you given?

           9          A.    Pain medicine and muscle

          10   relaxers.

          11          Q.    And who gave them to you?

          12          A.    The doctor at the hospital.

          13          Q.    Okay.  So you got them at

          14   the emergency room?

          15          A.    Yes, sir.

          16          Q.    Did anyone, any of the other

          17   doctors you've seen, did they prescribe

          18   any pain medicine?

          19          A.    Yeah, my back doctor,

          20   Dr. Efron.

          21          Q.    What did he prescribe?

          22          A.    The same thing, Percocet and

          23   the nerves -- the muscle relaxers.

          24          Q.    Like Flexeril kind of stuff?

           1          A.    I don't know what it is to

           2   be exact.

           3          Q.    How long did you take

           4   Percocet?

           5          A.    I still take it now as

           6   needed.

           7          Q.    Okay.  Did you ever have to

           8   take any kind of painkillers for your

           9   back before this accident?

          10          A.    No, sir.

          11          Q.    Does your car have any

          12   visible damage to it other than the paint

          13   scratches?

          14          A.    Just the paint scratches.

          15          Q.    Dents or anything?

          16          A.    No, sir.

           1   disciplinary action taken against you at

           2   H&R Block in the year prior to the

           3   accident?

           4          A.    No.

           5          Q.    And could you tell me when

           6   you first learned of a package that you

           7   were going to get to leave H&R Block?

           8          A.    The day I was terminated.

           9          Q.    And how were you notified,

          10   phone call, letter?

          11          A.    "Ken, can you come in and

          12   meet with us?"

          13          Q.    Where did you meet?

          14          A.    At a hotel.

          15          Q.    And tell me how that went.

          16          A.    I was terminated, so they

          17   handed me a letter that said, you know,

          18   "Due to performance issues, we're going

          19   to terminate you and move forward."

          20          Q.    Did they specify those

          21   performance issues?

          22          A.    No.

          23          Q.    Do you still have the

           1          A.    No.

           2          Q.    What was your understanding

           3   of the performance issues?

           4          A.    Just that I couldn't get to

           5   the offices.  My work history at H&R

           6   Block was impeccable.

           7          Q.    Do you know of anyone else

           8   who got any kind of separation around the

           9   same time?

          10          A.    No.

          11          Q.    Did you have any plans to

          12   retire?

          13          A.    No.

          14          Q.    Have you ever applied for

          15   Social Security disability?

          16          A.    Yes.

          17          Q.    When?

          18          A.    Shortly thereafter.

          19          Q.    Thereafter being?

          20          A.    The accident, yes, sir.

          21          Q.    Not the termination, the

          22   accident?

          23          A.    No, the termination.

          24          Q.    So shortly after the

           1   termination?

           2          A.    Correct.

           3          Q.    That was in May?

           4          A.    The termination was in May.

           5   I'm not exactly sure when, but

           6   probably -- once again, I don't want to

           7   guess, but shortly after the termination.

           8          Q.    Is that still pending?

           9          A.    No.

          10          Q.    What happened?

          11          A.    It was denied.

          12          Q.    And who is it that supported

          13   your application for Social Security

          14   disability, what doctor?

          15          A.    I'm not sure I understand

          16   the question.

          17          Q.    Well, when you apply for

          18   Social Security disability, you have to

          19   have medical support, correct?

          20          A.    So it was Dr. Efron.

          21          Q.    How about Dr. Lotito?

          22          A.    She wasn't involved in that.

          23          Q.    Also, you said you did go to

           8          weren't in the package.

           9                MR. GITMAN:  No medical

          10          records were in the package, or

          11          just Dr. Lotito's?

          12                MR. SABATO:  No, no, I got

          13          tons of records.  Just Dr. Lotito

          14          I'm just asking if you have any.

          15                MR. GITMAN:  I don't have

          16          anything on me, but I'm certain

          17          that we have it back at the office

          18          so I'll make a note to make sure

          19          that we supplement that.

          20                MR. SABATO:  Okay.

          21   BY MR. SABATO:

          22          Q.    Were you denied Social

          23   Security disability?

          24          A.    Yes.

           1          Q.    Have you appealed that?

           2          A.    So my understand of the

           3   process is you apply for it and then they

           4   either approve it or deny it.  So mine

           5   was denied, so then I went to a video

           6   conference hearing, and that was denied.

           7          Q.    Okay.  And when was that

           8   approximately, was it this year, last

           9   year?

          10          A.    I couldn't take a guess.  I

          11   would say probably -- I don't want to

          12   give you probably's, I don't want to be

          13   wrong.

          14          Q.    Did you reapply?

          15          A.    So I did not, no.

          16          Q.    I don't remember if I asked

          17   you this, I don't think I did.  What's

          18   your date of birth?

          19          A.    1/3/54.

          20          Q.    And that makes you 64?

          21          A.    65.

          22          Q.    So you are now Medicare

          23   eligible?

          24          A.    Yes, sir.

           1          Q.    Do you have any plans to

           2   reapply?

           3          A.    No, sir.

           4          Q.    We'll eventually be able to

           5   find this out, but let me just ask you so

           6   we can try to move this whole matter

           7   along.  The reasons for your application

           8   for Social Security disability are what,

           9   what conditions, just your back?

          10          A.    Yes, my back, yes, sir.

          11          Q.    Anxiety?

          12          A.    No.

          13          Q.    Chronic back pain?

          14          A.    Chronic back pain, yes.

          15          Q.    Osteoarthritis?

          16          A.    I don't know what that is, I

          17   don't want to even guess.

          18          Q.    Have you ever heard that

          19   term?

          20          A.    Osteo...

          21          Q.    Osteoarthritis.

          22          A.    Not to my knowledge.

          23          Q.    And you would have no

          24   understanding or reason why a doctor at

           1   the emergency room would write that you

           2   told them that?

           3          A.    I've already answered that

           4   question.

           5          Q.    No, right, your answer is

           6   no?

           7          A.    Yeah, right.  I mean...

           8          Q.    So basically it's just your

           9   low back?

          10          A.    The lower back, yes.

          11          Q.    As far as your reasoning for

          12   applying for disability?

          13          A.    Yes, sir.

          14          Q.    Okay.  Tell me, if you can,

          15   some of the limitations or ramifications

          16   of your injuries that you attribute to

          17   this accident?

          18          A.    Basically, it changed my

          19   life.  I guess from a financial

          20   standpoint, obviously I lost my job.  The

          21   job was six figures plus was the salary,

          22   so...

          23          Q.    What was your salary?

          24          A.    There was a base salary and



                            Lexitas NG

                                                       57



           1   then there was a bonus.  So the base

           2   salary was, I don't know, 96, $98,000,

           3   and then bonuses up to 30 or $40,000

           4   depending on how well you did.  So the

           5   loss of that.

           6                And then before the

           7   accident, I was very, very active,

           8   especially with my children.  I golfed

           9   with them every weekend, we bowled, we

          10   played softball, we were in a softball

          11   league.  You know, I could -- anything

          12   around the house, I could mow the grass,

          13   home repairs, all that stuff.  I could

          14   travel, I could do virtually anything I

          15   wanted.  So that was all before the

          16   accident.  And now I'm virtually almost

          17   confined to the house in a sitting

          18   position.

          19                The pain medicine, I can't

          20   do hardly anything while I'm taking the

          21   pain medicine.  My movement with my back

          22   is limited.  I have difficulty sleeping.

          23   When I go to sleep, it takes me anywhere

          24   from two to three hours before my back

           1   gets in a position where I'm comfortable

           2   enough to sleep.

           3                Even little things like, I

           4   hate to say this, excuse me, but wiping

           5   my butt after I go to the bathroom, it is

           6   painful because of the position I have to

           7   turn to to try to do it.  I can't

           8   participate in sports.  My one son lives

           9   in Boston, I can't go up and visit him

          10   because I can't travel.

          11                Any vacation plans, I did

          12   want to go to Africa and that's always

          13   been on my bucket list and stuff like

          14   that, but I can't do that.  So it's

          15   just -- it's a disaster.

          16          Q.    And this was a like a light

          17   switch, you had absolutely no prior back

          18   problems before the accident?

          19          A.    Like I said, I was in a

          20   bowling league, I golfed with my sons, we

          21   played softball every year, we were in a

          22   neighborhood softball league.  We did all

          23   that.  Healthy doing all the things

          24   around the house, could work, all of

           1   that.  And then after the accident, it

           2   was all just -- it was all gone.

           3                MR. SABATO:  Off the record.

           9   BY MR. SABATO:

          10          Q.    Before this accident, have

          11   you ever been involved in a car accident

          12   where you injured yourself?

          13          A.    So I was in a car accident,

          14   but I don't recall if -- I mean, this is

          15   when I was a teenager, so it's 50 years

          16   ago.  But I don't recall being physically

          17   injured.

          18          Q.    Were you involved in an

          19   accident in March of 2018 where you were

          20   struck by a car that fled the scene?

          21          A.    So in 2018, the car was hit

          22   in a Walmart parking lot if that's what

          23   you're referring to.

          24          Q.    Was it around March 11th,

           1   2018?

           2          A.    Yeah, probably.

           3          Q.    So your car was parked?

           4          A.    Parked in Walmart, yes, sir.

           5          Q.    Nobody was it in it?

           6          A.    No, sir.

           7          Q.    In August of 2014 was your

           8   car run off the road?

           9          A.    Not to my knowledge.

          10          Q.    Were you involved in

          11   anything on March 30th, 2015?

          12          A.    Not to my knowledge.

          13          Q.    Now you said 50 years ago.

          14   Do you recall being in an accident in

          15   2003?  Little bit less than 50 years.

          16          A.    I don't even remember.

          17          Q.    So other than this accident

          18   50 years ago that you do remember, what

          19   did you injure in that accident?

          20          A.    I don't remember.  I barely

          21   remember the accident, I remember just

          22   being in a car accident with my new car.

          23          Q.    Okay.  Have ever been

          24   involved in a slip and fall or anything

           1   like that --

           2          A.    No, sir.

           3          Q.    -- before this accident?

           4          A.    No, sir.

           5          Q.    Did you have ever have any

           6   sports injuries, hurt yourself bowling?

           7          A.    Once in a while you pull a

           8   muscle or something like that, but that's

           9   about it.  I think every athlete does

          10   that.

          11          Q.    And you've never made any

          12   complaints about your low back prior to

          13   this accident?

          14          A.    Correct.

          15          Q.    How is your vertigo now, is

          16   that better?

          17          A.    Yes, excellent.

          18          Q.    And I guess you already

          19   answered this.  Since this accident, you

          20   have not been involved in anything,

          21   right?

          22          A.    Correct.

          23          Q.    Have you ever been in any

          24   kind of drug or alcohol rehabilitation?

           1          A.    No, sir.  Proud to say I've

           2   never had a drop of alcohol in my whole

           3   life, couldn't even tell you what it

           4   tastes like.

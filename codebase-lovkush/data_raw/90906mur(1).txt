  2                      Mary Murphy,                   
  3   having been sworn by the notary, testified as     
  4   follows:                                          
  5        EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT     
  6   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  7        Q     Good morning, Ms. Murphy.  My name is  
  8   Jennifer Alexander.  We briefly met off the       
  9   record.  If you could please state your full      
 10   name, including your middle name, and spell it    
 11   for the record, please.                           
 12        A     Mary Elaine Murphy.  M-A-R-Y;          
 13   E-L-A-I-N-E; M-U-R-P-H-Y.                         
 14        Q     What is your address, please?          
 15        A     6595 Deep Run Parkway, Elkridge,       
 16   Maryland 21075.                                   
 17        Q     Have you ever had your deposition      
 18   taken before?                                     
 19        A     Yes.                                   
 20        Q     When was the last time?                
 21        A     I don't recall the date.               
 22        Q     Okay.  Approximately?                  
00005
  1        A     Oh, my gosh.                           
  2        Q     Was it 10 years ago, 20 years ago?     
  3        A     Yes.                                   
  4        Q     So it's been a while?                  
  5        A     It's been a while.                     
  6        Q     Let me just go over some brief rules   
  7   of the deposition for you so we both are on the   
  8   same page with how this works.                    
  9              It's very informal, as you can see.    
 10   But it is important that you speak verbally all   
 11   of your responses because the court reporter is   
 12   taking down everything everyone is saying, and    
 13   she cannot accurately record head shakes, head    
 14   nods, uh-huhs, uh-uhs, things like that.  They    
 15   become very difficult to decipher months down the 
 16   road on a black-and-white transcript.  So please  
 17   make sure that you answer yes, no, or I don't     
 18   know, or make sure all of your answers are        
 19   through verbal words.                             
 20              Make sure that we don't speak over one 
 21   another.  It's sort of like a shortwave radio     
 22   where I ask my question, I stop, and then you     
00006
  1   give your answer.  Then I wait until you're       
  2   finished until I ask my next question.  Talking   
  3   over one another muddles up the record and is     
  4   also very accurate -- very difficult to           
  5   accurately record if we're both speaking at the   
  6   same time.                                        
  7              Your lawyer may make certain           
  8   objections today.  He's doing that because he's   
  9   doing his job for you.  Unless he tells you not   
 10   to answer, which I don't anticipate, you can go   
 11   ahead and answer the question.  But this isn't    
 12   meant to be a memory test necessary -- well, I    
 13   guess it is a little bit of a memory test, but    
 14   it's not meant to be so oppressive on you because 
 15   we're going to be talking about a lot of dates    
 16   and a lot of prior history.  So give me your best 
 17   answer.                                           
 18              If you don't feel like you know the    
 19   answer, you can simply just tell me you don't     
 20   know the answer, and that's fine, and we'll move  
 21   on hopefully.  If you need a break, let me know.  
 22   If you need to use a restroom, if I can refill    
00007
  1   your water, let me know.  We can certainly do     
  2   that.  It's not an endurance test either.         
  3              Do you understand all those -- all of  
  4   those instructions?                               
  5        A     Yes.                                   
  6        Q     One final one is if you need me to     
  7   rephrase my question because you don't understand 
  8   my question or I haven't asked it in a way that's 
  9   understandable, please just tell me that you      
 10   don't understand my question before you give me   
 11   your answer, and I'll be happy to rephrase my     
 12   question.  If you answer my question as I word    
 13   it, I'm going to assume you understand the        
 14   question, and you're giving me the answer to that 
 15   question.  Fair enough?                           
 16        A     Yes.                                   
 17               (Deposition Exhibit Number 1 was      
 18   marked for identification and retained by         
 19   counsel.)                                         
 20   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 21        Q     I'm going to show us what's been       
 22   marked as Deposition Exhibit 1, which is just     
00008
  1   sort of your invitation to be here today that     
  2   asked you to bring certain documents if you had   
  3   any with you.  Many, if not all, of these         
  4   documents you may have given to your lawyer and   
  5   he's given to me already.  So you don't need to   
  6   duplicate those efforts.                          
  7              Were there any other additional        
  8   records that you brought with you today?          
  9        A     No.                                    
 10        Q     Did you review --                      
 11              MR. SANDUL:  Hold on a second.  She    
 12   did -- she did bring a note that the other lady   
 13   who was the witness wrote.  So she has that.      
 14              MS. ALEXANDER:  Is it the same one we  
 15   produced to you in discovery, or are you saying   
 16   something different?                              
 17              MR. SANDUL:  It's a little handwritten 
 18   note.                                             
 19              MS. ALEXANDER:  On a statement form?   
 20              MR. SANDUL:  No.  It wasn't a          
 21   statement form.                                   
 22              MS. ALEXANDER:  Let me see it.         
00009
  1              MR. SANDUL:  I wanted her to bring it  
  2   just in case.  That's it.  You're certain free to 
  3   make a copy.  We have not been able to get in     
  4   touch with her yet.                               
  5              MS. ALEXANDER:  With Ms. Walter?       
  6              MR. SANDUL:  No.                       
  7              MS. ALEXANDER:  You called her at this 
  8   number and just hasn't connected her?             
  9              MR. SANDUL:  Called it, everything.    
 10   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 11        Q     Your lawyer has just handed me a half  
 12   a ripped piece of index paper that has some       
 13   handwritten -- a name and phone number on there   
 14   of Nicole Walter, a number of (443) 591-0374 with 
 15   Wal-Mart June 8th and then some other handwritten 
 16   notes on there.  Is this your handwriting or      
 17   someone else's?                                   
 18        A     The top and the bottom are mine.       
 19        Q     So where it says "Wal-Mart June 8th"   
 20   is yours?                                         
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     But Nicole Walter with the phone       
00010
  1   number is not yours?                              
  2        A     Yes.                                   
  3        Q     Who is Jackie or Jacqueline, if you    
  4   know?                                             
  5        A     The lady at Wal-Mart.                  
  6        Q     That you spoke with?                   
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     Do you know her last name?             
  9        A     No.                                    
 10        Q     And on the back, is that your          
 11   handwriting?                                      
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And what is that relating to, if       
 14   anything?                                         
 15        A     Life insurance.                        
 16        Q     So not related to this case?           
 17        A     No.                                    
 18        Q     So what's written on the back "AIG     
 19   Direct" is not related to this case?              
 20        A     No.                                    
 21        Q     Fair enough.                           
 22              MR. SANDUL:  You don't need to mark    
00011
  1   it.  Just make a copy.                            
  2   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  3        Q     Any other documents on Deposition      
  4   Exhibit 1 that you have in your possession like   
  5   journals, diaries, calendars, e-mails,            
  6   handwritten notes, films from radiographic        
  7   studies that you may have been given from your    
  8   doctor's office, anything like that?              
  9        A     No.                                    
 10        Q     And you've had a chance to review this 
 11   document schedule, and to the best of your        
 12   ability you don't have any of these documents to  
 13   produce unless they've already been produced?     
 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15               (Deposition Exhibit Number 2 was

 10              I'm going to ask you to turn to the

 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15        Q     Do you have any changes, edits,        
 16   modifications to Deposition Exhibit 2, or is all  
 17   of that still accurate to the best of your        
 18   ability to remember?                              
 19              MR. SANDUL:  Just the change on the    
 20   shopping cart.                                    
 21              THE WITNESS:  Yes.

  1        Q     What is your change?                   
  2        A     I didn't have a shopping cart.         
  3        Q     You're referring to answer to          
  4   Interrogatory Number 2 where you wrote,           
  5   "Plaintiff was pushing a cart in the defendant    
  6   store when she slipped on a wet spot on the       
  7   floor"?                                           
  8        A     Yes.                                   
  9        Q     So why are you making that change now? 
 10        A     I didn't have a cart.  I watched the   
 11   video.                                            
 12        Q     Okay.  And I don't ever want to know   
 13   what you and your attorney or your legal team     
 14   discussed because that's all privileged and       
 15   confidential.  So none of these questions are     
 16   meant to invade that privilege.                   
 17              (Discussion off the record.)           
 18   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 19        Q     Are you saying that you answered these 
 20   Interrogatories before you watched the video?     
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     And then you watched the video and     
00014
  1   realized that you did not have a shopping cart?   
  2        A     Right.                                 
  3        Q     But in your memory before you watched  
  4   the video, you had a shopping cart?               
  5        A     Yes.                                   
  6        Q     Anything else you would need to change 
  7   or edit in Deposition Exhibit 2?                  
  8        A     Can I speak with him?                  
  9        Q     Actually, you cannot, not during --    
 10   since you're under oath now and we started the    
 11   deposition.                                       
 12              MR. SANDUL:  Mary, let me say this.    
 13   These are the same ones that you signed           
 14   originally, and those are the ones we did         
 15   yesterday.                                        
 16              THE WITNESS:  Okay.                    
 17              MR. SANDUL:  So if that helps you.     
 18   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 19        Q     And none of these questions are meant  
 20   to be trick questions.  I haven't handed you      
 21   something that's been changed.  It's just         
 22   standard questions.  So your answer to -- is      
00015
  1   there anything additional you need to change      
  2   other than what you just changed on answer to     
  3   Interrogatory Number 2?                           
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     There is something additional you need 
  6   to change?                                        
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     What is that?                          
  9        A     On Question 23, it says here she does  
 10   not recall if used any medical marijuana before   
 11   the incident.  And I did not.                     
 12        Q     Talk to me.                            
 13        A     I'm sorry.                             
 14        Q     That's okay.  So your answer to        
 15   Interrogatory Number 23 as it's in Exhibit 2      
 16   states, second sentence, "The plaintiff also      
 17   takes prescribed medical marijuana as needed for  
 18   neck and low back pain.  She uses the vape oil    
 19   and is allotted 36 grams per month.  She does not 
 20   recall if she used the medical marijuana before   
 21   the incident."                                    
 22              What about that would you like to      
00016
  1   change?                                           
  2        A     The very last sentence.                
  3        Q     And what would you like to change      
  4   about that?                                       
  5        A     That I did not use anything that       
  6   morning.                                          
  7        Q     Use any medical marijuana?             
  8        A     Correct.                               
  9        Q     Okay.  The question asks if you used   
 10   it within 48 hours of the date of the incident.   
 11   So did you use medical marijuana within 48 hours  
 12   of the incident?                                  
 13        A     Yes.                                   
 14        Q     And did you use it within 24 hours of  
 15   the incident?                                     
 16        A     Yes.                                   
 17        Q     Did you use it within 12 hours of the  
 18   incident?                                         
 19        A     No.                                    
 20        Q     So when is your memory that you last   
 21   smoked marijuana prior to the incident, which I   
 22   believe the video reflects was about 12:45 p.m.   
00017
  1              MR. SANDUL:  12:46 I think.            
  2              THE WITNESS:  The evening before.      
  3   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  4        Q     What time the evening before?          
  5        A     Eight o'clock.                         
  6        Q     Eight p.m.?                            
  7        A     Yes, sir.                              
  8        Q     And then the vape oil, is that a       
  9   separate marijuana way to ingest marijuana for    
 10   you?                                              
 11        A     Yes.                                   
 12        Q     Did you use marijuana vape oil -- did  
 13   you vape marijuana oil or cannabis oil the 48     
 14   hours prior to the incident?                      
 15        A     Yes.                                   
 16        Q     Did you vape -- do you call it         
 17   cannabis oil or marijuana oil?                    
 18        A     Cannabis oil.                          
 19        Q     Did you vape cannabis oil 24 hours     
 20   prior to the incident?                            
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     Did you vape cannabis oil 12 hours     
00018
  1   prior to the incident?                            
  2        A     No.                                    
  3        Q     When was the last time you vaped       
  4   cannabis oil prior to the incident?               
  5        A     Eight p.m. the night before.           
  6        Q     So you smoked marijuana at 8 p.m. the  
  7   night before and vaped cannabis oil at 8 p.m. the 
  8   night before?                                     
  9        A     No, ma'am.                             
 10        Q     Are they separate or different --      
 11        A     They're different.                     
 12        Q     Okay.  Didn't you tell me you last     
 13   smoked marijuana at 8 p.m. the night before?      
 14        A     No.  The oil.                          
 15        Q     Okay.  When did you last smoke         
 16   marijuana before the incident?                    
 17        A     It's been months.                      
 18        Q     Okay.  Maybe I'm confused.  I thought  
 19   you said when I asked you did you smoke marijuana 
 20   48 hours prior to the incident, you said yes.     
 21        A     I was confused because I -- I still    
 22   call it marijuana.                                
00019
  1        Q     You still call what marijuana?         
  2        A     The vape.  It's an oil.                
  3        Q     Yes.                                   
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     Okay.  So are you saying when you told 
  6   me you smoked marijuana 48 hours before, you were 
  7   talking about cannabis oil?                       
  8        A     Correct.                               
  9        Q     Okay.  So let me separate those things 
 10   for you so we're both on the same page.  When I   
 11   say smoke marijuana, I mean actually bud          
 12   marijuana.                                        
 13              So when is the last time you smoked    
 14   marijuana prior to the incident?                  
 15        A     It's been at least two months.         
 16        Q     So the incident was in June.  The last 
 17   time you smoked actual leaf marijuana, bud        
 18   marijuana, was sometime in April of 2018?         
 19        A     Yes.                                   
 20        Q     The cannabis oil you vaped the night   
 21   before the incident at 8 p.m.?                    
 22        A     Correct.                               
00020
  1        Q     How much?                              
  2        A     Probably about three or four hits      
  3   because it's oil.                                 
  4        Q     And is it your testimony that you have 
  5   a prescription for cannabis oil?                  
  6        A     Yes, ma'am.                            
  7        Q     When did you get that prescription?    
  8        A     April 2017.                            
  9        Q     And what doctor gave you that          
 10   prescription?                                     
 11        A     Dr. Waun.                              
 12        Q     How do you spell that last name?       
 13        A     W-H-A-N.                               
 14        Q     And where does Dr. Wah --              
 15        A     I'm sorry.  W-A-U-N [sic].             
 16        Q     Where does Dr. Wah practice?           
 17        A     Poole Road in Westminster, Maryland.   
 18        Q     What is Dr. Wah's area of practice, if 
 19   you know?                                         
 20        A     Medical marijuana physician.           
 21        Q     So he's specifically --                
 22        A     Cannabis.

  2   medical marijuana?                                
  3        A     Correct.                               
  4        Q     Do you know what type of specialty he  
  5   is?  Is he a primary care physician, for example, 
  6   or is he an orthopedist, or do you know?          
  7        A     I don't know.                          
  8        Q     Do you know his first name?            
  9        A     No.                                    
 10        Q     How many times have you seen Dr. Wah?  
 11        A     Twice.                                 
 12        Q     In your life?                          
 13        A     Yes.

 16        A     Correct.                               
 17        Q     You didn't lose consciousness?         
 18        A     No, ma'am.                             
 19        Q     No part of your body struck the floor, 
 20   correct?                                          
 21        A     Correct.                               
 22        Q     Are you saying that part of your body  
00059
  1   struck something else?                            
  2        A     My elbow caught the Pepsi display.     
  3        Q     Which elbow?                           
  4        A     My right one.                          
  5        Q     And when you say it caught the Pepsi   
  6   display, what do you mean?                        
  7        A     When I -- when my foot hit the wet     
  8   spot on the floor, it slid out in front of me.  I 
  9   twisted back.  And when I went to come down, I    
 10   went -- the Pepsi display here, I caught with     
 11   this arm and got back up.                         
 12        Q     When you say "got back up," what do    
 13   you mean?                                         
 14        A     Because I was like down, twisted down. 
 15   So I had to pull myself back up.                  
 16        Q     So for the record, what you're         
 17   demonstrating to me, which we don't have on       
 18   video, is that you were leaned over to your right 
 19   with your right arm extended causing your elbow   
 20   to make contact with the Pepsi display and your   
 21   body was leaned over to the right to some degree. 
 22   Is that fair what you're showing me and I'm now   
00060
  1   trying to emulate?                                
  2        A     As the slip was happening, yes.        
  3        Q     Okay.  So how far was your body leaned 
  4   to the right?                                     
  5        A     I don't recall.                        
  6        Q     And did your body right itself?  You   
  7   just rebalanced yourself?                         
  8        A     I did.                                 
  9        Q     When you were walking into the         
 10   entrance aisle we'll call it, as you called it,   
 11   was it well lit?                                  
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     Was there anything obstructing your    
 14   way?                                              
 15        A     No.                                    
 16        Q     Did it seem like a busy time at the    
 17   Wal-Mart or average time --                       
 18        A     No.                                    
 19        Q     -- or slow time?                       
 20        A     It was slow.                           
 21        Q     How would you describe it?  Prior to   
 22   your slip, did you see any Wal-Mart associates or 
00061
  1   managers prior to -- in those seconds from        
  2   walking in until you slipped?                     
  3        A     No, ma'am.                             
  4        Q     Did you see what it was that you       
  5   slipped on?                                       
  6        A     No.                                    
  7        Q     Where were you looking when you were   
  8   walking down the entrance aisle?                  
  9        A     Straight ahead.                        
 10        Q     You described what you slipped on as   
 11   something wet.  Why do you say that?              
 12        A     Because when I got up, I looked to see 
 13   what had happened, what I had slipped on, and it  
 14   was liquid on the floor.                          
 15        Q     Okay.  Describe what you saw.  You     
 16   said got up, and as a lawyer, that makes me a     
 17   little crazy.                                     
 18              MR. SANDUL:  We'll stipulate she was   
 19   not on the ground.  When she means get up, she    
 20   just righted herself from leaning over.           
 21              MS. ALEXANDER:  Okay.  Fair enough.    
 22              MR. SANDUL:  No dispute.               
00062
  1   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  2        Q     So what did you see when you righted   
  3   yourself?                                         
  4        A     Liquid on the floor that when my foot  
  5   went through it, I kind of like spread it out.    
  6        Q     Smeared it when your foot went through 
  7   it?                                               
  8        A     Yes.                                   
  9        Q     Okay.  What color was the liquid?      
 10        A     Clear.                                 
 11        Q     What was its texture or consistency?   
 12        A     I don't -- I don't understand.         
 13        Q     Like toothpaste is thick, but coffee   
 14   is thin.                                          
 15        A     It was thin.                           
 16        Q     Was it -- can you describe it any      
 17   other way --                                      
 18        A     Clear.                                 
 19        Q     -- than clear and thin?  Was it        
 20   sticky?                                           
 21        A     No.                                    
 22        Q     Did it have an odor?                   
00063
  1        A     I didn't smell it.  I don't know.      
  2        Q     Did it have bubbles or any other       
  3   texture to it?                                    
  4        A     No, ma'am.                             
  5        Q     Could you see from where it was        
  6   coming?                                           
  7        A     No, ma'am.                             
  8        Q     What was its size, or was it droplets? 
  9   How would you describe it in its size?            
 10        A     About a 12-inch radius, I guess.       
 11        Q     So a 12-inch radius is like a dinner   
 12   plate.  Would you say it was as big as a dinner   
 13   plate?                                            
 14        A     No.                                    
 15        Q     Okay.  Is it bigger or smaller?        
 16        A     Smaller.                               
 17        Q     So if there's something in everyday    
 18   life you can equate it to, like these coasters,   
 19   or is there something in your life that you can   
 20   equate it to, the circumference of a glass or     
 21   something in everyday normal life.                
 22        A     Well, it smeared.  So I'm not quite    
00064
  1   sure exactly the size of it before I smeared it.  
  2        Q     Okay.  So when you smeared it, it made 
  3   it bigger?                                        
  4        A     Correct.                               
  5        Q     So when you looked at it, it was       
  6   smeared already?                                  
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     What was the size when it was smeared? 
  9        A     About 12.                              
 10        Q     About the size of a dinner plate?      
 11        A     Mm-hmm.                                
 12        Q     Of a normal paper plate?               
 13        A     Correct.                               
 14        Q     Okay.  But you don't know the size of  
 15   it prior to you smearing it?                      
 16        A     No, ma'am.                             
 17        Q     You were not looking down at the       
 18   ground when you were walking?                     
 19        A     No, ma'am.                             
 20        Q     And you did not see it prior to        
 21   walking?                                          
 22        A     No, ma'am.                             
00065
  1        Q     I mean you did not see it prior to     
  2   slipping?                                         
  3        A     No.                                    
  4        Q     Do you know whether it was coming from 
  5   any -- did you see any damaged product or         
  6   merchandise or any other debris on the ground     
  7   from which it could have come?                    
  8        A     No, ma'am.                             
  9        Q     Are you -- is it your belief that it   
 10   came from the Pepsi display?                      
 11              MR. SANDUL:  Objection as to her       
 12   belief, but go ahead and answer the question.

 17   the Pepsi display?                                
 18        A     No.                                    
 19        Q     Was it connected to any -- was the     
 20   smear connected to anything around it that would  
 21   lead you to believe from where it was coming?     
 22        A     No, ma'am.

 20        A     I wasn't looking.

  4        A     The Pepsi display and the area I

  6        Q     At the Columbia Wal-Mart on the date

 15        Q     The Pepsi display, if you look at      
 16   Deposition Exhibit 6, can you help orient me as   
 17   to where you would have been related to that      
 18   Pepsi display when the slip occurred?             
 19        A     Down this area.                        
 20        Q     Will you take that red pen and mark an 
 21   X where you were?  So what you have drawn is an X 
 22   to the right of the Pepsi display as to where you 
00077
  1   would have slipped?                               
  2        A     Yes.

  5        Q     In the photograph.  So you would have  
  6   been walking -- the entrance -- write "entrance"  
  7   wherever the door would have been so we can just  
  8   orient the photograph.                            
  9              So you were walking this way up the    
 10   aisle from the entrance next to the Pepsi         
 11   display?

 13        Q     And it's your recollection based on    
 14   where your X is you had almost passed the Pepsi   
 15   display before you slipped?                       
 16        A     No.                                    
 17        Q     Where were you in relation to the      
 18   Pepsi display then?                               
 19        A     Right to the end.  Right by the end.   
 20        Q     Okay.  So you hadn't passed it but     
 21   were close to passing it?                         
 22        A     Correct.                               
00078
  1        Q     Do you see anything else in these      
  2   photographs that looks like a smear or liquid on  
  3   the ground that you would have observed on the    
  4   day of the incident?                              
  5        A     It's hard to see.                      
  6              MR. SANDUL:  Don't guess.              
  7              THE WITNESS:  No.                      
  8   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  9        Q     So your answer to that question is no? 
 10        A     No.                                    
 11        Q     Your answer to Interrogatory Number 7  
 12   says that you are in possession of photographs of 
 13   the area taken by your attorney or your attorney  
 14   is in possession of photographs taken of the area 
 15   taken by your attorney on May 21st, 2019.  Do you 
 16   know where those photographs are?                 
 17              MR. SANDUL:  Didn't we provide that?   
 18   They're just in the inside of the store.  I'll    
 19   get them to you.                                  
 20              MS. ALEXANDER:  Will you?              
 21              MR. SANDUL:  For the record, if you    
 22   want to depose her later, it's just kind of a     
00079
  1   layout for me to remember.                        
  2              MS. ALEXANDER:  It wasn't -- it was    
  3   just of the entrance of the store?                
  4              MR. SANDUL:  Entrance and looking back 
  5   and forth so I could --                           
  6              MS. ALEXANDER:  Orient?                
  7              MR. SANDUL:  Because some Wal-Marts    
  8   are different than others.  I thought they were   
  9   attached.  Sorry.                                 
 10              MS. ALEXANDER:  I don't have those.    
 11   If you would provide those, that would be great.  
 12   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 13        Q     Were you with your attorney when he    
 14   took those photographs?                           
 15        A     Yes.                                   
 16              MS. ALEXANDER:  Okay.  I'll just       
 17   reserve the right to hold it open.  I don't think 
 18   I'll have to.  In case I do.                      
 19              MR. SANDUL:  I apologize.  I           
 20   thought -- when we identify them, I expect my     
 21   people to attach it and send it out.

  1        Q     Did you see anyone else slip that day? 
  2        A     No, ma'am.                             
  3        Q     So we're going to go back to now where 
  4   I stopped you before.  And you said that after    
  5   you slipped, you -- I think the next thing you    
  6   said you walked to the customer service desk?     
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     So how much time passed from the time  
  9   you slipped until when you walked to the customer 
 10   service desk?                                     
 11        A     I don't recall.                        
 12        Q     I mean approximately.                  
 13        A     Within seconds.                        
 14        Q     So pretty -- immediately you walked to 
 15   the customer service desk?                        
 16        A     Immediately.                           
 17        Q     Less than a minute.  Are we talking 30 
 18   seconds?                                          
 19        A     Less than a minute.                    
 20        Q     And for what reason did you go to the  
 21   customer service desk?                            
 22        A     Make them aware of the water -- the    
00081
  1   liquid on the floor.                              
  2        Q     Okay.  And with whom did you speak?    
  3        A     I don't recall the girl's name.  It    
  4   was a worker behind the desk, service desk.       
  5        Q     Okay.  Was it Jackie who's written on  
  6   this piece of paper?                              
  7        A     No, ma'am.                             
  8        Q     What -- was it your impression that    
  9   the woman you spoke with was an employee of       
 10   Wal-Mart?                                         
 11        A     Yes.                                   
 12        Q     She was behind the desk?               
 13        A     Yes.                                   
 14        Q     Was she wearing a name tag?            
 15        A     I don't recall.                        
 16        Q     Can you describe her?                  
 17        A     No.                                    
 18        Q     At all?                                
 19        A     No.                                    
 20        Q     What did you say to her?               
 21        A     I needed someone to come clean up      
 22   liquid on the floor because there was liquid on   
00082
  1   the floor.                                        
  2        Q     And what did she say?                  
  3        A     She was busy and would call someone.   
  4        Q     You remember what she said, but you    
  5   don't remember at all what she looked like?       
  6        A     I don't remember.  There was a couple  
  7   of them back there.                               
  8        Q     What happened next?                    
  9        A     I went back over to where the incident 
 10   occurred.                                         
 11        Q     You walked back over?                  
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     About how far was it from customer     
 14   service to where the incident was in feet?  Hold  
 15   that thought.                                     
 16              (Discussion off the record.)           
 17   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 18        Q     So you were -- I think my last         
 19   question was about how many feet was it from the  
 20   area of the incident to where you went to         
 21   customer service.                                 
 22        A     Twenty feet.                           
00083
  1        Q     And when you went back to the incident 
  2   area, why did you go back to the incident area?   
  3        A     There were other people coming in the  
  4   store.  I didn't want them to do what I just      
  5   done.                                             
  6        Q     So what did you do when you went back? 
  7        A     I had told the customers that would    
  8   come in to watch, that there was a wet floor      
  9   there.                                            
 10        Q     Okay.  And so how many times were      
 11   you -- how long were you doing that?              
 12        A     Probably a minute or two.              
 13        Q     And then what did you do next?         
 14        A     A lady came from the back, and she was 
 15   the manager.  She had blonde hair.  I explained   
 16   to her what had just happened, and she told me    
 17   she would be right back.                          
 18        Q     So this manager with the blonde hair,  
 19   she came within about one to two minutes of you   
 20   reporting it to customer service?                 
 21        A     Actually, she -- it was about five     
 22   minutes before she come up.                       
00084
  1        Q     And that -- that five-minute time      
  2   frame, you were standing at the incident area?    
  3        A     Yes.                                   
  4        Q     So when she -- when you told her what  
  5   happened, she said she would be back.  And did    
  6   she come back?                                    
  7        A     A young man came back.                 
  8        Q     Okay.  And what did he look like?      
  9        A     Brown hair, glasses.                   
 10        Q     And did you believe he worked for      
 11   Wal-Mart?                                         
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     Why?                                   
 14        A     Because his name tag -- I didn't get   
 15   his name.  His name -- he had a name tag that     
 16   said Wal-Mart on it.                              
 17        Q     But you don't know his name?           
 18        A     No.                                    
 19        Q     About how old was he?                  
 20        A     I would say mid 20s.                   
 21        Q     A white guy or some other race?        
 22        A     White.                                 
00085
  1        Q     What did he say to you, if anything?   
  2        A     He had a folder, and he had given me   
  3   an incident report to fill out.                   
  4        Q     Did he say anything to you?            
  5        A     No.                                    
  6        Q     Okay.  So what did you do?             
  7        A     We sat down on the bench and --        
  8        Q     Where was the bench?                   
  9        A     In front of the customer service.      
 10        Q     And what did you do?                   
 11        A     I filled out the incident report.      
 12        Q     Then what?                             
 13        A     From there, I went -- he told me that  
 14   that's all I had to fill out was a piece of       
 15   paper.                                            
 16        Q     Did he offer you any medical           
 17   assistance?                                       
 18        A     No.  He -- no.                         
 19        Q     He didn't offer you any medical        
 20   assistance at all?                                
 21        A     No.                                    
 22        Q     Did you ask for medical assistance?    
00086
  1        A     No.                                    
  2        Q     Did you tell him anything?             
  3        A     No.                                    
  4        Q     He just gave you the paper.  You       
  5   filled it out and then gave it back to him, and   
  6   then your interaction with him was over?          
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     Then what did you do after you gave    
  9   him the paper?  What did you do after you ended   
 10   your interaction with him?                        
 11        A     I went to urgent care.                 
 12        Q     Well, did you stay at the Wal-Mart?    
 13        A     No.                                    
 14        Q     You immediately left?                  
 15        A     Yes.                                   
 16        Q     Did you return the T-shirt?            
 17        A     I did.                                 
 18        Q     Okay.  So you returned the T-shirt     
 19   before you left?                                  
 20        A     Yes.                                   
 21        Q     So that's what I'm trying to just go   
 22   in those fragments.  So you ended your            
00087
  1   interaction with the gentleman and you did what?  
  2        A     I went to urgent care.                 
  3        Q     Okay.  When did you return the         
  4   T-shirt?                                          
  5        A     Waiting for him to come back up.       
  6        Q     So then let's go back to that.  When   
  7   you were waiting, the blonde female manager left, 
  8   and then about how much longer was it until the   
  9   young man came back with the folder?              
 10        A     It was a good while.  Approximately -- 
 11   I don't recall right offhand.                     
 12        Q     Was it a matter of some minutes?       
 13        A     Yes.  It's been a good couple minutes. 
 14        Q     So approximately a couple of minutes   
 15   until the gentleman came back?                    
 16        A     About five.                            
 17        Q     And in that couple of minutes to five  
 18   minutes, you did what?                            
 19        A     Returned the shirt.                    
 20        Q     Where did you return the T-shirt?      
 21        A     At customer service.                   
 22        Q     And that was your plan when you came   
00088
  1   to the Wal-Mart to return the T-shirt?            
  2        A     Correct.                               
  3        Q     So with whom did you do that           
  4   transaction, if you know?                         
  5        A     I don't know.                          
  6        Q     Did you get a receipt for that         
  7   transaction?                                      
  8        A     No.                                    
  9        Q     You weren't given a receipt?           
 10        A     No.                                    
 11        Q     Did you do anything else other than -- 
 12   any other business at Wal-Mart other than         
 13   returning the T-shirt?                            
 14        A     No.                                    
 15        Q     Then after you gave the paper back to  
 16   the gentleman, you're saying you turned around    
 17   and walked out of the store?                      
 18        A     Correct.                               
 19        Q     And you went to urgent care?

  1        Q     Did you call anybody?                  
  2        A     No.  I was on the phone with my son.

  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     So you previously told me you were     
  9   holding your purse and your shopping bag with the

 13   phone -- with your son when you were walking in

 15        A     Yes.                                   
 16        Q     How were you holding your cell phone?  
 17   In your right hand?  You're demonstrating?        
 18        A     Yes.                                   
 19        Q     What kind of phone was it?             
 20        A     My cell phone.                         
 21        Q     Is it like an iPhone or Android?       
 22        A     An Android.                            
00090
  1        Q     So you were holding your cell phone in 
  2   your right hand and your purse and the bag in     
  3   your left hand?                                   
  4        A     Yes, ma'am.                            
  5        Q     You weren't using a Bluetooth.  You    
  6   were actually holding your phone?                 
  7        A     Correct.                               
  8        Q     Whatever made you think then you were  
  9   pushing a shopping cart?                          
 10        A     I normally get one when I go in, and   
 11   if I find a good one outside that doesn't have a  
 12   floppy wheel, then I bring it in with me.  But I  
 13   hadn't grabbed one coming across the parking lot  
 14   that morning.                                     
 15        Q     But you specifically remember you were 
 16   holding your cell phone in your right hand        
 17   talking to your son and holding your purse and    
 18   your bag in your left hand walking in, but you    
 19   still thought, until you saw the video, that you  
 20   were using a shopping cart?                       
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     So were you still -- at what point did 
00091
  1   you end the conversation with your son?           
  2        A     After I had slipped.                   
  3        Q     You did what?  You told your son what? 
  4        A     When I slipped, he said, "Mom, are you 
  5   all right?" because I -- I guess I had reacted in 
  6   a way that he knew something was wrong.  And I    
  7   said, "No, I'm fine."  I said, "I slipped.  There 
  8   was something on the floor."  And he's, like,     
  9   "Are you okay?"  And I said, "Yes."  I said,      
 10   "Thank God for the Pepsi display."                
 11        Q     Which son was this?                    
 12        A     Ronald.                                
 13        Q     Did you -- and then what did you do    
 14   when your conversation with your son -- is that   
 15   when it ended?                                    
 16        A     I hung up, yeah.                       
 17        Q     Okay.  So when you got in your car to  
 18   drive yourself to urgent care, did you call       
 19   anyone?                                           
 20        A     No.                                    
 21        Q     Did you call anyone while you were     
 22   walking to your car?                              
00092
  1        A     No.                                    
  2        Q     You just drove yourself to urgent      
  3   care?                                             
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     And what did you do when you got to    
  6   urgent care?                                      
  7        A     I saw a doctor.                        
  8        Q     And what did you tell them?            
  9        A     That I had slipped.                    
 10        Q     What were your complaints, if          
 11   anything?

 15        Q     Okay.  Did you have any visible        
 16   injuries to your body?                            
 17        A     My ankle had started swelling.         
 18        Q     Anything else?                         
 19        A     No, ma'am.                             
 20        Q     No -- no lacerations, no bleeding, no  
 21   bruising, correct?

 10        Q     What do you recognize that to be?      
 11        A     My report I filled out.                
 12        Q     So Exhibit 11 is your signature -- is  
 13   your signature on Exhibit 11?                     
 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15        Q     Where it says customer/member

 22        Q     Can you read the -- is it your         
00095
  1   handwriting where it says, "Describe in your own  
  2   words the event leading up to the incident," in   
  3   the middle of the page?                           
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     And can you read, please, what you     
  6   wrote?                                            
  7        A     "When I entered the store, as I got to 
  8   the end of the aisle by the carts, I slipped on   
  9   water on the floor, twisted my back and ankle."   
 10        Q     It says, "end of the aisle by the      
 11   cart."  What do you mean by "the cart"?           
 12        A     The -- on the other side of the Pepsi  
 13   display, that's where they keep all their carts.  
 14        Q     It's like the cart corral?             
 15        A     Yes.  When I filled this out, I had    
 16   asked the gentleman that gave me the paper what   
 17   they called that aisle because I wanted to be --  
 18   make sure I had the right thing down.  He said    
 19   they call it the cart aisle.  So that's what I    
 20   put.                                              
 21        Q     Before we talked about did you and he  
 22   say anything to each other, you told me you       
00096
  1   didn't.  But now you recall that you asked him    
  2   what the aisle was called?                        
  3        A     I thought you meant after.  I'm sorry. 
  4   Yes.                                              
  5        Q     Did you say anything else to that      
  6   gentleman or did he say anything else to you?     
  7        A     He told me he couldn't tell me what to 
  8   write.  And I said to him, "I don't need you to   
  9   tell me what to write.  I just need to know what  
 10   you call that aisle."  And he said, "The cart     
 11   aisle."                                           
 12        Q     Had you asked him what to write?       
 13        A     No.                                    
 14        Q     Any other conversation the two of you  
 15   had?                                              
 16        A     That was it.                           
 17        Q     Any other conversation with any other  
 18   Wal-Mart employee --                              
 19        A     No.                                    
 20        Q     -- about this incident?                
 21        A     He told me it would take three days    
 22   for somebody to get to me, and I left.

  2        Q     Why were you taking photographs of     
  3   your back?                                        
  4        A     Because it had swollen.                
  5        Q     You're saying there's swelling in the  
  6   photographs you took?                             
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     Now in the top left photograph, the    
  9   first photograph of your back on the first page,  
 10   there is a scar that is depicted there on what I  
 11   would say is your spine.

 16        Q     So going to the second page of Exhibit 
 17   12, are these more pictures of your foot and your 
 18   back taken on June -- they might be the same --   
 19   actually I think they might be duplicates of the

  4   black flip-flops you're wearing, are those the    
  5   flip-flops you were wearing at the time of the

  2   you took the photographs?

  4        Q     I'm going to show you what I marked as 
  5   Exhibit 13 and 14 which I will represent to you   
  6   are screenshots from the video surveillance       
  7   camera that was provided to you in discovery and  
  8   you indicated previously that you watched.        
  9   Showing you Exhibit 13, do you see yourself in    
 10   Exhibit 13?

 13   your body.  So that's in Exhibit 13, which is a   
 14   June 8, 2018, screenshot at 12:47 and 16 seconds  
 15   p.m.  You circled -- you're the woman with the    
 16   blonde hair and the black sleeveless shirt and    
 17   black shorts?

 19        Q     And at that moment you are holding     
 20   your right hand up to your right ear talking on   
 21   the phone, and your left hand is carrying the     
 22   shopping bag and your pocketbook?                 
00103
  1        A     Correct.                               
  2        Q     Now, showing you Exhibit 14, do you    
  3   see yourself in Exhibit 14 which is taken at --   
  4   captured at 12:47 and 28 seconds?

  6        Q     Can you please circle yourself.  Same  
  7   woman obviously, black shorts, black flip-flops,  
  8   back shirt sleeveless.                            
  9              Have you currently finished your       
 10   medical treatment related to the claimed injuries 
 11   in this case?                                     
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     If the incident occurred in June 18,   
 14   2018, when did you complete your treatment for    
 15   what you're claiming was the injury in this case? 
 16        A     December.                              
 17        Q     So the early part of December?         
 18        A     Yes.                                   
 19        Q     Of 2018?                               
 20        A     Correct.                               
 21              MR. SANDUL:  Just for the record, it's 
 22   the last visit she had.  I think it was to        
00104
  1   Premier, correct?  Was it Premier?                
  2              THE WITNESS:  The Dr. Parks was my --  
  3              MR. SANDUL:  I know.                   
  4              MS. ALEXANDER:  The records will speak 
  5   for themselves.                                   
  6              MR. SANDUL:  I just didn't want you to 
  7   have to waste a lot of time.                      
  8   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  9        Q     It's December -- early December 2018   
 10   is the last time you obtained treatment related   
 11   to this incident; is that correct?                
 12        A     Correct.                               
 13        Q     Okay.  And do you have any             
 14   appointments planned now?                         
 15        A     No.                                    
 16        Q     Do you expect to make any medical      
 17   appointments related to this incident?            
 18        A     No.                                    
 19              MR. SANDUL:  Let me just object        
 20   because you can't foresee the future.  Her        
 21   present --                                        
 22   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
00105
  1        Q     As you sit here today, in your mind    
  2   are you like "Oh, I've got to go home and make a  
  3   medical appointment," or right now as you sit     
  4   here today do you have any expectations of making 
  5   any appointments?                                 
  6        A     No.                                    
  7        Q     When is the first time that you claim  
  8   you experienced any injury or pain from this      
  9   incident?                                         
 10        A     June 8th.                              
 11        Q     And at what point?                     
 12        A     I don't understand.                    
 13        Q     So did you experience the pain         
 14   immediately or was it some time later that you    
 15   experienced the pain?  Was it the next day?       
 16   Sometimes people manifest pain in different       
 17   timelines.                                        
 18        A     It was at the incident.                
 19        Q     So how quickly after the incident did  
 20   you experience pain?                              
 21        A     Right away.                            
 22        Q     And where did you experience pain      
00106
  1   right away?                                       
  2        A     My ankle.                              
  3        Q     Okay.                                  
  4        A     And my lower back, my hip.             
  5        Q     Was it your right ankle?               
  6        A     Yes.                                   
  7        Q     Are you claiming injury to any other   
  8   part of your body from this incident other than   
  9   your right ankle, your lower back, and your right 
 10   hip?                                              
 11        A     No.                                    
 12        Q     Those are the three parts of your body 
 13   from which you're claiming were injured as a      
 14   result of this incident?                          
 15        A     Correct.                               
 16        Q     So you have produced in discovery      
 17   2,250 pages of medical records and many -- some   
 18   of those medical records are from before this     
 19   incident, which is normal and to be expected.  I  
 20   don't intend to sit here and take you through,    
 21   unless you want to, 2,250 pages of medical        
 22   records, but I do need to ask you about a lot of  
00107
  1   that.                                             
  2              So I'm going to do my best to, in an   
  3   organized way, take you through that.  But at any 
  4   point if you need to expand or clarify or correct 
  5   me or add anything, please feel free.  I don't    
  6   intend to bulldoze through this.  I just intend   
  7   to do it efficiently.  Is that fair enough?       
  8        A     Yes.                                   
  9              MR. SANDUL:  Can I also state for the  
 10   record, since I got in the case relatively late,  
 11   we're still looking for records.  So we've still  
 12   got requests out.  So there are probably more     
 13   coming.                                           
 14              MS. ALEXANDER:  From different         
 15   providers?                                        
 16              MR. SANDUL:  I noticed a couple like   
 17   urgent cares in there from prior incidents and    
 18   stuff.  Nothing from this as far as I know.       
 19   Nothing related to the treatment for this         
 20   occurrence.                                       
 21              MS. ALEXANDER:  Preexisting?           
 22              MR. SANDUL:  Yeah.  I normally have    
00108
  1   all that before I file suit, but as you know,     
  2   suit was already filed before the case was        
  3   transferred to me.                                
  4              MS. ALEXANDER:  So we'll hold the      
  5   deposition open.  Your attorney is still          
  6   gathering records.  They're extensive for         
  7   preexisting.  So if I need to come back and ask   
  8   you more questions about those, we will.  Let's   
  9   hope I don't have to.  I'm going to do my best    
 10   today, okay.                                      
 11              THE WITNESS:  Okay.                    
 12   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 13        Q     So I have that you went to University  
 14   of Maryland what they call immediate care on June 
 15   the 8th, 2018.  Is that where you went for urgent 
 16   care?                                             
 17        A     Correct.                               
 18        Q     And where is that located?             
 19        A     On Waterloo Road.                      
 20        Q     In Columbia?                           
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     Was that the closest urgent care, or   
00109
  1   is there some other reason why you picked that    
  2   place?                                            
  3        A     That's -- that was on my way home.  It 
  4   was close.                                        
  5        Q     And what is your understanding of what 
  6   they diagnosed you with at urgent care?           
  7        A     Sprained ankle, pulled muscles in the  
  8   lower back and the hip and leg.                   
  9        Q     Your right hip?                        
 10        A     Yes.                                   
 11        Q     What about your leg?                   
 12        A     Just the problems that I had pain      
 13   coming down my leg.                               
 14        Q     Okay.  And how did you get home from   
 15   the urgent care?                                  
 16        A     I drove.                               
 17        Q     Did you go anywhere -- when you left   
 18   urgent care, where did you go?                    
 19        A     Home.                                  
 20        Q     So what time did you arrive home       
 21   approximately?                                    
 22        A     I don't recall.                        
00110
  1        Q     How far of a drive is it from urgent   
  2   care to your home?                                
  3        A     About half a mile.                     
  4        Q     So pretty quickly you got home?        
  5        A     Yes.                                   
  6        Q     No one came up to the urgent care?     
  7   None of your family or friends came up to the     
  8   urgent care?                                      
  9        A     No.                                    
 10        Q     I believe the next treatment provider  
 11   you saw related to this claim was Maryland        
 12   Healthcare Clinics; is that correct?              
 13        A     Correct.                               
 14        Q     Where are they located?                
 15        A     Lark Brown Road.                       
 16        Q     Why did you go there?                  
 17              MR. SANDUL:  Let me object because     
 18   it's going to get into attorney-client.  I'm      
 19   going to let you answer it here but preserve it   
 20   for any trial we have.                            
 21   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 22        Q     Don't tell me what your attorney said. 
00111
  1   Mr. Sandul is right.  But did you go there        
  2   because you were --                               
  3              MR. SANDUL:  You can ask her.  I'm     
  4   just preserving in case.                          
  5              MS. ALEXANDER:  I don't want -- if     
  6   it's not a fair question, I don't want to have    
  7   her answer.                                       
  8   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  9        Q     Is that your primary care physician's  
 10   office?                                           
 11        A     No.                                    
 12        Q     You went there upon advice.  Fair      
 13   enough?                                           
 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15        Q     And I have the date you went there was 
 16   June the 12th; is that right?                     
 17        A     Yes.                                   
 18        Q     And what treatment were you seeking    
 19   there?                                            
 20        A     I went for evaluation, physical        
 21   therapist.                                        
 22        Q     Had you seen your primary care         
00112
  1   physician at that point?                          
  2        A     No.                                    
  3        Q     Had you seen any other medical         
  4   provider other than the urgent care before you    
  5   went to the physical therapy at Maryland          
  6   Healthcare Clinics?                               
  7        A     No.                                    
  8        Q     And you were receiving physical        
  9   therapy there for how long?                       
 10        A     One day.                               
 11        Q     Why did you only stay there one day?   
 12        A     I didn't feel comfortable there.       
 13        Q     Why?                                   
 14        A     I had went there prior.                
 15        Q     Prior to this incident?                
 16        A     And it didn't help.  Years, yes.       
 17        Q     Okay.  And what about that experience  
 18   made you not feel comfortable to get treatment    
 19   there in June of 2018?                            
 20        A     I couldn't understand the doctor that  
 21   was there at the time.                            
 22        Q     Okay.  Was an evaluation completed?    
00113
  1        A     Yes.                                   
  2        Q     And did they come up with a treatment  
  3   plan?                                             
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     And what was that treatment plan?      
  6        A     I don't recall.                        
  7        Q     Do you know the broad strokes of it?   
  8   Was it like three times a week for six weeks,     
  9   something like that, or do you just not remember? 
 10        A     I didn't go back.                      
 11        Q     But you don't remember what they told  
 12   you the treatment plan would be after the         
 13   evaluation?                                       
 14        A     I don't.                               
 15        Q     Did you call them and cancel an        
 16   appointment, or did you just never schedule an    
 17   appointment to return?                            
 18        A     I didn't schedule to return.           
 19        Q     Where is the next place that you       
 20   received treatment?                               
 21        A     Premier Orthopedics.                   
 22        Q     And for what reason did you go to      
00114
  1   Premier Orthopedics?                              
  2        A     Therapy.                               
  3        Q     And how did you get referred there?    
  4        A     I -- I went there prior.               
  5        Q     So you self-referred there from your   
  6   previous experience?                              
  7        A     Correct.                               
  8        Q     Had you contacted your primary care    
  9   physician at this point?                          
 10        A     I called and made an appointment.      
 11        Q     And who is your primary care           
 12   physician?                                        
 13        A     Dr. Salvacion Ramirez.                 
 14        Q     So the first name I have it written    
 15   here the long way.  What did you call him or her? 
 16        A     Dr. Sally.                             
 17        Q     It's a woman?                          
 18        A     Short for Salvacion, yeah.             
 19        Q     So we'll call her -- I think the       
 20   real --                                           
 21        A     Dr. Salvacion.                         
 22        Q     The full spelling of her first name is 
00115
  1   S-A-L-V-A-C-I-O-N.  And her last name is Ramirez? 
  2        A     Correct.                               
  3        Q     So you -- when did you call and make   
  4   an appointment with your primary care physician,  
  5   Dr. Ramirez?                                      
  6        A     I went in --                           
  7        Q     When did you call to make the          
  8   appointment?                                      
  9        A     I don't recall.                        
 10        Q     Was it before or after you went to     
 11   Premier Orthopedics?                              
 12        A     After.                                 
 13        Q     Okay.  So I'm sorry if I was confused. 
 14   We were talking about Premier Orthopedics, and I  
 15   asked you -- you hadn't yet been to your primary  
 16   care physician.  And you said well I had called   
 17   to make an appointment.  You had not called to    
 18   make an appointment before going to Premier       
 19   Orthopedics?                                      
 20        A     No.                                    
 21        Q     So you called to make an appointment   
 22   with your primary care physician after you went   
00116
  1   to Premier Orthopedics?                           
  2        A     Correct.                               
  3        Q     My record reflects that you went to    
  4   Premier Orthopedics on June 13th, 2018, for the   
  5   first time.  Does that sound right to you?        
  6        A     Yes.                                   
  7        Q     And what treatment did you receive at  
  8   Premier Orthopedics?                              
  9        A     I was evaluated and then given a       
 10   therapy slip.                                     
 11        Q     Physical therapy?                      
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And you didn't need a referral to go   
 14   to Premier Orthopedics before being treated       
 15   there?                                            
 16        A     No.                                    
 17        Q     How long did you obtain physical       
 18   therapy at Premier Orthopedics?                   
 19        A     Until July the 10th.                   
 20        Q     So for approximately 30 days you did   
 21   therapy?                                          
 22        A     Yes.                                   
00117
  1        Q     With what frequency?                   
  2        A     Three times a week.                    
  3        Q     Did you miss any appointments?         
  4        A     No, ma'am.                             
  5        Q     And after that 30 days approximately,  
  6   did you have an evaluation again with the         
  7   orthopedist there?                                
  8        A     I had surgery.                         
  9        Q     Okay.  Some doctor must have evaluated 
 10   you after your physical therapy to say whether or 
 11   not surgery was needed or am I wrong?  Maybe I'm  
 12   wrong.  Who told you you needed surgery?          
 13        A     Dr. Parks.                             
 14        Q     And where does Dr. Parks practice      
 15   medicine?                                         
 16        A     In Glen Burnie.                        
 17        Q     Do you know his practice name?         
 18        A     He's a neurologist, Dr. Charles Parks. 
 19        Q     Is he at Mercy?                        
 20        A     Yes, he is now.                        
 21        Q     So maybe my question wasn't phrased    
 22   well.  Were you seeing Dr. Parks at the same time 
00118
  1   you were getting PT -- physical therapy at        
  2   Premier Orthopedics?                              
  3        A     Yes.                                   
  4        Q     Okay.  So you had essentially an       
  5   evaluation at Premier Orthopedics for physical    
  6   therapy, and then you had a course of physical    
  7   therapy there.  But at the same time we're seeing 
  8   Dr. Parks at Mercy who was evaluating whether you 
  9   needed surgery?                                   
 10        A     Yes.                                   
 11        Q     You had previously been operated on by 
 12   Dr. Parks; is that right?                         
 13        A     Correct.                               
 14        Q     Is his last name Parks or Park?  You   
 15   don't know?                                       
 16              MR. SANDUL:  It's Park.                
 17   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 18        Q     Dr. Park had operated on your back     
 19   previous to this incident at Wal-Mart, correct?   
 20        A     Correct.                               
 21        Q     How many times had Dr. Park previously 
 22   operated on your back?                            
00119
  1        A     Three, four -- four.                   
  2        Q     What part of your back had Dr. Park    
  3   previously operated on?                           
  4        A     The lower back.                        
  5        Q     Were all of his previous back          
  6   surgeries on you for your lower back?             
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     And for what reason -- what was the    
  9   diagnosis that caused you to have four previous   
 10   back surgeries by Dr. Park on your lower back?    
 11        A     The first time I had a bulging disk.   
 12        Q     Do you know approximately what year?   
 13        A     It was in early 2000.  I don't recall  
 14   exactly what year.                                
 15        Q     And what was the second time -- second 
 16   surgery?                                          
 17        A     He put a rod on the right side.        
 18        Q     Was it a laminectomy?  Does that sound 
 19   familiar or no?  So the second surgery he placed  
 20   some hardware in your back?                       
 21        A     Correct.                               
 22        Q     And approximately what year was that?  
00120
  1        A     Oh, my goodness.                       
  2        Q     And again, this isn't a trick          
  3   question.  It's in your medical records.          
  4        A     2003 I believe, maybe '4.              
  5        Q     What was the purpose of your third     
  6   back surgery?                                     
  7        A     I had a car accident.                  
  8        Q     What year was that?                    
  9        A     2006.                                  
 10        Q     Is that the same year he did your      
 11   third back surgery?                               
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And for what reason did you -- what    
 14   medical reason did you need to have back surgery  
 15   in 2006?                                          
 16        A     He put -- had to put hardware on the   
 17   other side as well for support.                   
 18        Q     And what was the fourth back surgery   
 19   he performed?                                     
 20        A     This last one.                         
 21        Q     I'll help you phone a friend here.  I  
 22   think you had one in 2014.  Actually, I know you  
00121
  1   did.                                              
  2        A     That's when he put the other side on.  
  3        Q     I thought you told me that was 2006.   
  4        A     2006 was my neck.                      
  5        Q     The fusion?                            
  6        A     Sorry, yes.                            
  7        Q     Okay.  So in 2006 you had a lumbar     
  8   cervical fusion, I believe; is that right?        
  9        A     Yes.                                   
 10        Q     And then in 2014 is when you had the   
 11   additional hardware from the motor vehicle        
 12   accident?                                         
 13        A     Correct.                               
 14        Q     So in 2018, that was the fifth time    
 15   Dr. Park decided to do back surgery on you?       
 16        A     Yes.                                   
 17        Q     And he made that decision to do back   
 18   surgery -- I believe the surgery was done on July 
 19   the 11th, 2018, at Mercy where he practices; is   
 20   that correct?                                     
 21        A     Correct.                               
 22        Q     For what reason did he tell you you    
00122
  1   needed back surgery on July 11th, 2018?           
  2        A     He had to put -- he had to go up a     
  3   level, above where he had done the priors.  The   
  4   disk above that was -- had been protruding and    
  5   pinched.                                          
  6        Q     Okay.  Did he give you a medical       
  7   reason why he needed to do a fifth back surgery   
  8   in 2018?                                          
  9        A     No.                                    
 10        Q     Have you ever looked at any of your    
 11   medical records from that surgery, like the       
 12   operative note or the pre- or postoperative       
 13   diagnosis?                                        
 14        A     No.                                    
 15        Q     So let's go back to Premier            
 16   Orthopedics for a moment.  Let me ask you this.   
 17   Who's, if you know, Dr. Thelma Lopes or Lopez?    
 18   L-O-P-E-S.  Maybe she's not a doctor.             
 19        A     From Mercy, I think she was part of    
 20   the team.                                         
 21        Q     Is she a physician as far as you know? 
 22        A     She was his assistant.                 
00123
  1        Q     So maybe she's his physician           
  2   assistant.  Did you see her prior to your back    
  3   surgery or you saw her in follow-up?              
  4        A     No.  At the time of the -- at the      
  5   hospital.                                         
  6        Q     Okay.  So she was providing you        
  7   medical care while you were at the hospital from  
  8   the July 11th back surgery?                       
  9        A     Correct.                               
 10        Q     But she works with Dr. Park at his     
 11   office?                                           
 12        A     Correct.                               
 13        Q     Okay.                                  
 14        A     The hospital, I believe.               
 15        Q     So the medical providers that I have   
 16   that treated you for the claimed injuries at      
 17   Wal-Mart are the University of Maryland Immediate 
 18   Care, Maryland Healthcare Clinics one day,        
 19   Premier Orthopedics, Dr. Sally Ramirez.  I know   
 20   you got your films at Advanced Radiology.  Dr.    
 21   Park and Mercy Medical Center.  We'll put Ms.     
 22   Lopes in with him.                                
00124
  1        A     Yes.                                   
  2        Q     And then you had at-home care with I   
  3   think Kindred?                                    
  4        A     Correct.                               
  5        Q     Are there any other medical providers  
  6   from which you say you received care for the      
  7   claimed injuries at Wal-Mart?                     
  8        A     No, ma'am.                             
  9        Q     So then let's go back to Premier       
 10   Orthopedics where you self-referred for physical  
 11   therapy.                                          
 12               (Deposition Exhibit Number 15 was     
 13   marked for identification and retained by         
 14   counsel.)                                         
 15   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 16        Q     I'm going to show you a record, their  
 17   initial consultation with you on June 13th, 2018, 
 18   which I will mark as Deposition Exhibit 15, and   
 19   it is Bates stamped as Murphy-115 through -117    
 20   and ask you to take a look.                       
 21              Have you seen Deposition Exhibit 15    
 22   before, which is your consultation note from      
00125
  1   Premier dated June 13th?                          
  2        A     No.                                    
  3        Q     I'm going to direct you to the second  
  4   sentence of the first paragraph where it is       
  5   stated by the physician or physician's assistant  
  6   who wrote this, "The patient states she was at    
  7   Wal-Mart pushing a cart when she slipped on a wet 
  8   floor."  Do you see that sentence?                
  9        A     Yes.                                   
 10        Q     It goes on to say, "Her right leg went 
 11   forward.  She was able to catch herself on the    
 12   cart so she did not fall all the way to the       
 13   ground.  However, her body twisted and got        
 14   wrenched during the slip and fall."  Did I read   
 15   that accurately?                                  
 16        A     Yes.                                   
 17        Q     Did you tell the health care provider  
 18   at Premier Orthopedics on June 13th, 2018, that   
 19   you were pushing a shopping cart and used it to   
 20   catch yourself so you didn't fall all the way to  
 21   the ground?                                       
 22        A     Yes.                                   
00126
  1        Q     For what reason on June 13th would you 
  2   have told them that you were pushing a cart and   
  3   used it to catch yourself?                        
  4        A     I believed I had had a cart with me.   
  5        Q     Five days after the incident you       
  6   believed you had a cart with you?                 
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     Because that's a very specific memory. 
  9   Did they accurately record what you told them --  
 10        A     Yes.                                   
 11        Q     -- in Exhibit 15?                      
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And that you had to catch yourself on  
 14   the cart to avoid falling to the ground?          
 15        A     And the Pepsi display.                 
 16        Q     Well, I'm asking about Exhibit 15.     
 17        A     I'm sorry.                             
 18        Q     You told them you had to catch         
 19   yourself on the cart so you did not fall to the   
 20   ground?                                           
 21        A     Correct.                               
 22        Q     Causing your body to twist by holding  
00127
  1   onto the cart at the same time you were trying to 
  2   avoid falling to the ground?                      
  3        A     Correct.                               
  4        Q     That's what you told your physician    
  5   that day?                                         
  6        A     Correct.                               
  7               (Deposition Exhibit Number 16 was     
  8   marked for identification and retained by         
  9   counsel.)                                         
 10   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 11        Q     I'm now going to show you what I will  
 12   mark as Deposition Exhibit 16, which is Bates     
 13   stamped Murphy-158 and -159 and ask you to take a 
 14   look at that.  I will represent to you as the     
 15   Bates marks confirm that it is a two-page medical 
 16   record from your primary care physician, Dr.      
 17   Sally Ramirez, dated June the 15th, 2018, which   
 18   would have been about seven days after the date   
 19   of the incident and ask you to look at the middle 
 20   of the page where she writes what you told her    
 21   was your problem and that she wrote "59-year-old  
 22   female came in for follow-up visit after she fell 
00128
  1   at Wal-Mart on water puddle.  She was holding,"   
  2   it says into, I think she meant onto, "the cart   
  3   for support but twisted her back and ankle to     
  4   avoid falling backward."  Do you see where Dr.    
  5   Ramirez wrote that?                               
  6        A     Yes.                                   
  7        Q     Is that what you told Dr. Ramirez      
  8   seven days after the accident or the incident at  
  9   Wal-Mart?                                         
 10        A     Yes.                                   
 11        Q     And why would you have told Dr.        
 12   Ramirez that you were holding onto a cart for     
 13   support but twisted your back?                    
 14        A     I thought I had a cart.                
 15        Q     So one week after the incident you     
 16   thought you had a cart?                           
 17        A     Yes.                                   
 18        Q     Okay.  And if there were other         
 19   references to other folks contained in your       
 20   medical records that you -- your injury involved  
 21   when you were holding onto a cart and trying to   
 22   avoid falling and that caused you to twist, that  
00129
  1   would be incorrect because you didn't have a      
  2   cart, right?                                      
  3        A     Correct.                               
  4        Q     Why did you go see Dr. Ramirez on June 
  5   15th if you were already in treatment with        
  6   Premier Orthopedics on June 13th?                 
  7        A     She's my primary care doctor.          
  8        Q     Any other reason?                      
  9        A     Well, I wanted to get her opinion on   
 10   things.                                           
 11        Q     The Neurontin 100 milligrams, is that  
 12   what you're calling the Gabapentin?               
 13        A     Yes.                                   
 14        Q     And that according to your primary     
 15   care physician's record states that you're        
 16   prescribed that three 100 milligram pills at      
 17   bedtime, and in the morning it says PRN, which I  
 18   believe means as needed.                          
 19              Is that your understanding of your     
 20   prescription for the Gabapentin also known as     
 21   Neurontin?                                        
 22        A     Just at bedtime.                       
00130
  1        Q     So you don't take it in the morning as 
  2   needed according to your records?                 
  3        A     No.                                    
  4        Q     The operative note written by Dr. Park 
  5   for your surgery on July the 11th, 2018, says     
  6   that the pre-operative diagnosis and the          
  7   postoperative diagnosis are the same, that it's   
  8   spinal spondylosis and spinal stenosis.  Have you 
  9   heard those two diagnoses before?                 
 10        A     No.                                    
 11        Q     No doctor you've ever seen or          
 12   orthopedic surgeon, including Dr. Park who's      
 13   operated on you five times, had talked to you     
 14   about your history of spinal stenosis and spinal  
 15   spondylosis?                                      
 16        A     No.                                    
 17        Q     Have they talked to you about          
 18   degenerative spinal problems that you have been   
 19   diagnosed with?                                   
 20        A     Yes.                                   
 21        Q     Who has talked to you about that?      
 22        A     It's in my files.  Dr. Park and Dr.

  2        Q     And Dr. Park talked to you about your  
  3   degenerative back issues prior to the incident at 
  4   Wal-Mart or after?                                
  5        A     After.                                 
  6        Q     And what did he say?                   
  7        A     He didn't mention any of it.           
  8        Q     Well, you just told me he talked to    
  9   you about your degenerative back problems after   
 10   the incident at Wal-Mart, right?                  
 11        A     The degenerative disk?                 
 12        Q     Yes.                                   
 13        A     Yes.                                   
 14        Q     So what did he say?                    
 15        A     He didn't say anything about it        
 16   afterwards.                                       
 17        Q     Okay.  Did Dr. Park talk to you about  
 18   your degenerative disk disease?                   
 19        A     No.                                    
 20        Q     Okay.  You told me that a doctor       
 21   talked to you about your degenerative back        
 22   problems; is that right?                          
00132
  1        A     Correct.                               
  2        Q     Who talked to you about that?          
  3        A     Dr. Sally and Dr. Park.                
  4        Q     When did Dr. Park talk to you about    
  5   that?                                             
  6        A     Years earlier.                         
  7        Q     So prior to your surgery on July 11th, 
  8   2018, Dr. Park had talked to you about your       
  9   degenerative back problems?                       
 10        A     Yes.                                   
 11        Q     What did he say?                       
 12        A     I have degenerative disk disease.      
 13        Q     Do you know when you were diagnosed    
 14   with degenerative disk disease?                   
 15        A     I don't recall.                        
 16        Q     Was that a diagnosis that caused one   
 17   of your four previous back surgeries?             
 18        A     No.                                    
 19        Q     Do you know the diagnosis that caused  
 20   any of your four previous back surgeries?         
 21        A     I had protruded disks the first time.  
 22   It's domino effects from there.                   
00133
  1        Q     You don't recall any other             
  2   conversation with Dr. Park about your             
  3   degenerative disk disease?                        
  4        A     No.                                    
  5        Q     Did he tell you how you got to have    
  6   degenerative disk disease?                        
  7        A     No.                                    
  8        Q     Do you have any understanding as to    
  9   what that means?                                  
 10        A     No.                                    
 11        Q     You said Dr. Sally Ramirez also talked 
 12   to you about your degenerative back problems; is  
 13   that right?                                       
 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15        Q     Did she talk to you about those before 
 16   or after the incident at Wal-Mart?                
 17        A     They were before.  No conversation --  
 18   I mean, it wasn't a discussion that we had on it. 
 19   It's in my file.                                  
 20        Q     Yes, right.                            
 21        A     I never discussed any of it.           
 22        Q     Okay.  And if you didn't discuss it,   
00134
  1   that's fine.  When you tell me you discussed it   
  2   and then tell me you didn't discuss it, that's    
  3   where I'm getting confused.                       
  4        A     Okay.                                  
  5        Q     Did you discuss your degenerative back 
  6   problems with Dr. Sally Ramirez?                  
  7        A     No.                                    
  8        Q     So you never talked about your         
  9   degenerative back problems with Dr. Sally         
 10   Ramirez?                                          
 11        A     I'm confused.                          
 12        Q     Let me try to be more clear.  Dr.      
 13   Sally Ramirez is your primary care physician?     
 14        A     Correct.                               
 15        Q     She's been your primary care physician 
 16   for how long?                                     
 17        A     Eight years.                           
 18        Q     In the past eight years, so from 2011  
 19   to present, have you ever talked with Dr. Ramirez 
 20   about degenerative back problems?                 
 21        A     No.                                    
 22        Q     Okay.  Have you ever talked with Dr.   
00135
  1   Sally Ramirez about any back problems?            
  2        A     Yes.                                   
  3        Q     What problems?                         
  4        A     The pain that I have.                  
  5        Q     Did you talk to her about that before  
  6   the incident at Wal-Mart?                         
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     And what did you tell her about your   
  9   back pain before the incident at Wal-Mart?        
 10        A     I go see her every three months, and   
 11   I -- we don't talk about all that all the time,   
 12   only if I had a situation occur that pertained to 
 13   that area.  She would send me for MRI and then to 
 14   Dr. Charles Parks.                                
 15        Q     How -- why do you see her every three  
 16   months?                                           
 17        A     For my Oxycodone.                      
 18        Q     For what reason do you get Oxycodone?  
 19        A     For the pain that I have.              
 20        Q     In your back?                          
 21        A     In my back.                            
 22        Q     So you go see your primary care        
00136
  1   physician every three months to get a narcotic    
  2   pain prescription for back pain, but are you      
  3   saying you don't talk to your doctor about your   
  4   back pain when you go to get a refill of          
  5   Oxycodone?                                        
  6        A     Yeah.  I see her every three months.   
  7        Q     Right.  But my question was, if you    
  8   see her every three months for Oxycodone          
  9   prescription for back pain --                     
 10        A     Correct.                               
 11        Q     -- is it your testimony that during    
 12   those visits every three months you are not       
 13   talking to her about your back pain?              
 14        A     Correct.  She just does a complete     
 15   work-up.                                          
 16        Q     Every three months?                    
 17        A     Yes.                                   
 18        Q     And gives you Oxycodone?               
 19        A     Yes.                                   
 20        Q     But you don't talk about why you need  
 21   to continue to stay on Oxycodone?                 
 22        A     Because of my pains that I have.       
00137
  1        Q     Has she ever talked to you about       
  2   getting off of the opiate Oxycodone?              
  3        A     No.                                    
  4        Q     And how long have you been taking      
  5   Oxycodone?                                        
  6        A     Since 2011.

  8   how long?                                         
  9        A     I'm thinking around the same time.     
 10        Q     Has any physician ever talked to you   
 11   about getting off of Oxycodone?

 13        Q     Who referred you to Kindred, I think   
 14   it's, at Home care?                               
 15        A     The hospital.

 21        Q     For how long?                          
 22        A     The end of August.

  9   other than physical therapy?                      
 10        A     They did my vitals.  A nurse came out  
 11   as well as physical therapy.                      
 12        Q     And what did the nurse do for you?     
 13        A     She did vitals and checked my surgical

 19   uneventful?  You recovered from surgery as        
 20   expected, or did you have any complications?      
 21        A     I had complications.

  5   use of your left leg?                             
  6        A     When I woke up in the hospital.        
  7        Q     And for how long do you feel you did   
  8   not have use of your left leg?                    
  9        A     It was --                              
 10        Q     Months, weeks, days?                   
 11        A     It was months.                         
 12        Q     You could not walk at all?             
 13        A     With a walker.                         
 14        Q     Okay.  And did Dr. Park tell you why   
 15   you couldn't use your left leg for months?        
 16        A     He just told me it was something that  
 17   happens and it would eventually come back.        
 18        Q     So he said it was like a side effect   
 19   of the surgery?                                   
 20        A     I guess.                               
 21        Q     And did it come back on its own?       
 22        A     Yes.

  1        Q     How long did you use a walker?         
  2        A     Two and a half months, maybe three.    
  3        Q     So until about October?

  5        Q     And you haven't needed any walking aid 
  6   since October of 2018 to current?                 
  7        A     Well, after I went from the walker, I  
  8   used a cane.                                      
  9        Q     How long did you use a cane?           
 10        A     About another four weeks.              
 11        Q     Until November?                        
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And then since November, you haven't   
 14   used any walking aid?                             
 15        A     No, ma'am.                             
 16        Q     Do you need any walking aid now as we  
 17   sit here in September of 2019?                    
 18        A     No, ma'am.                             
 19        Q     So have we generally discussed your    
 20   course of treatment from the claimed injuries at  
 21   Wal-Mart?                                         
 22        A     Yes.                                   
00141
  1        Q     You were ultimately discharged from    
  2   treatment in December of 2018 by Dr. Park; is     
  3   that right?                                       
  4        A     Correct.                               
  5        Q     And is his instruction something like  
  6   call me if you need me, or did he just say you're 
  7   discharged, good luck?                            
  8        A     Just said you're discharged, yes.      
  9        Q     Where do you fill your prescriptions   
 10   other than Wal-Mart?                              
 11        A     My Oxycodone I fill at the CVS.        
 12        Q     Why do you fill that at CVS versus     
 13   Wal-Mart?                                         
 14        A     Because it's cheaper.                  
 15        Q     Which CVS?

 17        Q     Waterloo Road?                         
 18        A     Old Waterloo.  It's the Old Waterloo.  
 19        Q     And for how many years -- since 2011   
 20   is that where you've been filling it?             
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     Any other pharmacies that you fill

  2        A     No.                                    
  3        Q     Your attorney told me this morning     
  4   that you are essentially back to the baseline --  
  5   as we sit here today, you are back essentially to 
  6   the baseline of where you were before the         
  7   incident at Wal-Mart with maybe some exception;   
  8   is that correct?                                  
  9        A     Correct.

 14        Q     Anything else?                         
 15        A     I can't get in and out of my tub       
 16   without having to hold onto the gripping to get   
 17   in and help myself in and out of the tub.         
 18        Q     Anything else?                         
 19        A     I can't do a lot of activities I used  
 20   to do.                                            
 21        Q     Like what?

00143

  5        A     I don't recall.                        
  6        Q     Okay.  You've been disabled and unable

 14        A     Well, my husband plays in a country    
 15   band, and some of the places he goes, my daughter 
 16   will meet us there or my sister and -- I can do

 18        Q     Okay.  I'm trying to get an            
 19   understanding of when was the last time -- is it  
 20   country line dancing?                             
 21        A     Yes, just -- well, I don't line dance, 
 22   just regular dance.                               
00144

 12        A     Before -- well before the incident     
 13   happened.                                         
 14        Q     But when?  I mean if it was 1990,      
 15   that's different than if it was 2010, to me at    
 16   least.                                            
 17        A     It was before the incident.  2018

 11   They have a Golden Corral bingo, and it's during

 10   rating or a disability rating for any part of     
 11   your body as a result of that claim?              
 12        A     No.                                    
 13        Q     They didn't say -- did they just say   
 14   it was temporary and you were resolved and        
 15   recovered, or you don't know?                     
 16        A     I don't know.                          
 17        Q     And the second -- as it was the first  
 18   workers' compensation claim at Kelly Services, do 
 19   you remember working at Kelly Services?           
 20        A     I did.                                 
 21        Q     And what did you do there?             
 22        A     I worked for Black & Decker.           
00168
  1        Q     Okay.  And you don't remember on June  
  2   24th, 1991, what the work-related injury was      
  3   claimed to be?                                    
  4        A     No.                                    
  5        Q     Had you ever made any other workers'   
  6   compensation claim other than the two we just     
  7   discussed?                                        
  8        A     No.                                    
  9              MR. SANDUL:  Let me just say something 
 10   for the record.  Workers' compensation claims are 
 11   often filed by the employer when they're made     
 12   aware of an injury without the person actually    
 13   knowing that they're doing it.                    
 14              MS. ALEXANDER:  Fair enough.           
 15   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 16        Q     Have you ever complained to an         
 17   employer that you were injured at work other than 
 18   these two?                                        
 19        A     No.                                    
 20        Q     Do you have any documents related to   
 21   either of these two workers' compensation claims? 
 22        A     No.                                    
00169
  1        Q     We're going to talk about your prior   
  2   automobile accidents now, and I'm going to try to 
  3   do this chronologically.                          
  4              Actually, you tell me.  When is the    
  5   first automobile accident that you recall?        
  6        A     July 4th, 1997.                        
  7        Q     And what happened in that accident?    
  8        A     We were rear-ended.                    
  9        Q     Who was driving?                       
 10        A     My boyfriend.                          
 11        Q     What was his name?                     
 12        A     Robert Forsythe.                       
 13        Q     And were you injured?                  
 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15        Q     What was injured?                      
 16        A     My neck.                               
 17        Q     Was it soft tissue injuries or         
 18   something objective?                              
 19        A     I don't understand.                    
 20        Q     Did you have a diagnosis or did you    
 21   just have pain?                                   
 22        A     Yes, diagnosis.                        
00170
  1        Q     What was your diagnosis?               
  2        A     A disk in my neck.                     
  3        Q     Like a disk, what happened to the      
  4   disk?                                             
  5        A     It was --                              
  6        Q     Broken, ruptured?                      
  7        A     Crushed down into a nerve.             
  8        Q     Compressed?                            
  9        A     Yes.                                   
 10        Q     So you had a cervical disk             
 11   compression?                                      
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And what treatment did you need for    
 14   that?                                             
 15        A     It was my first neck surgery.          
 16        Q     Who performed that?                    
 17        A     Oh, my gosh.                           
 18        Q     Because I asked you if you had any     
 19   other surgeries we hadn't talked about, and I     
 20   don't recall talking about a neck surgery.  Maybe 
 21   I'm wrong.                                        
 22              MR. SANDUL:  I think you just asked    
00171
  1   about low back.  It was Sinai Hospital.           
  2   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  3        Q     When did you have neck surgery?        
  4        A     The first one was in '97.              
  5        Q     Because of this car accident?          
  6        A     Correct.                               
  7        Q     And what other times have you had neck 
  8   surgery?                                          
  9        A     2006.                                  
 10        Q     Was that the fusion with Dr. Park?     
 11        A     Yes.                                   
 12        Q     Okay.  Any other neck surgeries?       
 13        A     Three.  Dr. Parks did four.            
 14        Q     Those were -- three of those were      
 15   back?                                             
 16        A     And my neck.                           
 17        Q     Okay.  Hold on.  So Dr. Park has       
 18   operated on you a total of five times; is that    
 19   correct?                                          
 20        A     No.                                    
 21        Q     How many times has Dr. Park operated   
 22   on you?                                           
00172
  1        A     Nine.                                  
  2        Q     He's performed surgery on you nine     
  3   times; is that right?                             
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     So was the first time the disk in      
  6   2000?  I mean take me through then.  Before when  
  7   I said have we talked about all of your           
  8   surgeries, now we've left out like at least four. 
  9   So take me through them, please.                  
 10        A     First one was -- my first surgery was  
 11   not by Dr. Parks but my first neck surgery was    
 12   done in '97 due to a car accident.                
 13        Q     Okay.  What's your next one?           
 14        A     2001 or '2.  That was --               
 15        Q     So approximately 2001 or '2, what      
 16   surgery did you have?                             
 17        A     My lower back.                         
 18        Q     And that was done by Dr. Parks?        
 19        A     Correct.                               
 20        Q     For the bulging disk?                  
 21        A     Correct.                               
 22        Q     Then what's next?                      
00173
  1        A     My -- when I had neck surgery.         
  2        Q     When was that?                         
  3        A     Maybe it was 2006.                     
  4        Q     Well you had surgery in 2003 where you 
  5   let Dr. Park put a rod on your right side,        
  6   correct?  You told me about that already.         
  7        A     Oh, my God.  There are so many.  The   
  8   first one they did where he shaved the disk down, 
  9   that was in 2001 or '2.  Then he put rod --       
 10        Q     So sometime around 2003 he put rods or 
 11   hardware in; is that right?                       
 12        A     Correct.                               
 13        Q     And then when was your next surgery?   
 14        A     My neck surgery --                     
 15        Q     Your next surgery.                     
 16        A     I'm sorry.                             
 17        Q     I'm just trying to chronologically     
 18   find out what Dr. Park has done.                  
 19        A     The next surgery he put the rod in.    
 20   On the following surgery -- I'm confused.  I'm    
 21   confused.                                         
 22              MR. SANDUL:  Why don't you try --      
00174
  1              THE WITNESS:  I don't know which ones  
  2   were which.                                       
  3              MR. SANDUL:  Why don't you try to      
  4   stick to your neck first and do those and then    
  5   the low back.                                     
  6   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  7        Q     I think I have the low back, but I'm   
  8   missing four surgeries because you told me he's   
  9   done nine and I am only -- I'm aware of five      
 10   including from this incident that you're          
 11   claiming.  So I'm missing four other surgeries.   
 12        A     Right.  They were on my neck.          
 13        Q     What were -- what -- were they all in  
 14   the last 10 years or so?                          
 15        A     They were all since 1997.              
 16        Q     So Dr. Park has done five back         
 17   surgeries and four neck surgeries on you?         
 18        A     Yes.                                   
 19        Q     Between 1997 and 2018?                 
 20        A     From 2001.                             
 21        Q     Fair enough.                           
 22        A     Right.                                 
00175
  1        Q     Because that was another -- you've     
  2   actually had another neck surgery, but that was a 
  3   different physician?                              
  4        A     Correct.                               
  5        Q     So Dr. Park has done nine total        
  6   surgeries between your neck and your back from    
  7   2001 to 2018?                                     
  8        A     Yes.                                   
  9        Q     So every other year Dr. Park has       
 10   operated on you?                                  
 11        A     No.                                    
 12        Q     How have I been wrong?                 
 13        A     The first -- he went in -- I would     
 14   have to have my dates.  Two of the surgeries were 
 15   a week apart --                                   
 16        Q     Okay.                                  
 17        A     -- on my neck.                         
 18        Q     I'll withdraw my question.  You're     
 19   right.  That was probably not a fair -- but he's  
 20   done nine surgeries in 18 years -- no, 17 years?  
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     From 2001 to 2018?                     
00176
  1        A     Yes.                                   
  2        Q     Plus you had another doctor who did a  
  3   neck surgery in '97?                              
  4        A     Correct.                               
  5        Q     You've had at least one elbow surgery? 
  6        A     Correct.                               
  7        Q     And you've had two right hand wrist    
  8   surgeries?                                        
  9        A     Correct.                               
 10        Q     Are there any other -- other than the  
 11   hysterectomy and the lung surgery, any other      
 12   surgeries?                                        
 13        A     No.                                    
 14        Q     Okay.  So we're talking about the car  
 15   accident -- is there something else?              
 16        A     No.                                    
 17              MR. SANDUL:  Before you get there,     
 18   just my -- the one I listed as Number 3, that     
 19   should be '08.  It was a typo.                    
 20              MS. ALEXANDER:  What, are you on       
 21   supplemental?

  2        A     Glen Burnie.                           
  3        Q     And what happened?                     
  4        A     We're going to my father's, and we     
  5   were sitting on that road to make a left on 648.  
  6        Q     Who was driving?                       
  7        A     My husband.  And a vehicle come        
  8   pulling up beside us and whipped a drink into the 
  9   side of my head.                                  
 10        Q     You mean your window was down and they 
 11   threw a drink at you?                             
 12        A     Yes.  And then when we went to go to   
 13   get like where -- they were behind us and they    
 14   come pulling up behind us and came up beside of   
 15   us and threw a drink at my face.                  
 16        Q     Are you saying that happened twice or  
 17   you're just telling me the same thing?            
 18        A     Yeah.                                  
 19        Q     So they threw a drink.  And what       
 20   happened?                                         
 21        A     And we went to go, and they pulled in  
 22   front of us.  And my husband clipped the right    
00187
  1   back bumper of his.  And then after all that, we  
  2   called police, and I went to the commissioner's   
  3   office.  And it came out in court -- they gave me 
  4   my protective order.  And then when we went for   
  5   trial, he had to do classes and whatnot, the      
  6   gentleman did.                                    
  7        Q     Okay.  Were you injured in that claim? 
  8        A     No.                                    
  9        Q     Because I have in the answers that I   
 10   got that there was an automobile accident on      
 11   March 16, 2017.  Is that this?                    
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     Because the answers you gave me said a 
 14   claim was filed and the case was settled and you  
 15   had neck and shoulder pain for the March 16,      
 16   2017.  I'm looking at your supplemental answer to 
 17   Interrogatory Number 12, which is in Exhibit 3.   
 18   So does that help refresh your recollection that  
 19   you had neck and shoulder pain from that          
 20   incident?                                         
 21        A     I don't recall.                        
 22        Q     Does it help refresh your recollection 
00188
  1   that you filed a claim and you settled that case? 
  2   If you don't remember, just say you don't         
  3   remember.                                         
  4        A     I don't remember.                      
  5        Q     What was your next automobile          
  6   accident?                                         
  7        A     That was the last one.                 
  8        Q     But what was that one?  I don't know   
  9   what the last one means?                          
 10        A     That was --                            
 11        Q     Oh, March 16, 2017, was your last      
 12   accident?                                         
 13        A     Yes.                                   
 14        Q     Motor vehicle accident?                
 15        A     Yes.                                   
 16        Q     So we've had five previous motor       
 17   vehicle accidents; is that correct?               
 18        A     Yes.                                   
 19        Q     We're going to go through your         
 20   previous slip, trip, and fall cases now.          
 21        A     Okay.                                  
 22        Q     When was your first slip or trip and   
00189
  1   fall case?                                        
  2        A     I don't recall.                        
  3        Q     I have that you had one -- the first   
  4   one I have is in 2005.  Does that sound right?    
  5   I'm just going off the answers you provided,      
  6   ma'am, from your medical records.                 
  7              Do you remember the incident, the      
  8   slip, trip, and fall from June 30th, 2005?        
  9        A     I don't recall.                        
 10        Q     But if your medical records reflect    
 11   that you were treated at Harbor Hospital          
 12   complaining of right ankle, low back, and right   
 13   hip pain, you wouldn't have any reason to doubt   
 14   your medical records, correct?                    
 15        A     Correct.                               
 16        Q     But you don't have any independent     
 17   memory of that or where it occurred?              
 18        A     Correct.                               
 19        Q     Or whether you filed a claim?          
 20        A     Correct.                               
 21        Q     Okay.  The next one I have is in       
 22   2008 -- well, let me ask you this.                
00190
  1              What is the first slip, trip, or fall  
  2   that you remember?                                
  3        A     Tripping over the carpet.              
  4        Q     Where?                                 
  5        A     At Midas.                              
  6        Q     When was that?                         
  7        A     I don't recall the exact time.         
  8              MR. SANDUL:  That was --               
  9   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 10        Q     So if I told you it was 2008, would    
 11   that ring true to you in your timeline?           
 12        A     Yes.                                   
 13        Q     And tell me what happened.             
 14        A     I was walking in to get my car         
 15   serviced.  And when I walked in, the corner of    
 16   the rug was up, and I stepped in, and I tripped   
 17   over that.                                        
 18        Q     Did you fall?                          
 19        A     Yes.                                   
 20        Q     To the ground?                         
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     And were you injured?                  
00191
  1        A     My ankle.                              
  2        Q     Which ankle?                           
  3        A     My right ankle.                        
  4        Q     I have that you claimed injury to your 
  5   right hip, your right ankle, your right knee, and 
  6   your low back; is that correct?                   
  7        A     Yes.                                   
  8        Q     And where did you get treatment?       
  9        A     I don't recall.                        
 10        Q     Did you hire a lawyer?                 
 11        A     I don't remember if I did with that.   
 12        Q     I have that you settled that case.  Do 
 13   you remember getting money from that case too?    
 14        A     No.                                    
 15        Q     You don't remember --                  
 16        A     I don't recall.                        
 17        Q     -- a lawsuit?  If you don't, it's      
 18   fine.  You just tell me you don't remember.       
 19        A     I don't remember that.                 
 20        Q     What is the next slip, trip, and fall  
 21   that you remember?                                
 22        A     Charlie Ward's.                        
00192
  1        Q     When was that?                         
  2        A     That was in 2010.                      
  3        Q     And that's the one we talked about     
  4   where you made the claim for slipping but not     
  5   falling in the kitchen?                           
  6        A     Correct.                               
  7        Q     What was the next one?                 
  8        A     Wal-Mart.                              
  9        Q     I have that there was one in 2011      
 10   where you claimed a back injury after a fall on   
 11   July 6, 2011.  Do you remember that?              
 12        A     That was Charlie Ward's.               
 13        Q     No.  You were treated at Baltimore     
 14   Washington Medical Center.  Do you have any       
 15   independent recollection of that?                 
 16        A     No.                                    
 17        Q     So if your medical records documented  
 18   what you claimed in that incident, I believe,     
 19   that you claimed back injury, that your medical   
 20   records would be correct, whatever it is that     
 21   they say?                                         
 22        A     Yes.

  2   general one.                                      
  3   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  4        Q     You wouldn't have any reason to doubt  
  5   the content of your medical records from that     
  6   incident?                                         
  7        A     Correct.                               
  8        Q     I also have that you claimed a slip    
  9   and fall on June 3rd, 2016.  Do you remember

 11        A     No.                                    
 12        Q     Claim that you slipped on water.  Do   
 13   you have any recollection of that?  You were      
 14   treated -- you went to see Dr. Park.              
 15              MR. SANDUL:  June 3rd of '16?          
 16              MS. ALEXANDER:  Mm-hmm.  Do you see    
 17   it?                                               
 18              MR. SANDUL:  I don't have one.         
 19              MS. ALEXANDER:  You gave it to me.     
 20              MR. SANDUL:  I think that may be --    
 21   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 22        Q     Well, there was some specifics in your 
00194
  1   record about slipping on water.  Whatever that -- 
  2   whatever your -- do you have any reason to doubt  
  3   the content of your medical records?              
  4        A     No.                                    
  5        Q     Okay.  Have you slipped or tripped on  
  6   anything since the incident at Wal-Mart?          
  7        A     No.                                    
  8        Q     Have you -- are there any other        
  9   lawsuits that -- other than your two divorces --  
 10   that you filed that we haven't discussed?         
 11        A     No.                                    
 12        Q     Are there any other claims where you   
 13   claim you've been injured at the fault of someone 
 14   else that we haven't discussed?                   
 15        A     No.                                    
 16        Q     Now, I understand that you allege that 
 17   you fell after your July 2018 surgery four times  
 18   after that; is that right?                        
 19        A     Yes.                                   
 20        Q     What caused you to fall four times     
 21   between July and August of 2018?                  
 22        A     First time I fell was after I come     
00195
  1   home from the hospital.                           
  2        Q     Okay.  You can just tell me what       
  3   happened.                                         
  4        A     I had no use of my left leg.  If I     
  5   walked, I had to stiffen the knee before I could  
  6   take a step.  I have to move my leg forward,      
  7   stiffen the knee and back.  I went to go around   
  8   my bed, and my knee didn't stiffen or holdup and  
  9   down I went onto my knees.                        
 10        Q     Okay.                                  
 11        A     That was between my bed and my         
 12   dresser.                                          
 13        Q     Were you injured?                      
 14        A     No.                                    
 15        Q     What was the next time you fell?       
 16        A     My living room, I was going in between 
 17   my coffee table and my sofa, and again my leg     
 18   went out on me.                                   
 19        Q     Were you injured?                      
 20        A     No.                                    
 21        Q     What was the next time you fell?       
 22        A     In my kitchen.  I went to turn around. 
00196
  1   One of my kittens started crying and instinct I   
  2   just turned around, not thinking, and I went down 
  3   to the floor.                                     
  4        Q     Were you injured?                      
  5        A     No.                                    
  6        Q     And when was the next time?            
  7        A     Was August the 17th.                   
  8        Q     Of 2018?                               
  9        A     Correct.  And I had -- I was standing  
 10   and holding -- we were getting ready to go to my  
 11   mother's for our anniversary since we couldn't go 
 12   to Carolina like we had planned.  I came back     
 13   from getting my nails done.  I held onto my       
 14   recliner.  I put down -- lifted my leg to pull my 
 15   toe separators out.  When I stood back up, I just 
 16   blacked out and went straight back.               
 17        Q     Okay.  Were you injured?               
 18        A     Yes.                                   
 19        Q     What was your injury?

 21        Q     Were you treated?                      
 22        A     I went to an urgent clinic in          
00197

  5        Q     What was the name of that facility?    
  6        A     I don't recall the name of that.       
  7        Q     Do you have any documents at home from 
  8   that?

 13        Q     -- and then he'll provide them to me.  
 14        A     Yes.                                   
 15        Q     The only surgery that you're claiming  
 16   -- and feel free to answer this counsel -- that's 
 17   related to the incident at Wal-Mart is the back   
 18   surgery?                                          
 19              MR. SANDUL:  Correct.                  
 20              MS. ALEXANDER:  You're not claiming    
 21   the right wrist surgery you had this year is

 16        A     No.                                    
 17        Q     What is your name on Facebook?         
 18        A     Mary Murphy.                           
 19        Q     Are you identified by any other way or 
 20   are you just saying you're identified by Mary     
 21   Murphy?                                           
 22        A     That's all.                            
00199
  1        Q     Do you use Twitter or Instagram?

 11        Q     So you last went on a trip in 2014?

 20   mother's in Pennsylvania?                         
 21        A     Yes.                                   
 22        Q     And you go there pretty frequently?    
00200
  1        A     Yes.                                   
  2        Q     How often?  A couple times a month?    
  3        A     Oh, yes.                               
  4        Q     You drive there, it sounds like, with  
  5   your husband?                                     
  6        A     Yes.                                   
  7        Q     Since the incident at Wal-Mart, you    
  8   still drive up and see your mom?                  
  9        A     Yes.                                   
 10        Q     Okay.  And you go how many times a     
 11   month on average since -- for the past year?      
 12        A     That just depends.                     
 13        Q     Okay.  But on average are you seeing   
 14   her at least once or twice a month?               
 15        A     Yes.                                   
 16        Q     And you go to her?  She doesn't come

 18        A     Yes.                                   
 19        Q     Has any medical health care provider   
 20   told you that the injuries you're claiming from   
 21   Wal-Mart are permanent?                           
 22        A     No.                                    
00201
  1        Q     So you're not claiming permanency?     
  2              MR. SANDUL:  They are permanent, but   
  3   we're not claiming she's going to have any future 
  4   surgery or anything.  That's always subject to    
  5   change, but I don't see it changing.  If it comes 
  6   up and a doctor says it's related.  But not at    
  7   the present.                                      
  8   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
  9        Q     So what are you claiming is permanent  
 10   or are you?                                       
 11              MR. SANDUL:  What she previously told  
 12   you, the limitations, the increased limitations.  
 13              MS. ALEXANDER:  That's a fair point.   
 14   BY MS. ALEXANDER:                                 
 15        Q     Physically is there any permanent      
 16   injury to your body other than the limitations    
 17   you've told us about?  Like do you have a         
 18   permanent -- I don't want to plant ideas in your  
 19   head.  Do you have a permanent limp or permanent  
 20   twitch or anything like that?                     
 21        A     Well, I can't walk too quick any more. 
 22        Q     Okay.                                  
00202
  1        A     And my up and down steps is kind of -- 
  2        Q     You go slower?                         
  3        A     Yeah.                                  
  4        Q     Anything else?                         
  5        A     I have to told on to my husband.  Like 
  6   going up my mom's hill, I can't go up and down    
  7   her hill any more.                                
  8        Q     Are you saying that's from the         
  9   incident at Wal-Mart, or did you have that from   
 10   your prior eight back and neck surgeries?         
 11        A     No.  That's from this last.            
 12        Q     So you never made that claim before in 
 13   your five prior car accidents or your prior slip  
 14   and falls or your eight prior back or neck        
 15   surgeries that you had to hold your husband for   
 16   help or go slow walking or take your time going   
 17   upstairs?  That's all because of this incident at 
 18   Wal-Mart?                                         
 19        A     Correct.                               
 20        Q     Okay.  Anything else?                  
 21        A     Not that I can recall.                 
 22        Q     I think those are all -- well, -- so   
00203
  1   close.                                            
  2              Are you still taking the Oxycodone and 
  3   the Gabapentin now like you were at the time --   
  4   same dosage and frequency?                        
  5        A     Correct.                               
  6        Q     Okay.  So your pain level now, is it   
  7   back to where it was before the incident at       
  8   Wal-Mart?  I know that's a hard question because  
  9   you take pain medication.                         
 10              But is your pain level now the same as 
 11   it was before the incident at Wal-Mart?           
 12        A     No.                                    
 13        Q     How is it different?                   
 14        A     It's more intense.                     
 15        Q     How so?                                
 16        A     The weather -- the change in the       
 17   weather and the rain and stuff like that, I hurt  
 18   real bad.                                         
 19        Q     And how is that different from your    
 20   chronic back pain and multiple back and neck      
 21   surgeries before 2018?                            
 22        A     Well, I always ached.  I always had    
00204
  1   the aching part and the sore part, but the pain   
  2   level has increased since this last time.         
  3        Q     Have you told your doctors that?       
  4        A     Yes.                                   
  5        Q     And have they increased your dosage of 
  6   your narcotic pain medication?                    
  7        A     No.                                    
  8        Q     Or have they increased your dosage of  
  9   any of your medication?                           
 10        A     No.                                    
 11        Q     Anything else?                         
 12        A     No.                                    
 13              MS. ALEXANDER:  Okay.  I think those   
 14   are all my questions.                             
 15              MR. SANDUL:  I just have one question. 
 16   I didn't see -- you said in our answers to        
 17   Interrogatories you listed a fall June 3rd of     
 18   '16?                                              
 19              MS. ALEXANDER:  Let me take a look.    
 20              MR. SANDUL:  I think I know where      
 21   you're getting that from, but it's not our        
 22   answers.                                          
00205
  1              MS. ALEXANDER:  Right here.  I'm       
  2   looking at -- we can go off the record.  You okay 
  3   going off the record?                             
  4              MR. SANDUL:  Let's stay on.            
  5              MS. ALEXANDER:  I'm looking at Exhibit 
  6   3 which are the Supplemental Answers to           
  7   Interrogatories I got last night.                 
  8              MR. SANDUL:  Okay.                     
  9              MS. ALEXANDER:  And they're not        
 10   paginated, so I can't tell you what page, but I   
 11   can show you right here.  The June 27, 2016, Dr.  
 12   Charles Park, status post slip and fall on June   
 13   3rd, 2016.                                        
 14              MR. SANDUL:  That's because he put     
 15   that date down.  It was incorrect.  I'm sorry.  I 
 16   did not see that.                                 
 17              MS. ALEXANDER:  No problem.  Any --    
 18              MR. SANDUL:  No, because I didn't have 
 19   it listed on the other side.  That's what Park    
 20   put down as the date.

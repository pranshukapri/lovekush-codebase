      14   BY MR. BLUM:

      15        Q    Could you state your full name for

      16   the record, please?

      17        A    James Farr, F-A-R-R.

      18        Q    Mr. Farr, my name is Joseph Blum and

      19   I represent Mercedes-Benz in a case that's

      20   been brought by Capitol Indemnity Insurance.

      21   I'm going to ask you a series of questions

      22   today about what you might know about that

      23   incident or the aftermath of that incident.

      24   If at any time you don't understand my


                                                         7




       1   question, please let me know, I'll be happy to

       2   restate it for you.  And I would ask that you

       3   keep all of your responses verbal because the

       4   court reporter cannot take down nods of our

       5   heads or shrugs of our shoulders.  Okay?

       6        A    Okay.

       7        Q    I would also ask you to try to let

       8   me finish stating my question before you start

       9   to speak so that the court reporter also can

      10   take us each down separately.  Okay?

      11        A    Yes.

      12        Q    Could you tell us by whom you're

      13   employed?

      14        A    The Johns Eastern Company.

      15        Q    And what does Johns Eastern Company

      16   do?

      17        A    We are an independent insurance

      18   adjusting firm.

      19        Q    Okay.  And do you do work for

      20   insureds or for the insurance industry or

      21   both?

      22        A    The insurance industry.

      23        Q    Okay.  And how long have you worked

      24   there?


                                                         8




       1        A    15-1/2 years.

       2        Q    And what do you do there?

       3        A    Currently I'm a field adjuster

       4   supervisor.

       5        Q    Okay.  And how long have you been in

       6   that position?

       7        A    Six to seven years.

       8        Q    Okay.  And tell me, what does that

       9   mean?

      10        A    As opposed to going into the field

      11   any longer, I supervise those who do go into

      12   the field and review their product before

      13   being released to the insurance carriers and

      14   clients.

      15        Q    All right.  And do you do any

      16   adjusting at all yourself at this point or --

      17        A    Minimal.

      18        Q    Okay.  And are there certain types

      19   of claims that you handle personally?

      20        A    Not at this point.

      21        Q    Okay.

      22        A    I mean, on occasion I still do go

      23   out.  But usually it's because volume is up or

      24   staffing is low.


                                                         9




       1        Q    Okay.  And before you became the

       2   supervisor, what were you doing?

       3        A    Field adjusting.

       4        Q    And is this all property damage

       5   claims?

       6        A    No.

       7        Q    So tell me the varieties, the types

       8   of claims that you would be working on?

       9        A    We do first-party property,

      10   third-party property, which is what I

      11   supervise at this point, but I'm also trained

      12   and experienced with casualty, slip and falls,

      13   trip and falls, both commercial and homeowner.

      14        Q    And before you went to your current

      15   employer, who did you work for?

      16        A    Allstate Insurance.

      17        Q    How long did you work at Allstate?

      18        A    About four years.

      19        Q    And what did you do there?

      20        A    Auto adjuster, auto -- yeah, auto

      21   adjuster.

      22        Q    And before Allstate where did you

      23   work?

      24        A    Grotto Pizza.


                                                        10




       1        Q    Okay.  And was that something you

       2   did while you were in school or right out of

       3   school?

       4        A    Since I was 15 until I married my

       5   wife and couldn't get her a job up there.

       6        Q    Okay.  And tell us what your

       7   educational background is?

       8        A    I have a Bachelor of Arts degree,

       9   major in criminal justice from Lycoming

      10   College, Williamsport.

      11        Q    And what year did you get that

      12   degree?

      13        A    '98.

      14        Q    And while you were at Allstate, did

      15   you receive any type of formal training there?

      16        A    Yeah.

      17        Q    And just tell us basically what kind

      18   of training you received from them?

      19        A    Sent me to Chicago to a training

      20   center that they had out there at their home

      21   office that included claim setup, initial

      22   contact, and just liability investigations,

      23   auto liability investigations.

      24        Q    All right.  And when you went to


                                                        11




       1   Johns Eastern, have you received any formal

       2   training there?

       3        A    Formal, not through Johns Eastern.

       4        Q    Through any other source?

       5        A    I am half a course shy of my AIC

       6   exam through The Institutes.  Other than that,

       7   that's --

       8        Q    What would that stand for?

       9        A    Associate in claims.

      10        Q    And is that something you are

      11   continuing to work towards?

      12        A    Yes.  My final exam is next week,

      13   two weeks.

      14        Q    Okay.  And do you have to go

      15   somewhere to take those courses or is it

      16   online?

      17        A    I study online.  And then a course

      18   is taken or the test is taken at PerlMetrics.

      19        Q    And any other training that you

      20   received since you've been at Johns Eastern?

      21        A    We just finished up a training

      22   seminar for independent appraisals and

      23   independent umpires.  I have been trained with

      24   NFIP flood insurance, my license has lapsed

       1   though, because we just don't have the

       2   opportunity.

       3             I have my Delaware license for

       4   adjustment along with reciprocating licenses

       5   for most of New England, Maine, New Hampshire,

       6   Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts

       7   doesn't require one.  And I do not license in

       8   New York.

       9        Q    How about Pennsylvania, do they

      10   require one?

      11        A    They do not.

      12        Q    At some point was your company

      13   assigned a loss that occurred at S-Bond

      14   Technologies in Lansdale?

      15        A    Yes.

      16        Q    Okay.  Can you tell me what your

      17   personal involvement was with that claim?

      18        A    I was the assigned field adjuster to

      19   adjust for business personal property loss.

      20        Q    And did you have anything to do with

      21   any type of what I'll call business

      22   interruption or extra expense claims?

      23        A    Minimal.

      24        Q    Okay.


                                                        13




       1        A    It was forwarded on to someone else.

       2        Q    And what was your minimal

       3   involvement with that?

       4        A    Early on before it got separated

       5   out, I collected information to set up a new

       6   office, such as installation of new phone

       7   systems, security systems, IT department for a

       8   new location.  Had our IT supervisor review

       9   some of the documents for additional loss

      10   expense.

      11        Q    Okay.

      12        A    But then it was eventually moved on

      13   to someone when it came into business income

      14   loss as well.

      15        Q    Okay.  And did you personally, when

      16   this assignment came in, go out to the

      17   premises?

      18        A    I did.

      19        Q    And who, if anyone, did you meet

      20   there?

      21        A    I remember Ron Smith was there.  I

      22   do not recall anyone else's name.

      23        Q    And is it accurate that you were

      24   there acting on behalf of Capitol Indemnity


                                                        14




       1   Insurance?

       2        A    I believe we referred to them as

       3   Capitol Specialty, but yes.

       4        Q    And what was the assignment, like

       5   what officially did they ask you to do?

       6        A    I don't recall, so I apologize.  But

       7   for the most part I would probably say they,

       8   "Here's an assignment, please go out and

       9   review and report.  And we'll go from there as

      10   to what we need next."

      11             It's usually, "Let's set a reserve,

      12   let's find a cause of loss, if determinable,

      13   and then appraise damages."

      14        Q    Okay.  And what, if anything, did

      15   you do to prepare for your deposition today?

      16        A    I tried to review my file as best as

      17   possible.

      18        Q    And tell me your files, are they

      19   maintained in paper or electronic?

      20        A    Electronic.

      21        Q    Is it something that's maintained on

      22   a server in your office or elsewhere?

      23        A    Online.

      24        Q    Okay.  And tell me, how is that file


                                                        15




       1   organized on your computer system, what does

       2   it look like?

       3        A    Per file, so you search per our

       4   individual file numbers, and then when it's

       5   opened up, individual documents are titled in

       6   a list.  And then we can open up individual

       7   documents for review of said document.

       8        Q    All right.  So it's not like when

       9   you open it up, there's subfolders that have

      10   different categories or anything like that?

      11        A    I would not call them subfolders,

      12   no.  It's one, here is all the documents for

      13   your file in a list, but then you have to

      14   choose which one you actually want to view.

      15        Q    Okay.

      16        A    You have to make sure they're titled

      17   properly.

      18        Q    And other than reviewing your file,

      19   did you do anything else other than speak to

      20   Gus?

      21        A    No.

      22        Q    Was there anybody at Capitol

      23   Indemnity that you reached out to about you

      24   being asked to be here for a deposition?


                                                        16




       1        A    Just to provide knowledge to Paul

       2   Petrovich.

       3        Q    Have you had an opportunity to

       4   review any of the deposition transcripts for

       5   anyone who has been deposed here in this case?

       6        A    No.

       7        Q    You mentioned that one of the things

       8   that you were asked to do was determine the

       9   cause of the loss.  Did you do that in this

      10   case?

      11        A    I did not.

      12        Q    Why not?

      13        A    It was too large of a loss, too

      14   complicated, so an outside vendor was retained

      15   to finish that portion of it off.

      16        Q    All right.  And do you know who that

      17   was?

      18        A    I apologize, I do not recall.

      19        Q    Okay.  Not a problem.

      20             And did you ever ask Mr. -- is it

      21   Ron Smith?

      22        A    Yes, the named insured owner of

      23   S-Bond.

      24        Q    And did you ever ask him if he had


                                                        17




       1   any knowledge of how the fire started?

       2        A    I believe, if I recall, during our

       3   initial inspection, it had started in a

       4   neighboring unit of the building, and there

       5   was rumors and speculation that it may have

       6   been one of the vehicles parked inside the

       7   building.

       8        Q    And did you do anything to verify

       9   any of those rumors or speculation?

      10        A    No.  It was turned over to whoever

      11   the cause and origin investigator was.

      12        Q    And do you know what was the first

      13   day that you went out there to investigate

      14   this loss?

      15        A    I would have to check my notes.

      16        Q    Okay.  Why don't we stop for a

      17   minute then.

      21   BY MR. BLUM:

      22        Q    Mr. Farr, you were kind enough to

      23   bring with you portions of your file.  Can you

      24   tell us, is there any portion of your file


                                                        18




       1   that you did not bring with you?

       2        A    Yes.

       3        Q    Okay.  And what is it you did not

       4   bring?

       5        A    Reports, the specific interim

       6   reports.  And various email exchanges between

       7   the insured and myself, between myself and Cap

       8   Specialty.

       9                  MR. SARA:  Which I believe were

      10        produced in some fashion.

      11                  MR. BLUM:  I'm just trying to

      12        figure out what I have and don't have.

      13                  MR. SARA:  You have it all in

      14        some fashion.

      15                  THE WITNESS:  What I brought

      16        was my adjustment and supports for said

      17        adjustments.

      18                  MR. BLUM:  Okay, perfect.

      19                  We are going to mark, if we

      20        could, as Exhibit 1 a portion of your

      21        file, and ask you if you could first

      22        identify for us what that is.

       5        my initial inspection.

       6   BY MR. BLUM:

       7        Q    Okay.  And is this all of the

       8   photographs you took during your initial

       9   inspection?

      10        A    I want to say no.

      11        Q    Okay.

      12        A    But they are the ones that I

      13   utilized.

      14        Q    Okay.  And in what manner did you

      15   utilize them?

      16        A    Ones I wouldn't use would be the

      17   duplicate photographs that would have shown

      18   the same thing, a photograph that would not

      19   have come out clearly.  It just would have

      20   been not included in my photo report.

      21        Q    Okay.  And in this, as you called

      22   it, photo report, does this, as far as you're

      23   concerned, document all of the items on which

      24   the insured made a claim?

       2        it is supposed to be in there, but it

       3        looks like it just -- off the record.

      13                       - --

      14                  THE WITNESS:  It is my effort,

      15        it was my effort to document all of the

      16        items that the insured made a claim for.

      17        There are several overview shots of

      18        items.  Did I take photographs of each

      19        individual specific items?  No.  But in a

      20        overview shot they were located during

      21        submission of lists from the insured.

      22   BY MR. BLUM:

      23        Q    Okay.  The very first page appears

      24   to be a cover page.  Is that basically

       1   providing just all the background information

       2   about who contacts were and everything?

       3        A    Exactly.  It's just a setup.

       4        Q    At the bottom of this it says, "Date

       5   inspected:  6/17/2016."  Is that the day you

       6   recall being there?

       7        A    That would be accurate, yes.

       8        Q    Okay.  Can you tell us on June 17th

       9   when you went there what you did?

      10        A    It was an informal interview with

      11   the insured, walk-through of the property,

      12   walk-around of the property, photographs, and

      13   note-taking.

      14        Q    Okay.  And when you say note-taking,

      15   can you tell us what kind of notes you took?

      16        A    Handwritten notes of our

      17   conversation for memoriam.

      18        Q    And did you keep those handwritten

      19   notes?

      20        A    I don't recall at this point.

      21        Q    Okay.  I'm going to show you some

      22   documents which you provided, which I believe

      23   are inventories which came from the client.

      24                  MR. BLUM:  We'll mark this as

      10        A    Exhibit 2 appears to be the second

      11   business personal property inventory list

      12   provided by the insured, along with copies of

      13   his purchase receipts for replacement of those

      14   items that were damaged in the loss.

      15        Q    Okay.  Let me see if I can -- is

      16   this one the first?

      17        A    It is not.

      18        Q    Okay.

      19                  MR. SARA:  Maybe that one, the

      20        thinner one --

      21                  THE WITNESS:  That one.

      22                  MR. BLUM:  Let's mark this as

       6        Q    All right.  Mr. Farr, showing you

       7   Exhibit No. 3, is this the first inventory

       8   that's a document that came from S-Bond?

       9        A    This looks like the first list, yes.

      10        Q    And when you received this first

      11   list, what, if anything, did you do with it?

      12        A    Reviewed it and requested additional

      13   information for it.

      14        Q    Okay.  So let's just take one of the

      15   items, like at the very top it says "Honeywell

      16   Portable Air Cooler."  Is all the information

      17   that appears for that unit there information

      18   that was put in by the insured?

      19        A    I believe, yes, it is.

      20        Q    Okay.  And tell me, what was your

      21   understanding of the difference between the

      22   replacement cost estimate and the cost

      23   columns?

      24        A    Replacement cost would be what it


                                                        24




       1   cost him to replace it today versus what he

       2   purchased it for.

       3        Q    Okay.  So the replacement cost

       4   estimate is what you think he paid for it

       5   originally and then the cost is what he -- or

       6   just the opposite?

       7        A    Opposite.

       8        Q    Okay.  And when you went through

       9   this list, did you approve these items for

      10   payment by the insurance company?

      11        A    I eventually did approve them, yes.

      12        Q    Okay.  And which number did you

      13   approve?

      14        A    If I were to guess, I would have to

      15   check my report number 8 list there, but I

      16   would say it was the $19,972.69.

      17        Q    And then is it accurate that the

      18   insured was reimbursed for the replacement

      19   cost versus the actual cash value on these

      20   items?

      21        A    Although I did not issue the check,

      22   that would be my presumption.

      23        Q    Okay.  Let me ask you this.  Did you

      24   personally or anyone on your behalf make an


                                                        25




       1   attempt to determine the actual cash value on

       2   any of these items?

       3        A    No.

       4        Q    And did you receive backup invoices

       5   from the insured for everything that was

       6   listed on Exhibit No. 3?

       7        A    My guess was it was requested.

       8   However, I was unable to locate it in my file.

       9        Q    Okay.  And when you report to

      10   Capitol Indemnity, does it require you to send

      11   them copies of all the invoices or just your

      12   report?

      13        A    No.  I send them everything.

      14        Q    Okay.  Let's go back now to Exhibit

      15   No. 2, I think, which I already marked, which

      16   I believe you said was the second inventory;

      17   is that correct?

      18        A    I believe it is, yes.

      19        Q    All right.  And again -- I'm sorry,

      20   on this Exhibit No. 2, again, this information

      21   all came from the insured; correct?

      22        A    It did, yes.

      23        Q    And in the column that says "Status"

      24   there is listed RP there.  Did you have an


                                                        26




       1   understanding of what that meant?

       2        A    I believe it was his code for

       3   replaced.

       4        Q    Okay.  And so then is it accurate

       5   that only the things that he replaced he was

       6   paid for?

       7        A    No.

       8        Q    Okay.  So some of the items, for

       9   example, like if you go partway down, there's

      10   a whole bunch of items for Kobalt tools and

      11   tool cabinet.  Are those like a new item?  Can

      12   you tell me why those are listed if they're

      13   not being replaced?

      14        A    Receipt number 23, which shows that

      15   they were replaced.

      16        Q    Okay.  So I'm a little bit confused

      17   about why the RP is there?

      18        A    I didn't fill the form out.

      19        Q    All right.  Again, I know that, so

      20   it's just a question of what your

      21   understanding was?

      22        A    As I talked to him, if I recall, he

      23   told me that RP meant replaced.

      24        Q    Okay.  And again, was it your


                                                        27




       1   understanding that the insured was being

       2   reimbursed for the replacement cost and not

       3   the actual cash value on these items?

       4        A    That was my understanding, yes.

       5        Q    And did you personally undertake,

       6   make any attempt to determine what the actual

       7   cash value was on any of these?

       8        A    No.

       9        Q    And did you personally try to

      10   connect the things that are listed on Exhibit

      11   2 or 3 to the photographs that you had of the

      12   loss?

      13        A    Yes.

      14        Q    And did you verify to your

      15   satisfaction that everything that was on

      16   Exhibit 2 and 3 was actually there at the

      17   property and damaged?

      18        A    Yes.

      19        Q    Let me show you a document which

      20   we'll mark as Exhibit 4.

       2   BY MR. BLUM:

       3        Q    Is Exhibit No. 4 what I'll call the

       4   next group of requests by the insured?

       5        A    Yes.  This would be his third list.

       6        Q    Okay.  And did you personally verify

       7   that all of these items were actually in the

       8   property?

       9        A    Through review of my photographs is

      10   how it was done, yes.

      11        Q    And here on the column that says

      12   "Status," there's one of the items that has CL

      13   next to it.  Do you see that?

      14        A    Uh-huh.

      15        Q    Did you have an understanding of

      16   what the CL stood for?

      17        A    My understanding was cleaned.

      18        Q    Okay.

      19        A    But I don't know the final status.

      20   Receipt would suggest that they were

      21   repurchased again, cleaning did not

      22   sufficiently clean beakers, chemicals,

      23   graduated cylinders.

      24        Q    All right.  And your position would


                                                        29




       1   be if we look for receipt number 66 in the

       2   backup behind this, that would show those

       3   items?

       4        A    Yes, as I recall it should.

       5        Q    All right.  And if you in fact turn

       6   to -- they're numbered at the top, is that

       7   correct, the invoices?

       8        A    Yeah.

       9        Q    All right.  And this is the

      10   replacement cost for those beakers?

      11        A    It's what I was told.

      12        Q    Okay.  It doesn't appear that the

      13   math actually adds up, though, does it?

      14        A    U/S cleaner supplies.  It looks like

      15   Line 1 of that estimate would have been

      16   subtracted out of the total to provide the

      17   final total of the $58.86.

      18        Q    And in fact if you look at that, are

      19   in fact those -- they're not replacement

      20   items, they're actually items to clean?

      21        A    Which is what his list says, U/S

      22   cleaner supplies, and then I would have to

      23   assume that glass beakers, chemicals,

      24   graduated cylinders is what he was cleaning.


                                                        30




       1        Q    Okay.  And as far as you know, the

       2   insured was reimbursed for the total that

       3   appears here?

       4        A    I believe he was.

       5        Q    Okay.  And there is an item on this

       6   particular list for demolition and excavation

       7   at the old address.  Do you see that?

       8        A    I do.

       9        Q    And was the insured responsible for

      10   some form of demo at the property?

      11        A    A portion of it.

      12        Q    And what were they responsible for?

      13        A    My guess is the invoice that has yet

      14   to be reviewed yet.

      15        Q    Okay.

      16                  MR. BLUM:  We'll mark this as

      17        Exhibit 5.

      22   BY MR. BLUM:

      23        Q    I'm showing you Exhibit 5, and it

      24   looks to me that there's actually two --


                                                        31




       1   several things that are combined here.  Why

       2   don't you go through and tell us what each of

       3   these items is?

       4        A    The first one was the demolition bid

       5   of his portion of the total billing

       6   demolition.

       7        Q    Okay.

       8        A    He left several items inside of it

       9   that needed to be carted away.

      10        Q    Okay.

      11        A    And that was his portion of the

      12   total demo from Knechel.

      13             The second one, EDS, is a packout of

      14   salvageable items and storage at an offsite

      15   facility.

      16        Q    Okay.

      17        A    And the third one is their final

      18   invoice, I believe.  The $1,570 would be their

      19   final invoice for moving van back to a new

      20   location.

      21             Next one would be a Power ER invoice

      22   for the computers, replacement and -- well, it

      23   was inspection and diagnostic of computers and

      24   computer equipment along with replacement.


                                                        32




       1        Q    And was Power ER somebody that you

       2   recommended or hired or somebody they

       3   recommended or hired?

       4        A    It was a contractor the insured was

       5   comfortable with using --

       6        Q    Okay.

       7        A    -- so we worked with them to review.

       8        Q    Okay.

       9        A    There's next the photographs of said

      10   computers.

      11             Next appears to be the telephone

      12   system replacement of which they upgraded a

      13   conference phone, so it was eliminated from

      14   the list.

      15        Q    Okay.  That's the Ironman Consulting

      16   invoice?

      17        A    It is, yes.  Dated July 24th.

      18             There's a second one from Ironman, I

      19   believe it's for, looks like configuration of

      20   the firewall, 500 gigabyte storage unit.

      21             Then we have proposal for the -- I

      22   believe this was the security system.

      23        Q    Okay.  So --

      24        A    From CzarStar Security.


                                                        33




       1        Q    So they had a security system at the

       2   old facility?

       3        A    Yes.

       4        Q    And is this going into the temporary

       5   facility or their new permanent facility?

       6        A    I don't recall.

       7        Q    Okay.  And do you know whether or

       8   not they had any type of fire alarms or smoke

       9   detectors or anything like that in the old

      10   facility?

      11        A    I would have to review again.  But I

      12   don't recall at this time.

      13        Q    Okay.  Why don't you keep going

      14   ahead.  I'm sorry to interrupt.

      15        A    This looks like this is actually

      16   inventory list number 4.

      17        Q    Okay.  And when you say inventory

      18   list number 4, just so the record is clear,

      19   it's the one that has October 1 through

      20   December 15 of 2016?

      21        A    It is.  It got pinched in with the

      22   invoices.

      23        Q    And again, did you review this

      24   inventory list number 4 to verify that all


                                                        34




       1   this equipment was there?

       2        A    I would have similarly to the rest

       3   of them, yes.

       4        Q    Okay.  And other than receiving the

       5   receipts from the insured, did you do anything

       6   to verify the cost that they were setting

       7   forth?

       8        A    It was review of the receipts.

       9        Q    Okay.

      10        A    And validating.

      11        Q    And was there any attempt to

      12   identify the actual cash value of any of the

      13   items that are listed on that inventory?

      14        A    No.

      15        Q    Okay.  You can put that one back

      16   together, actually.

      17        A    Okay.

      18        Q    I'm going to now show you a document

      19   which we'll mark as Exhibit No. 6, which that

      20   is listed as the Master List of Scrapped

      21   Items, and ask you if you can tell us what

      22   that is, please?

       4                  THE WITNESS:  This is a list of

       5        items that were not replaced by the

       6        insured.

       7   BY MR. BLUM:

       8        Q    So these are items that were in the

       9   property and after the fire they were

      10   scrapped?

      11        A    Economically unsalvageable, not

      12   worth anything -- I wouldn't say not worth

      13   anything, but just of no value -- or

      14   comparison to clean versus replacement versus

      15   keeping just didn't make sense to the insured.

      16   While they were still in use, I was told that,

      17   for an example, he had four power drills, I

      18   don't recall, but let's say he had four power

      19   drills, he only really needs two anymore.  All

      20   four power drills worked and were used, but he

      21   really only needs two anymore.  So that's

      22   where he would scrap two of them.

      23        Q    Okay.  And on this particular list

      24   there is a columns of Original Cost, Age,


                                                        36




       1   Scrap Value, Replacement Cost, and Status.

       2   Okay?

       3        A    Uh-huh.

       4        Q    Can you tell us what your

       5   understanding of each of those columns was?

       6        A    His estimate at the original cost,

       7   obviously the age of the individual items, he

       8   estimated a 20% scrap value of the items, and

       9   to replace them is the values in that

      10   replacement column.  Status, I don't recall

      11   what SC is.  My guess would be scrapped.

      12        Q    Okay.  And the scrap value estimated

      13   at 20%, did you have any discussion with him

      14   about where that percentage came from?

      15        A    It was a number that he pulled to

      16   which going through the list it was determined

      17   that some were high, some were low, but we

      18   just stuck with the 20% scrap value.

      19        Q    And did you verify that all of these

      20   items were actually in the property?

      21        A    Yes, similarly to the four previous

      22   inventory lists.

      23        Q    All right.  And so is it your

      24   understanding that what the insured was paid


                                                        37




       1   was the scrap value on these?

       2        A    That is my understanding, yes.

       3        Q    And you did not do anything to

       4   independently verify what the scrap value or

       5   replacement value was on any of those items?

       6        A    No.  By the time I had received this

       7   list, the Knechel -- Knechel Demolition and

       8   Excavating was completed and these were within

       9   the building when they demoed it and discarded

      10   it.

      11        Q    Okay.  I'm going to show you a

      12   document which we are going to mark as Exhibit

      13   7 to your deposition.

      20   BY MR. BLUM:

      21        Q    Could you please tell us what

      22   Exhibit No. 7 is?

      23        A    It appears to be my cover letter of

      24   where I released a prepared Sworn Statement in


                                                        38




       1   Proof of Loss and the executed return of that

       2   same form.

       3        Q    Okay.  What is your understanding of

       4   what is a Sworn Statement in Proof of Loss?

       5        A    It is an agreement of scope and

       6   value to that scope.

       7        Q    So that's the last page of the

       8   document; is that correct?

       9        A    Yes.

      10        Q    And the numbers in the center where

      11   it has Business Personal Property, who put all

      12   those numbers in that form?

      13        A    I would have.

      14        Q    And did you provide this to

      15   Mr. Smith to execute?

      16        A    Yes.

      17        Q    And did he in fact execute and

      18   return it to you?

      19        A    Yes.

      20        Q    And my understanding is that

      21   according to this form, up until the date of

      22   this, which is November 23, 2016, he had

      23   received $62,899.51 in advances; is that

      24   correct?


                                                        39




       1        A    Correct.

       2        Q    And that he was still owed

       3   $22,065.73?

       4        A    Per documentation received to date,

       5   yeah.

       6        Q    Okay.  I'm going to show you a

       7   document which we're going to mark as Exhibit

       8   No. 8.

       9                       - - -

      12        attachment, no Bates numbers, marked Farr

      13        Exhibit 8.)

      14                       - - -

      15   BY MR. BLUM:

      16        Q    Can you tell us what that is,

      17   please?

      18        A    This would have been my cover letter

      19   of my prepared Sworn Statement in Proof of

      20   Loss final and then the executed form of the

      21   Sworn Statement in Proof of Loss, the final

      22   one.

      23        Q    Okay.  And now, on this document

      24   there is in the letter portion, your letter


                                                        40




       1   portion, there is a list of invoices.  Where

       2   did that list come from?

       3        A    I created the list.

       4        Q    Okay.  And is the BPP, is that

       5   business personal property?

       6        A    Yes.

       7        Q    And so is it accurate that as of

       8   May 31st of 2017 the total that was paid out

       9   to the insured on business personal property

      10   was $117,389.17?

      11        A    That was final settlement

      12   recommendation, yes.

      13        Q    Okay.  Than I take it from the way

      14   the next portion of it is, all of that had

      15   been paid except for $14,077?

      16        A    Correct.

      17        Q    Again, if we look at the last page,

      18   that's the actual Sworn Statement in Proof of

      19   Loss; correct?

      20        A    Yes.

      21        Q    And the business personal property

      22   numbers which are listed across in the row

      23   there, are they numbers which you personally

      24   put on there?


                                                        41




       1        A    They are.

       2        Q    Okay.  And did you provide this to

       3   Mr. Smith?

       4        A    I did.

       5        Q    And did he in fact sign it and

       6   return it to you?

       7        A    He did.

       8        Q    I'm going to show you a document

       9   which we'll mark as Exhibit No. 9, if we

      10   could.

      16   BY MR. BLUM:

      17        Q    Can you tell us what is Exhibit 9?

      18        A    It's a copy of my final report to

      19   Cap Specialty and Paul Petrovich.

      20        Q    And is it then accurate that after

      21   June 12th of 2017 you did not have any further

      22   activity or any actions that you took on this

      23   loss?

      24        A    Up until recently.


                                                        42




       1        Q    Okay.

       2        A    When I was requested to provide a

       3   deposition.

       4        Q    Okay.  But in terms of the actual

       5   adjustment of the loss --

       6        A    Correct, that would have been it.

       7   Sorry.

       8        Q    That's all right.  In the reserves,

       9   it shows here BPP $120,000.  Is that something

      10   that you had personally recommended?

      11        A    Yes.

      12        Q    All right.  And the BI, is that

      13   business interruption with extra expense?

      14        A    Yes.

      15        Q    Did you personally provide that

      16   reserve also or recommend that reserve?

      17        A    I did early on and it maintained

      18   itself throughout.  But, to be honest, I don't

      19   know if it was accurate or not.

      20        Q    Okay.  And if we turn to the second

      21   page of your letter, does this indicate that

      22   the total payout on the business personal

      23   property was in fact $117,389.17?

      24        A    Less a $1,000 deductible.


                                                        43




       1        Q    And in fact after taking out the

       2   deductible, is it accurate that as of the date

       3   of your letter, all of that had been paid to

       4   the insured?

       5        A    Yes.  I'm sorry, let me restate.

       6   No.  14,000 had not been paid yet as of the

       7   authoring of this letter.

       8        Q    Why had that not been paid?

       9        A    Because it was being requested with

      10   this report.

      11        Q    Okay.  And so when that 14,000 would

      12   have been paid, then the total amount would

      13   have been reimbursed to the insured?

      14        A    Yes.

      15        Q    All right.  I'll show you a document

      16   which we'll mark as Exhibit No. 10.

      23        Q    Can you tell us what this document

      24   is?

       1        A    This is the log of S-Bond employees

       2   personally cleaning their own equipment

       3   following the loss.

       4        Q    Okay.  And did you take part in

       5   verifying that any of this activity had

       6   actually taken place?

       7        A    No.  I took the insured's word for

       8   it based upon his log and detail.

       9        Q    And was he in fact, was the insured

      10   in fact reimbursed for all of this expense?

      11        A    At a cleaning rate I am to believe

      12   he was, yes.

      13        Q    And did you personally do anything

      14   to verify any of the extra expenses that the

      15   client had in terms of their additional

      16   rental?

      17        A    No.

      18        Q    And did you verify any of the other

      19   extra expenses other than the cleaning expense

      20   which was submitted by the insured?

      21        A    No.

      22        Q    And we looked at your final report

      23   as one of the exhibits, it was report number

      24   8, Exhibit No. 9.  Is it accurate that there


                                                        45




       1   were interim reports that you put together

       2   that led up to that report?

       3        A    Yes.  There would have been seven

       4   previous reports.

       5        Q    And those seven reports would have

       6   detailed the inventories and payments as they

       7   progressed up until the final report?

       8        A    Yes.

       9        Q    Is there anything else that you can

      10   think of that you did on the adjustment of

      11   this loss?

      12        A    No.

      13        Q    All right.  Have you had any

      14   discussions with Mr. Smith since the time of

      15   your completion of the adjustment of loss in

      16   June of 2017?

      17        A    No.

      18        Q    Did you know him before this

      19   occurred?

      20        A    No.

      21        Q    And had you ever been to that

      22   property before this occurred?

      23        A    I do not believe so, no.

      24        Q    Have you been involved in any


                                                        46




       1   meetings with any other insurance companies

       2   about the investigation of this loss or the

       3   adjustment of this loss?

       4        A    No.

       5        Q    Have you had any meetings with

       6   public officials about the loss?

       7        A    No.

       8        Q    And have you attended any

       9   inspections of the vehicle allegedly involved

      10   in the loss?

      11        A    No.

      12                  MR. BLUM:  I have no further

      13        questions.

      14                  MR. SARA:  I have no questions.

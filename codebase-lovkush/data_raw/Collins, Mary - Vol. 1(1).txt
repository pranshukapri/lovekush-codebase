 3                      10:10 a.m.
 4   -----------------------------------------------
 5            MR. SUGARMAN:  Counsel have agreed
 6   that all objections, except those as to the
 7   form of the question, will be reserved until
 8   the time of trial, and all motions to strike
 9   also reserved until the time of trial.  And an
10   objection by one defense counsel, either
11   present in the room or on the phone, will
12   constitute an objection by all.  Agreed,
13   Mr. Deaton.
14            MR. DEATON:  Yes, sir.
15            MR. SUGARMAN:  And Ms. Collins, what
16   will happen is when the deposition is
17   completed, a week or so later, your attorney
18   will receive a copy of the written transcript
19   and you'll have 30 days to read it over and
20   make any changes that you feel are needed, if
21   any.  If 30 days goes by and you don't submit
22   written changes, it's going to be understood
23   that the transcript was accurate.  Fair enough?
24            THE WITNESS:  Sure.
0014
 1            MR. SUGARMAN:  And if you need more
 2   time for any reason, just let John know, and
 3   we'll be happy to grant you some additional
 4   time.  Okay?
 5            THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Thank you.
 6            MR. SUGARMAN:  And further, an
 7   appearance at today's deposition, either,
 8   again, in person or on the phone, doesn't
 9   constitute a waiver that any defendant may have
10   based on service of process or jurisdiction.
11            Can you swear her in?
12            MR. DEATON:  Before we do that, I'd
13   like to state something on the record, which is
14   Ms. Collins is here today as primarily a
15   damages witness to discuss, obviously, the
16   impact that the mesothelioma has had on her
17   husband, herself, the family, and the
18   consequences resulting from his disease.
19            She is also -- has personal
20   information related to a product that Buck
21   testified to using on their children and
22   whatnot.  Other than that, that would be what I
23   intend to offer her at trial for.
24            Now, with that said, obviously, she
0015
 1   may be able to corroborate that she saw him do
 2   general automotive work or that she knows of a
 3   store that he purchased, but I do not intend to
 4   offer her as a product ID witness of saying,
 5   you know, he used this particular brand on this
 6   particular ...
 7            So I don't believe there's a need for
 8   certainly a lot of questions by the defense.
 9   With that said, if the defense opens the door
10   and, for example, brings out what would
11   normally be called hearsay testimony that he
12   said that he used such and such, I will use
13   that for purposes of defeating any summary
14   judgment motion.  Okay.
15            So I wouldn't open the door if I were
16   the defense attorney on those areas of inquiry,
17   but I'll leave that up to you, but I wanted to
18   make sure what my intent of her is at trial.
19            MR. SUGARMAN:  I think that I
20   understand, and I think the way that I will
21   frame my questions will hopefully establish
22   that.
23            MR. DEATON:  Sure.  I just didn't want
24   there to be any confusion.  If a defense
0016
 1   attorney starts asking those questions and then
 2   files a summary judgment and then I rely on
 3   certain answers that I wasn't going to even
 4   ask, I didn't want them to turn around and say,
 5   oh, you said you weren't going to use her as a
 6   product ID witness.  That's all.  If the door
 7   gets opened, it gets opened.

13                EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
14   BY MR. SUGARMAN:
15       Q.   Good morning, Ms. Collins.
16       A.   Good morning.
17       Q.   My name is Larry Sugarman.  I'm one of
18   the defense attorneys, and I'm going to be
19   asking you the initial questions today.  I
20   represent several of the defendants in your
21   lawsuit.
22            Just to go over a few quick ground
23   rules to help today go smoothly, the first is
24   although it feels like we're having a
0017
 1   conversation back and forth, the court reporter
 2   is taking everything down that we both say
 3   while we're on the record.  For that reason,
 4   I'd ask that you do your best, and I will do
 5   the same, not to talk over one another.
 6            There will be many times when I start
 7   asking the question and you will know what the
 8   rest of the question is going to be, but I just
 9   ask to do your best to allow me to finish my
10   entire question, and I will do my best not to
11   begin a new question while you're in the middle
12   of an answer.  Okay?
13       A.   Yeah.
14       Q.   Because, again, we're creating a
15   transcript.  In conversation it's very normal
16   and acceptable to shake your head or say uh-huh
17   because people know what you mean, but again,
18   because this is for a court proceeding, because
19   we have a court reporter, just do your best to
20   give verbal responses to questions.  Okay?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   If you can do your best just to keep
23   your voice up so people on the phone and in the
24   back of the room can hear you, that will be
0018
 1   appreciated.  That, I can tell, already is
 2   going to be our biggest challenge.
 3       A.   I'll do my best.
 4       Q.   I may ask questions from time to time
 5   that are just poor questions.  Again, I didn't
 6   come with a perfectly written list of questions
 7   that are grammatically correct.  So if I ask a
 8   question that doesn't sound right to you or
 9   it's confusing, it's probably just a bad
10   question by me.
11            So if that happens, don't answer it.
12   Just tell me I don't understand the question,
13   could you rephrase it, and I'm happy to.
14       A.   Okay.
15       Q.   Because if you answer a question,
16   we're going to assume you understood it.  Fair
17   enough?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   If at any point in time you need a
20   break, you just get emotional or need a
21   restroom break or anything, just let us know.
22   Okay?
23       A.   Okay.
24       Q.   We'll start off easy.  Can you tell us
0019
 1   your full name?
 2       A.   Mary Margaret Collins.
 3       Q.   And what is your maiden name?
 4       A.   Carmichael.
 5       Q.   And your current age?
 6       A.   63.
 7       Q.   And what is your date of birth?
 8       A.   7/11/56.
 9       Q.   Just a very brief background on
10   yourself.  Can you tell me where you were born?
11       A.   Born in Connecticut.  Raised in
12   Massachusetts.  I'm the fourth oldest of ten
13   kids.  Married my husband 37 years ago.
14       Q.   And this is the only marriage you ever
15   had, correct?
16       A.   That's correct.
17       Q.   And any children you've had have all
18   been with Mr. Collins, correct?
19       A.   That's correct.
20       Q.   Can you tell me your highest level of
21   education?
22       A.   Some college.
23       Q.   Where did you go?
24       A.   ULowell, BC, Rivier.
0020
 1       Q.   Did you receive any types of degrees?
 2       A.   No.
 3       Q.   And has there been a particular area
 4   where you've concentrated your work?
 5       A.   Initially, it was publications.  And
 6   now it's religious studies.
 7       Q.   And when you say "publications," could
 8   you give us an idea of what that is?
 9       A.   Book design, graphic design, so
10   that's -- my background is in publication, so
11   anything written.  Did a lot of government
12   work.
13       Q.   What area of government work did you
14   do publications in?
15       A.   Proposals for computer software
16   companies.
17       Q.   Okay.  And when did you stop doing the
18   publication work and shift into religious
19   education?
20       A.   20 years ago.
21       Q.   Okay.  Are you currently working?
22       A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.
23       Q.   And who are you employed by?
24       A.   The Diocese of Boston at Saint Anne's,
0021
 1   Saint Catherine's Parish in Westford.
 2       Q.   How long have you been employed by
 3   them?
 4       A.   12 years.
 5       Q.   And what is your title with them?
 6       A.   Director of confirmation.
 7       Q.   Is that full-time work?
 8       A.   30 hours.
 9       Q.   And how long has the job been 30 hours
10   a week?
11       A.   That's a good question.  How long has
12   it been 30 hours a week?  I don't remember.
13       Q.   That's okay.
14       A.   Because I really get paid for 30, you
15   know.
16       Q.   You put in more?
17       A.   Yes.  So when did I get paid for 30?
18   It was probably about five years ago, maybe
19   six.
20       Q.   For the last five or six years, your
21   work has been pretty constant?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   Okay.  And your job title has stayed
24   the same for the last five to six years?
0022
 1       A.   I was coordinator and then recently
 2   promoted to director.
 3       Q.   Do you have a time period where you
 4   plan to stop working and fully retire?
 5       A.   Well, my plan was 65.  I don't know
 6   what the plan is now.
 7       Q.   Okay.  And why?
 8       A.   Because my husband had to retire five
 9   years before he was planning on.
10       Q.   Okay.  So for right now, are you
11   certain that you will work past 65, or you're
12   just not quite sure yet?
13       A.   I don't know.  My plan would be to
14   retire at 65.  That's what my plan was, but I
15   don't know what I'm going to be able to do.  I
16   still have a daughter in college, so getting
17   her through that is a priority.
18       Q.   Now, you have two daughters, correct?
19       A.   Uh-huh.
20       Q.   And what are their names and ages?
21       A.   Molly will be 30 this week, I think,
22   the 19th, whenever that is, of October.  She
23   will turn 30.  And Anna is 22, and she's the
24   one in college.
0023
 1       Q.   Where is Anna in college?
 2       A.   Northeastern, so it's nice.
 3       Q.   What year is she in?
 4       A.   Her senior year.
 5       Q.   Do either Molly or Anna live with you?
 6       A.   Uh-huh.
 7       Q.   Which?
 8       A.   Molly does.
 9       Q.   Okay.  Does Molly work outside of the
10   home?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   What does she do?
13       A.   She right now is working full-time for
14   a dog company up in Andover.  She's kind of --
15   she's putting her life on hold to be home with
16   us.
17       Q.   Did she move back in?  Meaning, was
18   she living on her own and then she moved back
19   in because of what happened with your husband?
20       A.   She was -- she moved home after
21   school, and then started to apply for jobs and
22   then pulled back.
23       Q.   Okay.  So how long has she been at
24   home with you and your husband?
0024
 1       A.   She's been home with us -- well, since
 2   she graduated college, which was 2016.
 3       Q.   But again, if your husband hadn't been
 4   sick, was the plan for her to move out?
 5       A.   She probably would be overseas right
 6   now.  That was her plan.  On top of her degree,
 7   she went and got certified to teach English as
 8   a second language, and that's what her interest
 9   is.  So right now she's volunteering locally
10   teaching English as a second language, but she
11   wanted to go overseas to do that.  So she's
12   putting everything on hold.
13       Q.   Does Anna commute to school, or does
14   she live on campus?
15       A.   She lives on campus.  She's working.
16   She's doing a lot.
17       Q.   Let's say this past summer, did she
18   come back to live at home, or did she stay?
19       A.   Yes, she was living at home.
20       Q.   Is Molly financially dependent upon
21   you and your husband?
22       A.   No.
23       Q.   How about Anna?
24       A.   Yes.
0025
 1       Q.   Where Anna is a senior, do you know
 2   what her plan is after graduation?
 3       A.   Her plan is to continue on to get her
 4   master's degree in public health.  That's what
 5   her plan is, but, you know, you just have to
 6   wait and see and take one day at a time.  And
 7   right now it's get her bachelor's degree and
 8   graduate in May.  She's already working on her
 9   master's.  She works 20 hours a week -- no,
10   excuse me, 15 hours a week, is an RA,
11   volunteers.
12            She's a good kid.  She needed to work
13   so she could afford to have a car at school so
14   that she can come home.  She comes home on the
15   weekends a lot.
16       Q.   Thinking back, when do you think you
17   first met Mr. Collins?  And again, there may be
18   a difference between when you started dating
19   versus maybe you knew him through school.
20       A.   Oh, definitely.
21       Q.   When do you think you first met him
22   for the first time?
23       A.   I first met him when I was 18.  He was
24   a friend of my older brother's.
0026
 1       Q.   Just because I can't do math that
 2   quickly, if you were 18, what year do you
 3   recall that would have been?
 4       A.   Probably 1975.
 5       Q.   Okay.
 6       A.   Because I graduated high school in
 7   '74.
 8       Q.   And when you first met him, did you
 9   start dating shortly thereafter?
10       A.   No, we were friends for -- we didn't
11   start dating until I was in my 20s, and I can't
12   remember how old I was, probably 22 or 23,
13   something like that.
14       Q.   Okay.  And then how old were you -- I
15   know you were married in 1981.  How old were
16   you then?
17       A.   I was -- I think I just turned 25.
18       Q.   Okay.  So you dated for two or three
19   years before you got married?
20       A.   So if I was -- well, I was 24 in July.
21   We got married in August, so I was just 25, and
22   we dated for about a year and a half.
23       Q.   Okay.
24       A.   So whatever that made my age.
0027
 1       Q.   Okay.
 2            MR. DEATON:  What year were you
 3   married?
 4            THE WITNESS:  1981.
 5       Q.   August 29, 1981?
 6       A.   Uh-huh.
 7       Q.   Yes?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9            MR. DEATON:  Thank you.
10       Q.   All right.  Now, when you first met
11   your husband, he's a few years older than you
12   are, correct?
13       A.   Correct.
14       Q.   So when you first met him, you're 18
15   and he's either 21 or 22; does that sound
16   right?
17       A.   Yeah, sounds right.
18       Q.   Do you remember when you first met
19   him, if he had any jobs, what he was doing for
20   work?
21       A.   He was a truck driver.
22       Q.   Do you remember what company?
23       A.   No.
24       Q.   Do you know if that was Sito
0028
 1   Industries?  Only if you remember.
 2       A.   I don't remember, to be honest with
 3   you.
 4       Q.   Do you remember if he was driving back
 5   and forth from Massachusetts to California?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   Okay.
 8       A.   And delivered picture frames.  I
 9   remember that much.  I don't remember the
10   company.
11       Q.   Do you have knowledge one way or the
12   other if he did any type of mechanical work on
13   trucks for that company?
14       A.   I don't have knowledge of that.  I
15   never traveled with him when he did that.
16       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall approximately how
17   long he worked for Sito before he had his next
18   job?
19       A.   I don't know because I don't know how
20   long he was working for them.
21       Q.   Okay.  Mr. Collins told us that he
22   worked for Sito Industries from 1976 to 1978,
23   for about two years.
24       A.   Okay.
0029
 1       Q.   And that his next job was for Canada
 2   Dry; do you remember that?
 3       A.   Yeah, I do, because we were dating at
 4   that point.
 5            MR. DEATON:  I'm going to interrupt
 6   you two.  There's going to be times when an
 7   attorney says that Buck testified at his
 8   deposition to something.  And what Larry just
 9   said is very accurate, and most of the time I'm
10   sure the attorney will be accurate, but you're
11   here to testify to your memory so I just don't
12   want anyone referencing what Buck said or
13   didn't say because they may be accurate, may be
14   a little inaccurate.  Just go based on your
15   memory.
16       Q.   And again, the reason, frankly, I'm
17   doing it is just to help you and to help it
18   move along, but if at any point in time I ask a
19   question that kind of assumes or I say Buck
20   said something, if it's not your understanding,
21   just tell me.  I'm just trying to move right
22   along with it.  Okay?
23       A.   Sure.
24       Q.   So my understanding from what your
0030
 1   husband told us is that he worked for about six
 2   months in 1979 for Canada Dry, and he washed
 3   out some metal containers that were used to
 4   store syrup used for Canada Dry soda.  Does
 5   that sound right to you, or you just don't
 6   know?
 7       A.   I don't know.  I just know that he was
 8   working at Canada Dry driving a forklift.  He
 9   always did more than what he was hired for.
10       Q.   Okay.  Do you know one way or the
11   other if he did any type of mechanical
12   maintenance or repair while employed by Canada
13   Dry?
14       A.   I don't know.
15       Q.   Mr. Collins told us after working for
16   Canada Dry he went to work for Westinghouse in
17   Westborough, Mass.; does that sound right to
18   you?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   He told us he was there for about 15
21   months in 1980 and 1981; sound about right to
22   you?
23       A.   (Nodding.)
24       Q.   Yes?
0031
 1       A.   Yes, I'm sorry.
 2       Q.   Do you recall what type of work he did
 3   for Westinghouse?
 4       A.   Manufacturing.
 5       Q.   Okay.
 6       A.   That's all I know.
 7       Q.   You don't know anything more than
 8   that?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   Okay.
11       A.   He would come home with metal burrs on
12   him, and it would be like get rid of that
13   before you come in the house.  That's about it.
14   That's all I know.  I never really asked him
15   what he did there.
16       Q.   And then next he told us that he
17   worked for Varian Vacuum in Lexington,
18   Massachusetts?
19       A.   Correct.
20       Q.   Do you recall what he did for Varian
21   Vacuum?
22       A.   It was a manufacturing job.  That's
23   all I know.  He was a machinist, or he was
24   going in that direction.
0032
 1       Q.   Okay.
 2       A.   Building up his portfolio for that.
 3       Q.   Do you know if he did any type of
 4   maintenance or repair work on any equipment at
 5   Varian Vacuum?
 6       A.   I don't know.
 7       Q.   Okay.  And then Mr. Collins told us
 8   that after he was at Varian Vacuum for about a
 9   year, he left and went to W.R. Grace Chometrics
10   [sic]?
11       A.   Chomerics.
12       Q.   In Woburn, and he worked there from
13   1984 to 1991; does that sound right to you?
14       A.   Well, he definitely worked there.  I
15   can't confirm that those were the dates, but he
16   definitely worked there.
17       Q.   And do you have an understanding of
18   what he did while employed there?
19       A.   I don't remember.  I'm just assuming
20   that everything went according to what he was
21   trying to build was to become a CNC machinist.
22       Q.   And while he was at W.R. Grace
23   Chomerics, do you know one way or the other if
24   he did any type of maintenance or repair work
0033
 1   on any equipment there?
 2       A.   No, I don't.
 3       Q.   Okay.  And then Mr. Collins told us
 4   that after he left W.R. Grace, he worked for
 5   Laser Fare Industries in Smithfield, Rhode
 6   Island; does that sound right to you?
 7       A.   Yeah.  I forgot about that one.
 8       Q.   He said that he worked there from 1991
 9   to 1995 as a CAD/CAM engineer.  Does that sound
10   right to you?
11       A.   Exactly.
12       Q.   And do you know what his job duties
13   covered there?
14       A.   Other than programming and operating
15   the equipment, I don't know anything beyond
16   that.
17       Q.   Okay.  And then he worked for a place
18   called Metal Spinners?
19       A.   Uh-huh.
20       Q.   Yes?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   And that was in Malden, Mass.?
23       A.   Correct.
24       Q.   And he said he was a laser production
0034
 1   engineer; does that sound right to you?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   Do you know anything more about what
 4   he did work-wise there?
 5       A.   I actually only know from him telling
 6   me what he would do and how much the owners
 7   relied on him.  If a machine went down, they
 8   called him.  He would repair it, basically
 9   saving them a lot of money so they didn't have
10   to call in the repair people from the companies
11   that put the machines in there.
12       Q.   And when you're talking about doing
13   repair work, do you know, for example, if the
14   repair work he's doing is more computer-based
15   versus kind of getting your hands dirty taking
16   apart the machines?
17       A.   Correct.  It was taking apart the
18   machines and getting it up and running again.
19       Q.   Okay.  Do you know one way or the
20   other if any of these machines contained any
21   asbestos components?
22       A.   I would have no way of knowing that.
23       Q.   Okay.  And again, Mr. Collins told us
24   he worked at Laser Technologies -- back up --
0035
 1   strike that.
 2            Mr. Collins told us he worked at Metal
 3   Spinners from 1995 until about 2000.  Does that
 4   sound about right to you?
 5       A.   Sounds about right.
 6       Q.   And then next he told us he worked at
 7   Laser Technologies in Concord, Massachusetts
 8   from 2000 to 2002 as a project engineer and CNC
 9   production engineer.  Does that sound right to
10   you?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Do you know during his employment at
13   Laser Technologies whether he did any
14   maintenance or repair work on any equipment at
15   that facility?
16       A.   I think at that point he pretty much
17   did whatever was required to get the job out
18   the door.  And if that was to fix the equipment
19   or program the equipment, he would do both.
20       Q.   Okay.  Do you know one way or the
21   other if Mr. Collins would have worked with or
22   around any asbestos products or components
23   there?
24       A.   No, I wouldn't know that.
0036
 1       Q.   Okay.  And then Mr. Collins told us
 2   that after he left Laser Technologies in 2002,
 3   he next worked at Route 3A Motors in North
 4   Chelmsford, Massachusetts as a parts manager?
 5       A.   Correct.
 6       Q.   Does that sound right to you?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   Do you know what he did as a parts
 9   manager at Route 3A Motors?
10       A.   Pretty much organized and displayed
11   the equipment coming in and sold it.  That's
12   it.
13       Q.   Do you know one way or the other if
14   Mr. Collins worked with or around any asbestos
15   components or parts while employed by Route 3A
16   Motors?
17       A.   I have no idea.
18       Q.   Okay.  And then Mr. Collins told us
19   that when he left Route 3A Motors in 2006, he
20   then went on to work -- go back to Metal
21   Spinners?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   And that he worked at Metal Spinners
24   for the second time starting in 2006?
0037
 1       A.   Uh-huh.
 2       Q.   And then do you know at what point in
 3   time he stopped?
 4       A.   July of this year.
 5       Q.   Okay.
 6       A.   July 31.  He retired on that day.
 7       Q.   Okay.
 8       A.   Sadly.
 9       Q.   I mean, as you know, we had the
10   opportunity to speak with your husband, so we
11   already know a lot of the details, and I'll try
12   and keep it kind of brief and to the point
13   because I know it's obviously emotional for
14   you.
15            I know he may have officially retired
16   on July 31st of 2018, but was there a point in
17   time when before that that he just couldn't
18   work anymore?  Meaning like he stopped working
19   at a certain point of time even though his
20   retirement date was later?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   Do you recall when that was?
23       A.   Sometime in May.
24       Q.   May of 2018?
0038
 1       A.   Correct.
 2       Q.   Okay.  And at that time how did he or
 3   the two of you together decide that he wasn't
 4   going to work anymore past May of 2018?
 5            MR. DEATON:  Whenever you need a
 6   break, you can take it, Hon.  I just want you
 7   to know.  It's at your convenience.
 8       A.   He had no quality of life, couldn't
 9   get out of the chair.  And I told him, I said,
10   why don't you retire and get that stress off of
11   your shoulders.  And so he agreed because it
12   was always about work calling, how are you
13   doing, do you think you're coming back soon.
14   I'm like, you just got to get that off, so
15   that's why we decided to do it.
16       Q.   Okay.  When he left the company, was
17   there any type of severance package or
18   retirement plan that he had?
19       A.   Initially, no.  I called his -- I was
20   the one communicating with his boss and saying
21   that I think this is the road we're going to be
22   going down, and what is the severance package.
23   And he said, well, there isn't one.
24            So then when Buck and I talked -- I
0039
 1   don't know how you refer to him -- I called him
 2   back and I told him that this was not our plan
 3   and if he could consider having, you know, do
 4   something because he was just a valuable
 5   employee, and he said he'd get back to me.  And
 6   so he did the next day.  He had talked to his
 7   brother the night before.  And they had decided
 8   to give Buck a package based on the number of
 9   years that he was there, and I think it rounded
10   out to about 7,500 dollars.
11       Q.   7,500 dollars a month, a year?
12       A.   No, total.  That was the severance
13   package before taxes.
14       Q.   And since Mr. Collins retired in July
15   of 2018, has he done any other type of work
16   even if part-time?
17       A.   No.
18       Q.   Now, just shifting gears a little bit.
19   Mr. Collins told us about your two daughters
20   and how when they were infants and required
21   diaper changes that both of you would
22   participate?
23       A.   Correct.
24       Q.   Can you tell us, for your older
0040
 1   daughter Molly, how long was she in diapers,
 2   approximately?  We won't tell her you told us.
 3       A.   Please don't.  I called her
 4   pediatrician crying one day saying, I can't
 5   believe she's still in diapers.  She said,
 6   don't worry, I never heard of a kid going off
 7   to college wearing one.  But anyways, she was
 8   very late wearing a diaper.  She was probably
 9   about three.  Yeah, it was three because my
10   father was helping us at that point with her so
11   I could start work.
12       Q.   So from the time she's a newborn until
13   about age three, she's in diapers?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   And then when it came just to Molly
16   for that period of time, responsibility between
17   you and your husband for changing diapers, how
18   did that break down?  Meaning -- and again, I
19   don't want you to get the wrong idea thinking
20   on this particular day I did it; on that
21   particular day he did it.  Just if you look at
22   that three-year period of time.
23       A.   General.
24            MR. DEATON:  And if it helps to take
0041
 1   first year, second year, third year, he just
 2   wants you to break it down any way that you
 3   can.
 4       Q.   Whatever is comfortable for you.  Just
 5   over that three-year period of time if you had
 6   to break down between you and your husband what
 7   percentage of the time you changed diapers
 8   versus he did it?
 9       A.   A standard day would be him going to
10   work at 5:00 in the morning and coming back at
11   3:00 in the afternoon.  So from 3 to 5, he had
12   her.  He wanted her.  I cooked.  It allowed me
13   to do other things around the house.
14            So from that other time -- so half the
15   day, she was all mine.  The other half of the
16   day, she was all his.  And he would get up in
17   the middle of the night, change her diaper, let
18   me sleep.
19       Q.   But roughly, if you can, and I don't
20   want you to guess, but just roughly if you had
21   to think, I'm not trying to put numbers in your
22   head either, but did you change the diapers
23   half the time and he did it half the time, or
24   did you do it more than he did it overall?
0042
 1            MR. DEATON:  Don't guess unless you
 2   know.
 3       A.   I don't know.
 4            MR. DEATON:  But if you can give Larry
 5   a fair estimate, again, including when he's at
 6   work and you're at home, you know, any way that
 7   you can do it is what he's looking at.
 8       A.   I think that's how I would say it is
 9   that from 5 to 3 she was mine, and from 3 to
10   5 --
11            MR. DEATON:  When you say "5 to 3,"
12   what period of the day?
13       A.   That's 5 a.m.
14       Q.   To 3 p.m.?
15       A.   To 3 p.m.
16       Q.   And then when he came home, he would
17   take care of her from 3 in the afternoon until
18   5 in the morning?
19       A.   Basically.
20       Q.   Roughly?
21       A.   Roughly.  And that was the first year.
22   We were real hands on and we both wanted to --
23   I had my way of playing with her, and he had
24   his way.  And you know, he wanted to do
0043
 1   everything that I was doing, feeding her,
 2   bathing her, you know.  He was a very hands-on
 3   dad.
 4       Q.   And for diaper changes, did you and
 5   Mr. Collins, you know, put anything on Molly
 6   before the new diaper was put on such as a
 7   cream or powders, anything like that?
 8       A.   Well, ideally, we would wipe her clean
 9   and then powder her.  And if she had a rash or
10   anything, then we would put, like, a cream on
11   her like a Desitin or something and still
12   powder her, yeah, dry her up, so to speak.
13       Q.   And for any of the powders that you
14   used on Molly, you know, when she was in
15   diapers, do you remember the brand names, trade
16   names, or manufacturers' names?
17       A.   Absolutely.  It was Johnson & Johnson
18   baby powder.  I grew up on it, powdered all my
19   siblings with it.  It was what you did.
20       Q.   Now, how about with respect to Anna,
21   how long was she in diapers?
22       A.   She was a quick study.  She was out of
23   diapers by two.
24       Q.   Okay.  And with respect to Anna, if
0044
 1   you can, can you give us a sense as to how
 2   often it was that you would change her diapers
 3   versus Mr. Collins?
 4       A.   I would have to say the same because I
 5   was working when Anna came along, so he
 6   definitely had full responsibility when I went
 7   off to work.
 8       Q.   And just so we're clear, when you say
 9   "same," what you mean is that the division of
10   labor for Anna was similar to what it was for
11   Molly?
12       A.   Exactly.
13       Q.   Okay.  And did you continue to use
14   some type of a powder when putting new diapers
15   on her?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   And did you and Mr. Collins use the
18   same products and follow the same process?
19       A.   Well, I wasn't there to say what his
20   process was, but I believe that that's what he
21   did.  We always had the same products.  You
22   know, we used it when we went to the beach to
23   get the sand off of them.  We used it diapering
24   them.  I used it on my own self.  Yeah, I mean,
0045
 1   it was a product that was in the baby's
 2   changing bag, on the table, in my room, in the
 3   beach bag, yeah.
 4       Q.   Okay.  And specific to Anna, what
 5   brand name, trade name, or manufacturer's name
 6   of powder did you use?
 7       A.   The Johnson & Johnson.  It was the
 8   same product.
 9       Q.   Okay.  While you lived with
10   Mr. Collins, do you know whether or not he used
11   any powders on himself?
12       A.   I don't know.
13       Q.   Okay.  Now, something else that
14   Mr. Collins told us about during his deposition
15   was that he had been involved in doing some
16   maintenance and repair work on his own cars and
17   even some motorcycles?
18       A.   Uh-huh.
19       Q.   Yes?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   Now, at what point in time were you
22   aware because you observed it yourself that he
23   would do that type of work?  Like, work on cars
24   or motorcycles?
0046
 1       A.   I have known that about him since when
 2   I first met him.  They were -- that's what the
 3   guys did.  You'd hear all the stories, oh, the
 4   time that Buck had the Volkswagen and it broke
 5   down on 95 going up to the lake or the one that
 6   he stripped down and rebuilt, so you hear all
 7   the stories of his youth before I knew him,
 8   before I really started being part of his life.
 9            But then my first car was a Volkswagen
10   Beetle that he bought for me -- not for me but
11   with me.  I bought it.
12       Q.   At any point in time, did you ever
13   assist him with any type of maintenance or
14   repair work on cars or motorcycles?
15       A.   Hands-on help, you mean, or was I
16   there?
17       Q.   I'll ask that next, but how about
18   actually helping him?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   Were you ever close by where you could
21   watch him work on cars or motorcycles?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Do you remember when that first took
24   place?
0047
 1       A.   When I was dating him.
 2       Q.   Okay.  And how long did that continue,
 3   meaning, how long was it?  Over how many years
 4   do you recall Mr. Collins doing that kind of
 5   work and you seeing him do it?
 6       A.   Again, it was something that he
 7   continued to do, and to the point where he's
 8   sitting on a chair showing my daughter how to
 9   do things so she can take care of her car.  He
10   always worked on our cars.  We never had a
11   mechanic.
12            He was like the neighborhood guru.
13   Anyone had a problem with their car, they'd
14   call him.  Even my mother drove up to my house,
15   lost her power steering just the other day.
16   Buck walks out there and opens up the hood and
17   is like, oh, yeah, this is what's wrong.  The
18   difference is he would have fixed it.  He
19   can't.  He can't do that anymore.  That's what
20   he loved to do.
21       Q.   And from what you just told me about
22   him sitting on a chair and showing your
23   daughter, am I correct that that would be more
24   recent in time?
0048
 1       A.   Yeah.
 2       Q.   Within the last couple of years maybe?
 3       A.   Within this last year, yeah.  He can't
 4   loosen a lug nut.  He can't do things like that
 5   anymore, and that was his life.  He wasn't in a
 6   bar.  He didn't go to bars.  He didn't go out.
 7   He came home and he had his hobbies and he
 8   worked.  He was always home and always doing
 9   things.  He never sat.
10       Q.   Now, if we just focus just for a
11   moment on, say, cars as opposed to motorcycles,
12   just looking at cars, do you have a memory of
13   the different kinds of automotive maintenance
14   or repair work that he would do over the years?
15   Again, I'm not going to --
16       A.   Meaning?
17       Q.   What I'm not going to do is say for
18   this particular car, you know, do you remember
19   what he did.  I'm just trying to get a sense as
20   to over the years the different kinds of
21   maintenance and repair work that you can recall
22   him doing?
23       A.   Oil changes, brake changes.  He's
24   taken engines out and rebuilt cars, complete
0049
 1   engines, mufflers.  He's replaced muffler
 2   systems.  Yeah, he's done a lot.
 3       Q.   And even if it's -- I know it's not
 4   going to be specific to a vehicle but, for
 5   example, for brakes, for any of the brake work
 6   that Mr. Collins did, do you know any of the
 7   brand names, trade names, or manufacturers'
 8   names that he would have worked with?
 9       A.   I'm afraid not.
10       Q.   Okay.  Now, when it comes to engine
11   work and muffler work, sometimes there can be
12   gaskets involved?
13       A.   Uh-huh.
14       Q.   And my question for you is for any
15   gasket that Mr. Collins may have worked with,
16   would you know any brand names, trade names, or
17   manufacturers' names?
18       A.   Unfortunately, I don't.
19       Q.   And parts obviously have to come from
20   a store?
21       A.   Uh-huh.
22       Q.   Correct?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   Do you know over the years any of the
0050
 1   different places where Mr. Collins went to buy
 2   products that were involved in maintaining or
 3   fixing cars?
 4       A.   AutoZone, NAPA.  Those are the two
 5   that stand out in my mind.
 6       Q.   Okay.  And when we were at the
 7   beginning of the deposition going over kind of
 8   the ground rules, one thing I should have
 9   pointed out is that there may be times when I
10   ask you a question, you answer it to the best
11   of your ability and we go on, we're talking
12   about something totally different.
13       A.   Okay.
14       Q.   All of a sudden something pops into
15   your head.  You say, oh, I wish I had told
16   Larry something in addition to what I told him
17   before.  This isn't so formal that you can't
18   just say, hey, there's something that I just
19   remembered; I just want to let you know.
20       A.   Okay.  Thank you.
21       Q.   So if at any point in time we move on
22   and something pops into your head, just bring
23   it to my attention.  Okay?  If you remember a
24   name of a store or you remember names of brakes
0051
 1   or anything, just let me know.
 2       A.   Thank you.
 3       Q.   So to the best of your knowledge, have
 4   you told us about the different kinds of
 5   mechanical and maintenance and repair work that
 6   your husband would have done on cars?
 7            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
 8   Sometimes I'm just going to object to something
 9   like form.  That's just technical stuff.  You
10   feel free to answer it.  Okay.  Unless I were
11   to instruct you don't answer, then don't.  The
12   only other times you'll hear me is if I say
13   don't guess or things like that, but don't
14   worry about if I say objection, don't worry
15   about it.
16       Q.   I'm just seeing if you remember
17   anything else.  You remembered that your
18   husband did some work where he changed oil.  He
19   did change brakes, took an engine out, did some
20   muffler work on cars.  Any other types of
21   maintenance or repair work you can recall him
22   doing?
23       A.   Did you write down that he replaced
24   engines?  Did I say that?
0052
 1       Q.   I said he took the engine out,
 2   replaced engines.
 3       A.   Yes, so everything that kind of goes
 4   along with that.  He's talking the carburetor
 5   and the alternator, and I'm just like, oh, I
 6   don't know what you're talking about anymore,
 7   Dear.
 8       Q.   Okay.  When he did this work, did he
 9   tend to do it outside?
10       A.   Or in our garage.  Outside or in the
11   garage, yes.
12       Q.   And when he was doing this work, was
13   it always at one address?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Which address was that?
16       A.   Our home.
17       Q.   Where you live now?
18       A.   Correct.
19       Q.   Okay.  Any way to estimate how often
20   Mr. Collins would do work outside versus inside
21   the garage?
22            MR. DEATON:  That's an example where
23   I'd tell you not to guess, but if you can give
24   him a fair idea, then you feel free to do so,
0053
 1   Hon.
 2       A.   Inside the garage since we've had it,
 3   and that's been about 10 or 12 years.  So
 4   before that it was outside.
 5       Q.   Because there was no garage?
 6       A.   Because there was no garage.  And he
 7   would tarp it in the rain.  He was out there,
 8   yeah.  If something needed to be done, he did
 9   it.
10       Q.   Okay.  And if I were to ask you for
11   any of the type of work that Mr. Collins did,
12   whether it's an oil change or a brake change or
13   putting in an engine or doing muffler work, if
14   I were to ask you, do you know how he
15   specifically did that work, would your answer
16   be you don't know?
17       A.   I don't understand the question.
18       Q.   And again, this is another example of
19   me trying to make things go in a streamlined
20   fashion, but again, I only want what you
21   remember.
22       A.   Yeah.
23       Q.   With respect to any of the work that
24   your husband did on cars, whether it was an oil
0054
 1   change or a brake change or working on an
 2   engine or on a muffler, would you be able to
 3   tell us the process that he used to do that
 4   work?
 5       A.   No.  My daughter might be able to, but
 6   I can't.
 7       Q.   Which daughter?
 8       A.   Molly.  That's the one that he's
 9   teaching.
10       Q.   Did Molly start working with him on
11   cars recently, or does it go back a long time?
12       A.   Definitely recently.  Definitely
13   recently.  When I was at work, I don't know
14   what he showed her.
15       Q.   Okay.  Now, with respect to
16   motorcycles, can you recall what type of
17   maintenance or repair work your husband did on
18   motorcycles?
19       A.   Same.  He would to this day -- well,
20   not to this day, but before when he did work on
21   the motorcycles, he would take them down,
22   rebuild them.  He would know people that
23   couldn't fix a motorcycle, they'd bring it to
24   him, he would figure it out.  So he's done
0055
 1   everything with motorcycles.
 2       Q.   For any of the parts that your husband
 3   would purchase to work on motorcycles, do you
 4   recall the names of any of the stores where he
 5   got the parts from?
 6       A.   3A Motors.  I don't remember anything
 7   other than that.
 8       Q.   Okay.  For any of the parts that he
 9   purchased for motorcycles, any kinds of parts,
10   would you remember any brand names, trade
11   names, or manufacturers' names?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   I didn't ask you, but for the cars
14   that you can remember Mr. Collins working on,
15   just in terms of brands, you mentioned a
16   Volkswagen.  Can you remember any other brands
17   of cars that he worked on other than
18   Volkswagen?
19       A.   Porsche.  All the cars that we've
20   owned.  I've got to think what they are.
21   Audis, Kias, Saabs.  We've had a lot of cars.
22   A lot of Volkswagens.  I like Volkswagen, GTI.
23   That was new so -- that one, because we bought
24   that car new, we brought it to the dealer, but
0056
 1   mostly we buy used cars.
 2       Q.   But other than Volkswagen, Porsche,
 3   Audi, Kia, Saab, can you think of any other
 4   cars that either he's owned or the family has
 5   owned that he's worked on?
 6       A.   Did I say Mazda?
 7       Q.   You did not.
 8       A.   Mazda.  I'm sure there's more, but I'm
 9   not a motor head.  I know the car I'm driving,
10   if I'm lucky.
11       Q.   With respect to motorcycles, can you
12   recall any of the brands of motorcycles that he
13   would have worked on?
14       A.   Ducati, Norton, BMW, that's all I know
15   off the top of my head, but he's had lots of
16   motorcycles, so I can't keep track.
17       Q.   And I asked you a question about cars
18   in general.  If I were to ask you how he did
19   any of the work for cars, you told me that you
20   couldn't tell me, correct?
21       A.   Meaning I didn't know the procedure of
22   what he did?
23       Q.   Right.
24       A.   Correct.
0057
 1       Q.   If I were to ask you the same question
 2   with respect to any work that Mr. Collins did
 3   on motorcycles, would your answer be the same?
 4       A.   Correct.
 5       Q.   Now, just shifting to how Mr. Collins
 6   is doing now.  The last time that I saw him was
 7   when actually John did a videotaped deposition
 8   of him.
 9       A.   Uh-huh.
10       Q.   And he was undergoing chemotherapy and
11   he wasn't feeling very well.
12       A.   Uh-huh.
13       Q.   How has he been doing since then?
14            THE WITNESS:  When was that, John?
15            MR. DEATON:  Larry could probably give
16   you a better idea.
17       Q.   May of 2018.
18       A.   Yeah, he wasn't doing good.  So yeah,
19   I would never say this to him, so is he going
20   to read this?
21            MR. DEATON:  No, Honey.  Did you read
22   his?
23            THE WITNESS:  No.
24            MR. DEATON:  Okay.
0058
 1            THE WITNESS:  No, I didn't even know
 2   he had one to read.
 3            MR. DEATON:  He's not going to read
 4   yours, although he did get the marriage date
 5   right and all those things.
 6            THE WITNESS:  He always did.  He
 7   always knew when the anniversary date was.  He
 8   was always good about that, and my birthday.
 9       A.   But anyways, to answer your question,
10   when he had the second new chemo, was not
11   working, and then they started him on
12   immunotherapy and that just -- he ended up in
13   the hospital.
14       Q.   When do you think that was?
15       A.   That was in -- well, I'm going to say
16   June, but don't hold me to that.  I'm thinking
17   that was June.
18       Q.   And again, just give us an idea.  We
19   will get the exact dates from the medical
20   records, but I'm just trying to figure out how
21   he was doing.
22       A.   Second week in June he started
23   immunotherapy.  He was in the hospital the next
24   week.
0059
 1       Q.   Where did he go to the hospital?
 2       A.   Brigham and Women's.  And then yeah, I
 3   really thought I was losing him.  I thought
 4   this was the end because he couldn't do
 5   anything.  They put him on prednisone.
 6       Q.   How long was he in the hospital?
 7       A.   He was in the hospital, I want to say,
 8   maybe two days.  I really didn't want him in
 9   the hospital.  I felt like, you know, this is
10   where he's at.  Tell me what I need to do and
11   let's get him home.  I don't want him in here;
12   he's going to get sick.
13            So they really were working with us to
14   get him out of there to stabilize him.  And so
15   I think it was Friday afternoon, maybe Friday
16   afternoon that I brought him home on
17   prednisone.  And yeah, so the prednisone he
18   turned around, and that really did amazing
19   things for him.
20            And he unfortunately has to stay on it
21   because every time they take him off of it or
22   wean him down on it, he doesn't do well again.
23   So right now he's on a new chemo.  It's the
24   third treatment, second round.  One round is
0060
 1   two weeks on, one week off.
 2       Q.   So when you say third time, you mean
 3   this is the third different treatment he's
 4   had --
 5       A.   Well, this would be --
 6       Q.   -- of the new drug?
 7       A.   I'm sorry?
 8       Q.   I'm sure it was just me.  I wasn't
 9   sure if you meant this is like the third
10   different type of treatment he's had but the
11   beginning of it or the --
12            MR. DEATON:  You said this was his
13   second chemo, and then he went to
14   immunotherapy, so now --
15       A.   Now he's on his fourth treatment,
16   fourth new chemo.  So he started a year and a
17   half ago on the first one, and that lasted
18   quite a while.  And then they started him on a
19   new chemo drug.  That didn't work.  And then
20   they started him on the immunotherapy and that
21   didn't work.
22       Q.   Okay.
23       A.   And then the end of, I want to say,
24   August, the end of August, they were going to
0061
 1   try and do another round of immunotherapy, but
 2   his cancer was growing.  So the immunotherapy
 3   and the other chemo were not doing anything for
 4   him, so they started him on this new chemo
 5   drug.
 6       Q.   Okay.
 7       A.   And that was -- so what the new
 8   regimen is is two weeks on, so he has chemo,
 9   chemo, then he has a week off.  So that's one
10   round of the new drug.  He's on the first week
11   of the second round with the new drug.
12            And other than being on the
13   prednisone, he seems to be doing okay handling
14   the chemo.  It still knocks him on his butt,
15   but during that time -- oh, when did he lose
16   all the weight?  That was just recent.  He's
17   holding his own.
18            He still has -- his quality of life
19   isn't great right now, so his family -- we go
20   every year up to Prince Edward Island, and I
21   had cancelled it.  I said we're not going.  I
22   said -- this was in July.  I said forget it,
23   but then by the grace of God, there he was,
24   having to deal with him, and I'm like, we need
0062
 1   to do something.  We can't sit around the house
 2   anymore, so we scooted him up to PEI for, like,
 3   four days.  It takes 12 hours to get there, but
 4   anyways, it was worth it just for us to be
 5   together.
 6       Q.   Do you know how many -- so a round is
 7   the two weeks on, one week off?
 8       A.   Correct.
 9       Q.   Do you know how many rounds he's
10   supposed to have?
11       A.   I don't go that far.
12       Q.   Okay.
13       A.   I take one week with him at a time,
14   and I don't ask the doctors questions like
15   that.
16       Q.   Okay.
17       A.   He's going to be scanned in two weeks,
18   and we'll find out if it's working, and then
19   we'll go forward.  Why am I going to clutter my
20   brain up with all that if I don't even know if
21   it's doing anything for him?
22       Q.   So the point is he's receiving this
23   new course of chemotherapy.  You don't know yet
24   whether or not it's helping or not?
0063
 1       A.   Correct.
 2       Q.   But in a couple of weeks, there will
 3   be a scan, and then the doctors will talk to
 4   you about whether it's helping or not?
 5       A.   Right.
 6       Q.   Do you know if there's any course of
 7   treatment that's planned after that, or you're
 8   going to wait and see how he responds?
 9       A.   Actually, what I do know is this is
10   the last treatment for him that's been approved
11   by the FDA.  So I think that's probably why I'm
12   not asking questions.  Yeah.
13       Q.   When he kind of has the treatment and
14   then kind of gets past the symptoms that he has
15   from the chemo, kind of like when he's at his
16   best, how is he doing?
17       A.   With this new treatment, he hasn't
18   been doing well and so his doctor, his
19   oncologist, I called him on Friday.  It will be
20   a week ago tomorrow that I called him and said
21   he's not doing well.  And so he said we're
22   going back up to 40 on the prednisone.  So he
23   hasn't really -- so that, I think has helped
24   balance him a little bit with his treatment
0064
 1   that he had on Tuesday.  Plus he is just, I
 2   don't know, I'll find out Friday, Saturday how
 3   he's doing.
 4            Last week he wasn't doing good.  He
 5   couldn't eat.  So, you know, it's -- every week
 6   is a new week.  And each time he has a
 7   treatment, he comes out of it different.  So
 8   like this one hits him the day of the
 9   treatment.  The one that worked for him in the
10   beginning didn't hit him until the weekend, and
11   he's always received treatment on Tuesday.  So
12   yeah, it's just one of those things you just
13   have to wait and see how he's doing.
14       Q.   Assuming he's feeling better versus
15   his worst, does he get out?  Does he take
16   walks?  Does he exercise at all?  What does he
17   do to get out of the house?
18       A.   He'll walk around the supermarket
19   pushing a cart.  He can't just walk around.  He
20   doesn't have the energy to do that, but if he
21   pushes a cart, he can.  He will force himself
22   to do a lot of things just to keep the girls
23   and I happy, but a lot of times we'll just stay
24   in the house with him because we know we want
0065
 1   to make him happy, too, and not make him go out
 2   and do things.
 3            He knows that if he stays on the
 4   prednisone, he has to do PT to keep his legs
 5   strong because his legs get real weak.  I
 6   haven't had a normal with this new drug.  Like
 7   there has been no week that's been normal since
 8   May.  So every week it's different, and we do
 9   kind of push him a little bit to do things with
10   us.
11            MR. SUGARMAN:  Okay.  It probably
12   makes sense just to take a break.  I'm just
13   going to look over my notes.  Those may be all
14   the questions that I have for you, and then
15   some of the other attorneys may have some, but
16   we'll take a five- or ten-minute break.
17            MR. DEATON:  Okay.
18                 (Off the record, 11:11a.m.)
19                 (Back on the record, 11:35a.m.)
20                      * * * * *
21                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
22   BY MR. AGUDELO:
23       Q.   My name is Tony Agudelo, and I've got
24   some follow-up questions to ask of you.
0066
 1   Mr. Sugarman had asked you if you are aware of
 2   any asbestos exposures that your husband may
 3   have had when he worked at some of the
 4   different places that he worked in his career,
 5   and I think he may have missed a couple, so I
 6   just wanted to follow up or maybe I didn't
 7   hear.
 8            Do you know if your husband had any
 9   exposure to asbestos or worked with any
10   asbestos products when he was working at
11   Westinghouse?
12       A.   I don't know what the materials were.
13       Q.   All right.  What about when he was
14   working at W.R. Grace Chomerics, do you know if
15   he was working with any asbestos products
16   there?
17            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Asked and
18   answered.  Go ahead.
19       A.   I don't.
20       Q.   Okay.  When you first met Arthur -- or
21   do you prefer that I call him Arthur or Buck?
22       A.   Doesn't matter.
23       Q.   When you first met him, where was he
24   living?
0067
 1       A.   California.
 2       Q.   He had already moved out of the
 3   Lexington house that he grew up in, right?
 4       A.   Correct.
 5       Q.   Okay.  Had you ever visited him at
 6   that Lexington house that he grew up in?  Had
 7   you ever been in that house for any reason?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Okay.  When did you go into that
10   house?
11       A.   Just as friends we would go over there
12   and visit.  It wasn't like -- I'm not sure why
13   you're asking the question.
14       Q.   Well, I'm trying to -- let me back up.
15       A.   Okay.
16       Q.   When you first were dating him, he was
17   living in California, right?
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   Where was he living when you were
20   first dating him?
21       A.   Concord, Mass.
22       Q.   Okay.
23       A.   When I first met him, he was living in
24   California.
0068
 1       Q.   Okay.  But he had already moved out of
 2   that childhood house?
 3       A.   Correct.
 4       Q.   At some point, though, you went to
 5   that childhood house even though he wasn't
 6   living there?
 7       A.   Right, because that's when he would
 8   come home from San Diego.  Oh, Buck is home.
 9   We would all arrive at his mother's house,
10   yeah.
11       Q.   Okay.  Do you know if that home had
12   any asbestos in it?
13       A.   I don't know.
14       Q.   Were you ever there while there was
15   any repairs or modifications to the house going
16   on?
17       A.   Did I know of repairs, or was I
18   physically there?
19       Q.   Were you ever there?
20       A.   No, I was not physically there.
21       Q.   Did you know of any time when your
22   husband was doing any kind of repairs or
23   maintenance of that house?
24       A.   Actually, I need to backtrack because
0069
 1   when they put the addition on the house and we
 2   were married, yes, I was there when they put
 3   the addition on their family home.
 4       Q.   About when was that?
 5       A.   In the early '80s.
 6       Q.   All right.  Did your husband have any
 7   involvement with doing work -- with working on
 8   the addition?
 9       A.   Not that I'm aware of.  It was a
10   contractor.
11       Q.   Okay.  Have you ever seen your husband
12   do any work on that house?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Okay.  What work have you seen him do
15   on that house?
16       A.   They had a pool.  He helped his mom
17   keep the pool up.
18       Q.   All right.  Anything on the inside?
19       A.   On the inside, after his dad passed,
20   he was like the guy, the go-to guy for his mom,
21   and anything that she needed repaired or done
22   when she moved out of the home, he had to go up
23   into the attic and retrieve everything that had
24   been stored up there for all those years and,
0070
 1   you know, he was top of the house, bottom of
 2   the house, yeah.
 3       Q.   Do you know if he ever did any repairs
 4   or work on the floors or the walls?
 5       A.   That, I'm not aware of.
 6       Q.   You had testified that you did not
 7   read your husband's deposition testimony, but
 8   has he talked to you about his deposition
 9   testimony at all?
10       A.   No.
11       Q.   Did he give you any advice or
12   instructions on testifying at your deposition?
13       A.   To tell the truth.  I said, what is it
14   like?
15       Q.   You had testified earlier that your
16   husband was retiring five years before he
17   planned.  Did I hear that right?
18       A.   Correct.
19       Q.   Okay.  What was his plan before he got
20   sick?  He was going to work until what year?
21       A.   Our plan was that he would retire at
22   70, and I would retire at 65.
23       Q.   Okay.  Have you filed your 2016 and
24   2017 tax returns?
0071
 1       A.   Yes.
 2            MR. AGUDELO:  Okay.  John, I think if
 3   we could get those as a supplement, that would
 4   be terrific.
 5       Q.   Some of the friends that your husband
 6   had when he was younger back in the '70s, I
 7   want to ask you about some of them in case you
 8   know them.  Do you know a Peter Rolasavich?
 9       A.   Only when we were first dating.  He's
10   not in our life now.
11       Q.   What about a Charles Shumaker?
12       A.   Same.
13       Q.   Ken Newlins?
14       A.   Know him a little more, but haven't
15   seen him in years.  They were all at our
16   wedding.
17       Q.   Have you had any contact with him
18   since your husband got sick?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   What about a Don or Donald Smith?
21       A.   Don't know that name at all.
22       Q.   Rick Barrett?
23       A.   Yeah, good friends.  Was just at our
24   house.
0072
 1       Q.   When was he last at your house?
 2       A.   Just like two weeks ago.
 3       Q.   So you still keep in touch with him?
 4       A.   Absolutely.
 5       Q.   And the last one, Steve Core?
 6       A.   Yeah.
 7       Q.   What about him, have you had any
 8   contact with him recently?
 9       A.   Well, we haven't seen him for a while
10   either.  He retired early and so him and his
11   wife have been jetting up and down the coast.
12   And we were trying to get together with them
13   last year, but Buck was sick and we said please
14   don't come.  So our connection more has been
15   verbal, not face to face.
16       Q.   When was the last time you had any
17   verbal contact with him?
18       A.   Probably a year ago.
19       Q.   Where does Rick Barrett live?
20       A.   Colorado.
21       Q.   Do you know where in Colorado?
22       A.   It's a little teeny tiny town, and I
23   can never remember the name.  I'm sorry.
24       Q.   Do you know what it's near?
0073
 1       A.   Yeah.  I really don't know.  I've
 2   never been there.
 3       Q.   Other than seeing him a couple of
 4   weeks ago, do you keep in pretty good contact
 5   with him?
 6       A.   Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're best friends.
 7       Q.   When you say "they," you mean your
 8   husband and Rick?
 9       A.   My husband and Rick, yeah.
10       Q.   Any other good friends of your husband
11   from the '70s that I haven't named that you
12   remember?
13       A.   Dennis Morse.
14       Q.   Did your husband ever work on cars
15   with Dennis Morse or talk about working on cars
16   with him?
17       A.   That's a good question.  I'm sure they
18   have, but I don't know definitively that they
19   have.  They grew up together, and Buck was a
20   motor head from birth, I think.  So yeah, I
21   mean, they were hanging out at that point, so I
22   would imagine all those guys.
23       Q.   Okay.  And how do you spell Dennis's
24   last name?  Is it M-O-R-S-E?
0074
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   Where does he live?
 3       A.   He lives in Scituate.
 4       Q.   Do you keep in contact with him at
 5   all?
 6       A.   Uh-huh.
 7       Q.   Is that a yes?
 8       A.   I'm sorry, yes.
 9       Q.   That's okay.  Everyone does it.
10       A.   Sorry.
11       Q.   Any other close friends of his from
12   the '70s that you recall?
13       A.   Tom Zermani, Z-E-R-M-A-N-I, and he
14   lives in -- where does Tom live?  New Mexico or
15   Arizona, one of those places.
16       Q.   Have you kept in touch with Tom?
17       A.   Yeah, yes.
18       Q.   All right.  Anyone else?
19       A.   Not that I can think of.
20       Q.   Okay.  Other than this lawsuit, have
21   you or your husband ever brought a lawsuit
22   against anybody else?
23       A.   No.
24       Q.   You haven't ever sued Bradlees before?
0075
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   What about Indevus Pharmaceuticals?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   Does your husband have any health
 5   issues other than the cancer currently?
 6       A.   Currently?  No.
 7       Q.   Any new medical providers he's seen in
 8   the last six weeks -- sorry, six months?
 9       A.   Well, he has a new oncologist.
10       Q.   Who is that?
11       A.   Dr. Lathan, and I'm not sure when --
12   let's see, what month are we in?  So let's see,
13   so no, we have no new doctors because he's been
14   with Dr. Lathan probably since I don't know
15   when, when the other chemo didn't work,
16   whenever that was.  I really don't remember
17   when Dr. Lathan became his doctor.
18       Q.   Was it this year, or was it before
19   this year?
20       A.   Yes, this year.
21       Q.   Where is Dr. Lathan practicing?
22       A.   Dana-Farber.
23       Q.   Has any doctor ever told you or your
24   husband that your husband has an abdominal
0076
 1   cancer that's not mesothelioma?
 2       A.   No.
 3       Q.   One of your husband's medical records
 4   from 2017 when he was at St. Elizabeth's said
 5   that you were present for the appointment, and
 6   there was a discussion about your husband's
 7   asbestos exposure.  Do you remember that at
 8   all?
 9       A.   When was the date, please?
10       Q.   It would have been April 8 of 2017?
11       A.   Right, yes.
12       Q.   Do you remember that visit?
13       A.   Well, I remember being there with him,
14   yes.
15       Q.   Okay.  The record says that, "We
16   discussed with Mr. Collins and Mary, his wife,
17   in the presence also of his daughter the final
18   diagnosis."  Then it goes further on and at the
19   end of that paragraph it says, "He has minimal
20   asbestos exposure per his history."  Do you
21   remember any discussion about your husband's
22   asbestos exposure at that visit?
23            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  You
24   can answer.
0077
 1       A.   Okay.  When my husband was first ill
 2   and all of a sudden people are coming at us,
 3   doctors talking to me saying has your husband
 4   been exposed to asbestos?  And I'm like, I
 5   don't even know what asbestos is; how am I
 6   supposed to know if he's been exposed to it?
 7   So that's how the word first came into our
 8   vocabulary.
 9            And when we found out he had
10   mesothelioma was when he was admitted to
11   emergency at St. Elizabeth's, and they asked us
12   again, has your husband been exposed to
13   asbestos?  And we're, like, looking at them,
14   like, how would we know, what is asbestos?
15   Like, we didn't even know what asbestos was.
16       Q.   Okay.
17       A.   So it was a huge education for us.
18   And, you know, my daughter who was with us at
19   the time, the three of us are looking at each
20   other, we were just, like, blank staring each
21   other.
22            And a nurse had said, well, you know
23   where asbestos comes from, and we're like, no,
24   we don't.  And she was the one who explained to
0078
 1   us where asbestos comes from, like, it's in
 2   products.  And we were like what?  How are we
 3   supposed to know what's in it if it doesn't
 4   say.  So, yeah, that's how we started finding
 5   out about it because before that we were, like,
 6   I don't think so.
 7            So that's probably where you got the
 8   minimal.  But then once we started talking with
 9   people and it was, like, oh, my gosh, asbestos
10   is everywhere and we had no idea, no idea from
11   the powder that I'm putting on my daughter to,
12   you know, the powder that I put on my brother
13   and my siblings when I was taking care of them,
14   yeah.
15       Q.   Since those initial discussions with
16   the doctor and then the nurse that you just
17   told me about, have you had any discussions
18   with any of his other medical providers since
19   then about any asbestos exposure he's had in
20   his life?
21       A.   I don't think they care about that.
22   They were interested in a diagnosis, and to be
23   quite honest with you, that's what I was
24   interested in.  What can we do to get him
0079
 1   better, what do we need to do.
 2       Q.   Before you consulted with a lawyer,
 3   did you or your husband do any research on
 4   asbestos and where his exposures may have been?
 5       A.   No.
 6       Q.   Anybody else in your family or friends
 7   do that for you?
 8            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
 9       A.   I have no idea what friends would have
10   done and family.  I just know what we did.  Us,
11   for us and my immediate family, my girls and my
12   husband and I, it was all about what we need to
13   do to get him strong and back on his feet
14   again.  That was our goal.
15            Just like when Larry asked how many
16   more treatments, it's like, I never asked is he
17   terminal.  I never asked what stage he was.  I
18   don't want to know that because that's all
19   negative.  I just want to stay positive and
20   march forward.
21       Q.   How is your health?
22       A.   I think I'm pretty healthy.
23       Q.   You're not dealing with any serious
24   medical conditions or illnesses?
0080
 1            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.
 2       A.   No.
 3       Q.   Your husband has provided information
 4   that he had smoked cigarettes back in the
 5   1970s, from 1972 to 1978.  Do you ever remember
 6   him smoking cigarettes?
 7       A.   I don't remember his smoking because I
 8   think he was a casual smoker, but I remember
 9   when he quit.  We weren't dating.  We were all
10   just hanging out, and it was New Year's Eve.  I
11   don't remember what year.  Obviously, before I
12   was dating him.
13            So he just took like three cigarettes,
14   lit them up, and he said, that's it, no more,
15   and he put them out.  And I never saw him with
16   a cigarette again.  But I never really saw him
17   with cigarettes to begin with.
18       Q.   Do you know why he quit?
19       A.   No, never asked.  Just we were all
20   just like, whoa, go for it, Buck.
21       Q.   Did you ever have any discussions with
22   him where you urged him to quit?
23       A.   No, I wasn't dating him.  We were just
24   friends.
0081
 1       Q.   I know you said you've been focused on
 2   getting the right treatment for your husband
 3   and getting him better, but have you ever had
 4   any discussions with him generally about his
 5   exposure to asbestos during his lifetime?
 6       A.   I don't recall that we ever have, no.
 7   I can't even recall how he found out like, what
 8   was in asbestos.  So yeah, if we did, it was
 9   not eventful.
10       Q.   And none of my questions will ever ask
11   any conversations that you've had with
12   Mr. Deaton or anybody in his office or any
13   other lawyers, but before the lawsuit, before
14   consulting with any other lawyer, did you have
15   any reason to believe that your husband was
16   exposed to asbestos from any Volkswagen
17   product?
18       A.   I didn't even know there was asbestos
19   in Volkswagen products, so I don't know if I'm
20   answering your question, but I think that the
21   way I'm hearing the question is -- can you
22   repeat it because I'm not sure I'm
23   understanding what you're asking.
24       Q.   Sure, sure.  Before you had any
0082
 1   contact with a lawyer or a lawyer's office, did
 2   you have any reason to believe that there was
 3   any asbestos in Volkswagen that had contributed
 4   to causing your husband's disease?
 5            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  You
 6   can answer, if you understand.
 7       A.   I don't really understand the question
 8   because I already said that we didn't know
 9   there was asbestos in products, so I don't know
10   how to answer that question.  I'm sorry.
11       Q.   And that was before you consulted with
12   a lawyer?
13            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.
14       A.   When we were merrily living our life,
15   I had no idea there was asbestos in the
16   products that I am now aware of.  Had I known
17   they were in them, we wouldn't have used them.
18   I'll just say that.
19       Q.   Okay.  Now that you've gone through
20   this process and you've learned more, I
21   presume, about asbestos in products, do you
22   feel that you had any exposure to asbestos from
23   1990 or earlier?
24            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  You
0083
 1   can answer, if you understand.
 2       A.   Well, I know that -- I now know that
 3   there's asbestos in baby powder, and I was
 4   definitely exposed to that.  I used it every
 5   day myself, and I used it on my siblings.  It
 6   was like the -- you know, the commercials were
 7   baby powder and cute babies and I don't know.
 8   It was just the way we were raised.  It was
 9   what was there.
10            You know, it's like when you move off
11   on your own, you take the toilet paper brand,
12   you take the powder brand and you just move it
13   into your life, and that's what I did not
14   knowing what I was doing, unfortunately.
15       Q.   Other than the baby powder, any
16   sources of asbestos exposure that you believe
17   you may have had before 1990?
18            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  She
19   said she doesn't know what had asbestos in it,
20   but go ahead, answer it again.
21       A.   I think that -- I think for me it
22   would have been whatever I was around, you
23   know.  My dad did home repairs, yeah, so it
24   would be whatever -- and I don't even know.  I
0084
 1   don't know -- I can't really answer that
 2   question because I don't know what I may have
 3   been exposed to as a child living in an older
 4   home.
 5       Q.   Okay.  Was your husband ever around
 6   your dad when he was doing those home repairs?
 7       A.   Not my dad, no.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Besides yourself and your
 9   husband and your husband's mother, is there
10   anybody else, family members or friends, that
11   have any knowledge about your husband's
12   exposure to asbestos that you're aware of?
13       A.   Well, I think that if people are
14   brought into light as to what contains
15   asbestos, then I think that they would, yeah.
16   He was -- he lived in his grandfather's house
17   when he was a baby, and his grandfather was a
18   firefighter.  So, you know, there's so many
19   things that asbestos is in or was in, I'm
20   praying it's not in it anymore, but yeah,
21   there's many things that I think that he's been
22   exposed to over his life.
23       Q.   You mentioned your husband's
24   grandfather being a firefighter.  Do you
0085
 1   associate that work with any asbestos exposure?
 2       A.   Well, firefighters uniforms, I'm
 3   understanding, had asbestos in them, yeah.
 4       Q.   Any other association that you have
 5   besides their uniforms?
 6       A.   No.
 7       Q.   You and your husband have made some
 8   claims against trusts so these are usually
 9   bankrupt companies that have set up these
10   trusts where people who have current illnesses
11   can seek some compensation.  You're familiar
12   generally with that?
13       A.   Generally, yeah.
14       Q.   So I want to ask you about some of
15   those claims that you have made that your
16   counsel has provided us with.  One was to a
17   company called Congoleum, and the allegation
18   was that your husband's father used
19   asbestos-containing vinyl asbestos floor tiles.
20            Do you have any information about your
21   husband being around his father when he was
22   using asbestos-containing floor tiles?
23       A.   Well, I believe that's when they were
24   building their house.  I was not involved in
0086
 1   his life at that point, but I've seen pictures
 2   of him there, yeah.
 3       Q.   Has your husband told you anything
 4   about that work that was going on in terms of
 5   the floor tiles in that house?
 6            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.
 7       A.   No, we don't talk about that stuff.
 8   It's negative.  We just really keep things
 9   positive.  Sorry, it's just how we choose to
10   live.  We pray.  We look at the beautiful
11   foliage.  We look at the beautiful lives we've
12   had, and quite frankly, this is stressful and
13   yeah, so no, we don't talk about it.
14       Q.   And that's fine.  I'm just trying to
15   find out if there has been any discussions, if
16   you learned anything.
17       A.   It's not going to change.
18       Q.   So I imagine we'll go quickly through
19   these.
20       A.   It's not going to change his life
21   where he is today, so if it isn't going to
22   change it, I don't want to talk about it.  I
23   want to talk about what's out there, what case
24   studies are there, where are we moving forward
0087
 1   in diagnosing earlier especially since my
 2   daughters, especially my daughters, I powdered
 3   them.  It's kind of mind-boggling when you
 4   think of some of this stuff.
 5            MR. DEATON:  I mean, the trusts, if
 6   it's been turned over, it speaks for itself.
 7   Obviously, if she wasn't with him, you're
 8   asking questions that are -- she doesn't have
 9   knowledge to.
10            MR. AGUDELO:  That's all I'm trying to
11   find out if she's got any knowledge of them.
12   They were produced after we've had a chance to
13   talk to Arthur about them.
14       Q.   But I imagine this will be quick if
15   they're all the same.  There was one for a
16   product called Hercules Furnace Cement.  Do you
17   know anything about Arthur or his father using
18   Hercules Furnace Cement?
19       A.   I can't speak to that.
20       Q.   Okay.  What about products from
21   Johns-Manville, have you heard generally the
22   name of that company?
23       A.   No, I wasn't in his life then.
24       Q.   Okay.  As you go through this process,
0088
 1   you may have filled out a form or had a
 2   discussion with him where he might have said
 3   something to you --
 4            MR. DEATON:  Well, I mean, if she
 5   filled out a form that you have, you can show
 6   her that.  I mean, if she had to fill out a
 7   form -- asking her something that she wasn't
 8   with him is almost silly.
 9       Q.   Do you recall any discussions with
10   your husband about him using GM Delco drum
11   brakes?
12       A.   I didn't talk about products with him.
13       Q.   Okay.
14       A.   So I would not be able to say a
15   specific brand.
16            MR. DEATON:  That actually -- if she
17   said I did not talk about any products, that's
18   a pretty specific answer that would include any
19   product.
20       Q.   So let me just go through these
21   quickly then.  Kentile floor tiles, has that
22   ever come up with him?
23            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Asked and
24   answered.
0089
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   Bondex patching plaster?
 3            MR. DEATON:  Objection.
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   That's fine.  That's fine.
 6       A.   Okay.
 7            MR. DEATON:  I guess he doesn't
 8   understand that "any product" covers
 9   everything.
10       Q.   What about Raybestos brake pads?
11       A.   (Nodding.)
12       Q.   Any discussions with your husband
13   about that?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   All right.  Bondex all-purpose joint
16   cement?
17            MR. DEATON:  Objection.
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   Did you have any role in trying to
20   figure out other claims besides the lawsuit
21   that you or your husband could make for
22   asbestos exposure?
23       A.   No.
24       Q.   Okay.  Last couple, Gypsum Perfa-Tape
0090
 1   or gypsum compound, joint compound?
 2            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.
 3       Q.   Ever discuss that with your husband?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   And the last one Ferodo brake pads,
 6   ever discuss those with your husband?
 7            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   Do you recall having to sign any
10   documents for any claims against companies that
11   are not defendants in this case?
12       A.   Can you repeat the question?
13       Q.   Sure.  Do you recall having to sign
14   any documents for any claims against companies
15   or trusts that are not in this lawsuit?
16       A.   I don't remember, no.
17       Q.   Okay.  Have you communicated with any
18   of these trusts yourself or your husband
19   communicate with them?
20       A.   No.
21       Q.   Other than Mr. Deaton's firm and the
22   firm of Early, Lucarelli, Sweeney and Strauss,
23   have you had any other lawyers helping you with
24   the claims that you're making for the asbestos
0091
 1   exposure?
 2            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
 3   Relevance.
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Do you yourself have any experience
 6   doing car repairs or maintenance?
 7       A.   No.
 8       Q.   You leave that all up to your husband?
 9       A.   I do.
10       Q.   Were you ever around your husband when
11   he was doing work on a Volkswagen vehicle?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   How often would that happen?
14       A.   Oh, I don't know how often, but if he
15   was -- probably more when we were dating kind
16   of hanging out with him, do you need a tool.
17   And then, you know, just it was mostly like the
18   end product, like, oh, my goodness, wait until
19   you see this, whatever he was taking or
20   repairing on the car.  And he'd say this is
21   what it was supposed to look like; this is what
22   it was.
23            So whatever X is, he would show me,
24   you know, what it looked like, what the damaged
0092
 1   part was and what the good part was.
 2       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall him ever working
 3   on brakes on a Volkswagen when you were there?
 4       A.   Uh-huh.
 5       Q.   Is that a yes?
 6       A.   Yes, I'm sorry.
 7       Q.   Did that ever happen in the 1970s?
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   Okay.  What about gasket work?
10   Mr. Sugarman asked you about gaskets.  Do you
11   know if your husband was ever working on
12   gaskets on a Volkswagen in the 1970s when you
13   were present?
14       A.   Not when I was present.
15       Q.   Okay.  And what about clutch work, did
16   your husband ever work on a clutch on a
17   Volkswagen when you were present in the 1970s?
18       A.   I actually have to go back because
19   yes, in the '70s because my first car was a
20   Volkswagen and he bought it with me.  And it
21   was used and he worked on the Volkswagen for
22   me.  So yes, actually, I guess I was, realizing
23   I was dating him at that point, and that was in
24   the '70s.
0093
 1       Q.   What year was that that you got your
 2   first car?
 3       A.   I think it was about '77 or '78.
 4       Q.   Okay.  And what kind of car was it?
 5       A.   It was a Volkswagen Beetle.  I don't
 6   remember the year of it.  It was old.
 7       Q.   Did your husband buy that for you?
 8       A.   No, I bought it, but he helped me
 9   purchase it because I didn't know anything
10   about cars.  I rode my bicycle or the bus or
11   walked.  I didn't own a car.
12       Q.   Were you ever around your husband when
13   he did any brake, clutch, or gasket work on
14   that car?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Okay.  What do you remember about
17   that?
18       A.   That he would hurry up and finish.
19   No, just I was always impressed with what he
20   was capable of doing, and he would always show
21   me, like I said, this is what I took out; this
22   is what I put in.  I never got my hands dirty
23   ever thankfully.
24       Q.   Do you know where he got replacement
0094
 1   parts on the Volkswagens that he was working
 2   on, whether his or yours or anyone else's?
 3       A.   No. We were living -- where was he
 4   living?  At that point he was in Concord, so
 5   he'd go up to Nashua a lot, yeah, but I didn't
 6   go with him on those trips.
 7       Q.   When you say he would go to Nashua,
 8   would he go to Nashua --
 9       A.   For auto parts.
10       Q.   Oh, okay.  Do you know why he went to
11   Nashua?
12       A.   I don't think there was any sales tax.
13   I think he would save the money on sales tax
14   going up there.  It wasn't that far.
15       Q.   Price was a consideration for him when
16   selecting --
17       A.   No, just not paying sales tax.  He
18   lived in California.  I think he didn't like
19   paying sales taxes.
20       Q.   Do you know the names of any places in
21   Nashua that he went to?
22       A.   Not off the top of my head.
23       Q.   Okay.  Was he going to Nashua in the
24   1970s, or was that sometime later or both?
0095
 1       A.   I think it was both, actually, yeah.
 2       Q.   Did you ever go with him to Nashua to
 3   get any parts?
 4       A.   Later, not in the '70s, yes.
 5       Q.   When you went with him later, where
 6   did he go, do you know?
 7       A.   Different places.  I actually don't
 8   remember the names of them.  It wasn't
 9   important to me.  I just knew I was in a place
10   where he would buy parts for the car, and yeah,
11   so it was different places.
12       Q.   In the 1970s, did you ever go with
13   him?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   Did you ever get parts for him that he
16   used --
17       A.   No.
18       Q.   -- with any of his cars?
19       A.   No.
20            MR. DEATON:  You have to let him
21   finish, okay.
22            THE WITNESS:  Sorry.
23            MR. DEATON:  No, no, that's all right.
24       Q.   Do you know if your husband ever used
0096
 1   an air compressor in the 1970s?
 2       A.   I know he's used an air compressor.  I
 3   can't put a date on it.
 4       Q.   All right.  Do you have a sense of the
 5   decades that he was using an air compressor in?
 6       A.   No.
 7            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
 8       A.   It just seems like a general thing
 9   that goes with automotive, you know.  He has a
10   lot of stuff.
11       Q.   You and your husband have produced
12   some old photographs that show Volkswagens in
13   them.  Do any of those photographs show you in
14   them?
15       A.   I don't believe so.
16       Q.   Are you aware of any pictures of you
17   and either Arthur's Volkswagens or your
18   Volkswagens from back in the 1970s?
19       A.   Is a Thing a Volkswagen?  Who makes a
20   Thing?  That would be the only car.  Or there's
21   a Corvette.  I don't know.  There's pictures of
22   us in the vehicles, but I don't remember if
23   they're Volkswagens or not.
24       Q.   When you mentioned the Thing, did you
0097
 1   or your husband own one of those?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   Who owned it?
 4       A.   He did.
 5       Q.   Do you remember when he owned the
 6   Thing?
 7       A.   That was in -- we were married living
 8   in Littleton, so that was in the '80s.
 9       Q.   Okay.
10       A.   I'm not sure who makes that though.
11       Q.   I want to go through a list of
12   particular places who may have sold auto parts
13   in the area and see if any of these names
14   strike your memory.  Does Europa Auto Imports
15   sound familiar to you at all?
16       A.   What is it, again, please?
17       Q.   Europa, like Europe, Auto Imports near
18   the Burlington Mall?
19       A.   I don't know.  I'm sorry.
20       Q.   I'm just trying to find out if any of
21   these names sound familiar to you, and if they
22   do --
23       A.   I don't think he ever used.  Mostly he
24   would say, going to the auto parts store, Mar.
0098
 1   Okay.
 2       Q.   What about a place called M.C.
 3   Automotive, is that name familiar to you at
 4   all?
 5       A.   No.
 6       Q.   How about L. Barr Speed and Auto
 7   Supply?
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   Pass and Weiss?
10       A.   No.
11       Q.   High Performance Cars in Waltham?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Do you know if your husband ever got
14   any parts from junkyards?
15       A.   I don't know.
16       Q.   All right.  Have you heard of a place
17   called J.P. Caroll's or Caroll's Junkyard?
18       A.   Towing.  I think they tow.
19       Q.   Do you know if your husband ever got
20   any parts from there?
21       A.   I don't know.
22       Q.   If a friend of your husband were to
23   testify that your husband got many parts from
24   junkyards, would you have any reason to dispute
0099
 1   that?
 2            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.
 3       A.   No.  I have no idea what he did before
 4   I was with him.
 5       Q.   Coming down the end here.
 6       A.   Okay.  That's a lot of papers.
 7       Q.   Ms. Collins, do you have any documents
 8   that would support a contention that your
 9   husband was exposed to asbestos from a
10   Volkswagen product?
11            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
12       A.   I don't understand the question.
13       Q.   Do you have any documents that would
14   support a contention that your husband was
15   exposed to asbestos from a Volkswagen product?
16            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  It
17   assumes and ignores the fact she says she
18   doesn't know it had asbestos in it.
19       Q.   Okay.  Because when we sent requests
20   for admissions, there was a Request for
21   Admission No. 5, and I can show it to you, but
22   I've got it here.  I'll read it.  It says,
23   "Admit that you are unable to produce any
24   documents which support your contention that an
0100
 1   asbestos-containing product distributed by
 2   Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. released
 3   fibers which Arthur Collins subsequently
 4   inhaled," and your answer was, "Denied."
 5            So the denial indicates to me that you
 6   do have some documents, so I'm trying to find
 7   out if you have any documents that would
 8   support your contention that a product from
 9   Volkswagen --
10       A.   I signed it or my husband did?
11            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
12       Q.   Your attorney signed it.
13       A.   Then my husband must know.
14            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
15   Improper use.
16       Q.   You're not aware of any document that
17   indicates that a Volkswagen product that your
18   husband worked with had asbestos in it, are
19   you?
20            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
21       A.   I don't know any products that he
22   worked on had asbestos in it until we were told
23   that they had it in it.
24       Q.   Okay.
0101
 1       A.   So for me to say -- I don't have a
 2   document or a picture or anything like that.
 3   All I know is what he did.
 4       Q.   Okay.
 5       A.   And during -- so I don't know what
 6   you're looking for me to say.
 7       Q.   I'm just trying to find out, you know,
 8   what your knowledge is on the subject.
 9            MR. DEATON:  I think she's testified
10   repeatedly that she doesn't know what products
11   had asbestos in it, so therefore, if she had a
12   picture, for example, of a Volkswagen that's
13   got brakes on it and she doesn't know that the
14   brakes had asbestos, she couldn't even tell you
15   that that's a picture that supports it.  I
16   could, but she can't.
17            MR. AGUDELO:  Well, she denied -- she
18   and her husband denied that request, so I'm
19   trying to find out what the basis of the denial
20   was.
21            MR. DEATON:  Maybe read the
22   interrogatories.  Those are documents in the
23   possession of the plaintiff.  You might want to
24   look for the word "asbestos" in it, but go
0102
 1   ahead, next question.  Either that or write
 2   better requests to admit.
 3       Q.   There's another one, Ms. Collins, that
 4   asks, "Admit that you have no evidence that
 5   VWGOA or its predecessors made any express
 6   warranty to Arthur Collins concerning any
 7   brake, clutch, or gasket parts," and that one
 8   was denied.
 9            Do you have any information that
10   Volkswagen made any warranties to your husband
11   about a brake, a clutch, or a gasket part?
12            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  Calls
13   for legal answers by a lay witness.  If you
14   understand, you can answer.
15            THE WITNESS:  I don't understand what
16   he's asking me.
17       Q.   Okay.  Are you aware of anything that
18   Volkswagen put in writing about a brake, a
19   clutch, or a gasket part that your husband
20   read?
21       A.   No, I'm not aware of that.
22       Q.   Okay.  We had talked about some of
23   these other trust claims and I went over some
24   of those names.  Are you aware of any other
0103
 1   trust claims that you and your husband are
 2   going to make besides those ones that I went
 3   over?
 4            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
 5       A.   Not aware.
 6       Q.   Did you review any repair records on
 7   any of the vehicles that your husband owned?
 8       A.   Explain that a little better.
 9       Q.   Sure.  When your husband has done work
10   on cars, sometimes there are documents that get
11   associated with it.  It could be a receipt from
12   buying a part.
13       A.   Yeah.
14       Q.   It could be a manual for the part.  It
15   could be any kind of document relating to that
16   repair, or it could just be a note, I changed
17   the brakes on a Saab today.  Are you familiar
18   with any records about any of the repairs or
19   maintenance that he's done on Volkswagen cars?
20       A.   Well, not that we would have in our
21   possession now because he would keep it with
22   the car, and if he sold the car, you'd give it
23   with the car.
24       Q.   You wouldn't hold on to those?
0104
 1       A.   So I wouldn't -- no.  The better
 2   record that you can give someone when you sell
 3   a vehicle, the better it is for us as well.
 4       Q.   Okay.  And again, I'm asking because
 5   there was a denial of a request for admission
 6   that asked if you had ever reviewed any repair
 7   records and the answer was denied, so I thought
 8   that there may have been some repair records
 9   that you or your husband may have reviewed, but
10   you're not aware of any?
11            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   When you owned Volkswagens and when I
14   say "you," I mean you, Mary, not you and your
15   husband, were they registered in your name, or
16   were they registered in your husband's name?
17       A.   Pretty much all the vehicles were
18   registered in his name, probably with the
19   exception of the first one that I bought and
20   possibly the GTI, but all the other ones.  And
21   even up until recently all the vehicles, my
22   daughters' vehicles and everything because it
23   was just easier because he did everything.  He
24   registered the cars.  He got them inspected.
0105
 1   He did everything.  And yeah, so it was just
 2   easier for it to be in his name when he went to
 3   the registry.
 4       Q.   When you bought your first Volkswagen,
 5   who did you buy it from?
 6       A.   I don't have any idea.
 7       Q.   It wasn't a family friend or something
 8   like that?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   Do you know anything about the
11   maintenance or repair history of that car
12   before you owned it?
13       A.   It was a long time ago.  I don't
14   recall.  I did own a -- we did own a Super
15   Beetle as well, and we bought that from a
16   cousin, so that car we knew a lot more about.
17   That was in the '80s.
18            MR. AGUDELO:  Okay.  I think I don't
19   have any more questions.  Thank you,
20   Ms. Collins.
21            THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Thank you.
22            MR. DEATON:  Next.

24                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
0106
 1   BY MS. VELLUCCI:
 2       Q.   Good morning, Ms. Collins.  My name is
 3   Margreta Vellucci, and I have some questions
 4   for you.  I think I'll be fairly brief, but my
 5   questions are also going to focus on automotive
 6   work.  All right?
 7       A.   Uh-huh.
 8       Q.   When you were asked where parts were
 9   purchased for your husband's work on vehicles,
10   you had mentioned one store was NAPA?
11       A.   Uh-huh.
12       Q.   And those are the focus of my
13   questions.  Okay?
14       A.   Okay.
15       Q.   Did you ever go to a NAPA store or a
16   store that you associate with NAPA to purchase
17   parts?
18       A.   I do recall NAPA.  I think that was
19   one of the ones that I went to, yes.
20       Q.   Okay.  And so you believe that you
21   went to a NAPA store?
22       A.   Yeah.
23       Q.   Do you know when that would have been
24   either by if you can't give me a year, just a
0107
 1   decade or approximately how long ago it was?
 2       A.   Probably in the '80s, yeah.
 3       Q.   Did you go just during the '80s, or
 4   was that the first time that you went to that
 5   store?
 6       A.   I didn't go often with him, but it was
 7   one of -- I think I've been there a couple of
 8   times.
 9       Q.   When you went to this store, was it
10   with your husband, or did you go by yourself?
11       A.   No, it was with him.
12       Q.   Was it always with your husband?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Do you know where that store was
15   located?
16       A.   I don't remember.
17       Q.   Do you know what town it was located
18   in?
19       A.   It may have been Chelmsford, but I'm
20   not 100 percent sure.
21       Q.   Do you recall where you were living at
22   the time that you went to that store?
23       A.   Littleton.
24       Q.   Okay.
0108
 1            MR. DEATON:  I'm just going to remind
 2   you again --
 3            THE WITNESS:  Yes.
 4            MR. DEATON:  -- you qualified it and
 5   you said to Margreta that you're not sure.  As
 6   long as you're not guessing, and if you can say
 7   more than one, you don't know which one, that's
 8   fine, but just don't guess, please.
 9            THE WITNESS:  All right.
10       Q.   I just want whatever memory you have.
11   And if you don't remember, that's fine, too.
12       A.   I really don't remember.  That was a
13   guess.  Might want to scratch it.
14       Q.   So just so we're clear, when you said
15   "may have been Chelmsford," that was a guess
16   and you just don't recall?
17       A.   Right.
18       Q.   So you have no idea what city or town
19   the store you associate with NAPA was located
20   in?
21       A.   Yeah, I'm sorry.
22       Q.   That's okay.  Do you know how many
23   times you went to that store?
24       A.   The most would have been twice.
0109
 1       Q.   Okay.  Do you know what part or parts
 2   were purchased when you went there?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   Do you know for what vehicle those
 5   parts were purchased?
 6       A.   I don't recall.
 7       Q.   Are you able to describe the store for
 8   me at all?
 9       A.   I'm sorry, I can't.
10       Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me how it is that
11   you know it was associated with NAPA?
12       A.   The logo.
13       Q.   And can you describe the logo for me
14   at all?
15       A.   Of course, now I'm going to draw a
16   blank.  No, not off the top of my head, I
17   can't.
18       Q.   Okay.  Do you associate any other name
19   or names with that store?
20       A.   Just that it's an auto store.
21       Q.   Not like a Joe's NAPA or a Steve's
22   NAPA or something like that?
23       A.   Yeah, unfortunately.
24       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall the name of the
0110
 1   owner or any employees?
 2       A.   (Nodding.)
 3       Q.   No?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Do you know if the store is still
 6   there?
 7       A.   I don't know.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Do you know if your husband
 9   ever had an account at that store?
10       A.   I don't know.
11       Q.   Okay.  And do you have any documents,
12   invoices, receipts, or any paperwork from a
13   store that you associate with NAPA?
14       A.   I would have to go and look.  Off the
15   top of my head, I don't know.
16       Q.   And I just ask that if you go and look
17   and you find something, that you just don't
18   destroy it and you turn it over to your
19   attorney.  Okay?
20       A.   Okay.
21            MS. VELLUCCI:  All right.  Those are
22   all the questions I have.  Thank you.
23            MR. DEATON:  Next?
24                      * * * * *
0111
 1                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
 2   BY MS. BATCHELDER:
 3       Q.   Are you okay to continue right now,
 4   Ms. Collins?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Good afternoon.  My name is Stephanie
 7   Batchelder, and I expect to be brief, but I'm
 8   not going to promise you that.
 9       A.   Okay.
10       Q.   So you testified earlier that you and
11   your husband Arthur shared diaper changing
12   duties, correct?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   And he testified to that as well.  You
15   also testified that you kind of had the day
16   shift, so to speak, 5 a.m. to 3 p.m., while he
17   was at work?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   And when Arthur came home from work,
20   he had hobbies that he would perform, right?
21       A.   Uh-huh.
22       Q.   Such as working on cars and doing shop
23   work in the basement and things like that?
24       A.   Uh-huh.
0112
 1            MR. DEATON:  You're going to have to
 2   give verbal answers.
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   Would he perform his hobbies daily?
 5       A.   I would say yes.
 6       Q.   Okay.  About how much time a day would
 7   he spend when he got home from work performing
 8   his hobbies?
 9       A.   It varied.
10       Q.   Are you able to estimate for me?
11   Would it be about an hour, more than that?
12            MR. DEATON:  Don't guess.
13       A.   No.
14       Q.   No, you don't know?
15       A.   I don't know.
16       Q.   Okay.  What time did the kids go to
17   bed, typically?  And let me clarify that.
18   While they were in diapers, so ages newborn to
19   two to three years old.
20       A.   Thank you.  Molly was later in the
21   evening, around 10.  She was a late one.
22       Q.   10 p.m.?
23       A.   Uh-huh.  Anna was a little more
24   structured.  She was probably between 8 and 9.
0113
 1       Q.   Is Anna your oldest?
 2       A.   Youngest.
 3       Q.   I was going to say it usually happens
 4   with the oldest, right?
 5       A.   Uh-huh.
 6       Q.   Okay.  Whatever time was spent while
 7   Arthur was performing his hobbies, fair to say
 8   he was not changing diapers while he was
 9   outside working on cars, right?
10       A.   Actually, when he got home from work,
11   he wasn't working on -- he would do his hobbies
12   after the girls went to bed.  He would be
13   hanging out with them.  Like raking leaves and
14   they'd be playing in the leaves.  So if he was
15   doing work, Molly was with him.  When she was
16   an infant, he would play with her.
17            First, he would shower, get all the
18   little metal stuff off of himself, and then he
19   would play with her.  So pretty much when she
20   would go to bed is when he would go out to the
21   shed or go to the basement.
22       Q.   Okay.  Got it.  Now, with respect to
23   the use of baby powder on both girls, Arthur
24   has already provided testimony in that respect
0114
 1   so I don't want to duplicate any of that.  But
 2   he did say that he never actually purchased the
 3   product himself, the Johnson & Johnson baby
 4   powder.  Is that something you did?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   You were in charge of the shopping
 7   then?
 8       A.   Then I was, yes.
 9       Q.   From where would you purchase the
10   Johnson & Johnson baby powder?
11       A.   Well, let's see, I shopped at -- with
12   products like that I would go to Walmart or
13   Donelan's.  I didn't really shop at Market
14   Basket, but occasionally I would.  So it was
15   Walmart for paper goods because I would go to
16   Nashua and save on tax.  Nashua is 15 minutes
17   away, so I would save all my household items
18   and buy them all at one time.
19       Q.   Okay.  So the Walmart was in Nashua?
20       A.   No.  It was actually in Hudson, so
21   we'd bulk buy.  We'd load up on paper towels,
22   diapers, powder, TP, all that kind of stuff,
23   tissues.
24       Q.   Right.  Do you know where the Walmart
0115
 1   in Hudson is located?  Do you have a street?
 2       A.   No, it's still there.
 3       Q.   And you mentioned Donelan's?
 4       A.   Littleton.
 5       Q.   In Littleton?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   And you recall purchasing Johnson &
 8   Johnson baby powder from there as well?
 9       A.   Uh-huh.
10       Q.   Do you have a street address for that
11   location?
12       A.   Not off the top of my head.
13       Q.   Do you know if it still exists today?
14       A.   Yes, yeah.
15       Q.   And Market Basket, which Market Basket
16   did you shop at?
17       A.   In Westford.
18       Q.   Do you know where in Westford?
19       A.   Well, they've moved.  They're on --
20   Littleton Road still, but their original
21   location has moved.
22       Q.   Now, when purchasing Johnson & Johnson
23   baby powder, did you have a specific size of a
24   bottle that you would purchase?
0116
 1       A.   Well, it varied, depending on what I
 2   needed it for.
 3       Q.   Okay.
 4       A.   Because I would -- so I'd have a
 5   larger one in the changing table, but then I
 6   would have smaller ones in the diaper bag, the
 7   beach bag.  A larger one on my dresser.  So
 8   there were varied sizes depending on where I
 9   had them.
10       Q.   Sure.  Are you able to tell me how
11   many ounces approximately the larger bottle
12   was?
13       A.   No.
14       Q.   How about the smaller bottle?
15       A.   No, I have no idea.
16       Q.   The smaller bottle, would you consider
17   a travel-size bottle or larger than that?
18       A.   Probably a little larger.  I'm not
19   sure what a travel-size one looks like.
20       Q.   Okay.  And you said you would keep the
21   bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder in
22   different locations?
23       A.   Yeah.
24       Q.   So you would have multiple containers
0117
 1   around the house at any given time?
 2       A.   Correct.
 3       Q.   Okay.  How many bottles of Johnson &
 4   Johnson baby powder would you make at any given
 5   purchase?
 6       A.   When I bulk bought.
 7       Q.   So the Walmart shopping?
 8       A.   Yeah.
 9       Q.   Okay.
10       A.   So I would buy a couple, leave one on
11   the shelf, that kind of thing.
12       Q.   Sure.  And if you weren't using the
13   Johnson & Johnson -- strike that.
14            So you have two girls?
15       A.   Uh-huh.
16       Q.   Expert at changing diapers, I suppose?
17       A.   Not from the girls.  From my siblings.
18       Q.   Fair to say you changed them anywhere
19   around the house?
20       A.   Mostly on the changing table, but
21   yeah.
22       Q.   If you had to change them on the bed,
23   you'd change them on the bed?
24       A.   Yeah, yeah.
0118
 1       Q.   On the couch sometimes?
 2       A.   Maybe.
 3       Q.   On the floor even?
 4       A.   Yeah.
 5       Q.   Back of the car maybe?
 6       A.   Back of the car definitely.  That was
 7   a given.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Who was responsible for
 9   cleaning the house?
10       A.   Me.
11       Q.   How often would you clean?
12       A.   It varied.  It varied.  Sometimes it
13   was once a week.  Sometimes it was once a
14   month.  Sometimes my father would show up and
15   go, Mar, time for a party.  So it varied on
16   depending on what our life was.
17       Q.   Fair to say you could go weeks at a
18   time without cleaning?
19       A.   Fair to say.
20       Q.   Okay.  Now, I believe you have
21   answered interrogatories in this case?
22       A.   What does that mean?
23       Q.   You've answered discovery in this
24   case?
0119
 1       A.   I don't understand what you're asking
 2   me.
 3       Q.   Strike the question.
 4       A.   I have never done anything like this
 5   before, so I have no idea what you're asking.
 6       Q.   Do you and your husband vacation?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   Did you vacation to Prince Edward
 9   Island?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   And did you vacation to Lake
12   Winnipesaukee?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Are there any other places that you
15   and your family vacationed while the kids were
16   in diapers?
17       A.   While they were in diapers, man,
18   probably -- not that I can say off the top of
19   my head.
20       Q.   Okay.
21       A.   But I don't think we were restrictive
22   to those two areas.  Definitely those two areas
23   are prime places.  We go there all the time.
24       Q.   Okay.  How many vacations did your
0120
 1   family typically take in a year?
 2       A.   When the girls were little?
 3       Q.   Yes, let's start there.
 4       A.   When they were in diapers?
 5       Q.   Yes, start when they were in diapers?
 6       A.   Probably twice a year.
 7       Q.   Okay.  And would you pack the baby
 8   powder to bring with you?
 9       A.   Uh-huh.
10            MR. DEATON:  You have to answer yes.
11       A.   It was already in the travel bag.
12       Q.   Did you ever pack the baby powder with
13   any other cosmetic products?
14       A.   For the baby?  Meaning like Desitin?
15       Q.   Do you wear cosmetic products?
16       A.   Mascara.
17       Q.   You don't wear any powder?
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   Did you?
20       A.   No.
21       Q.   You've never worn any powder?
22       A.   Maybe in my 20s, but not as a mom.
23   Did not have time.  I don't even think I wore
24   mascara.
0121
 1       Q.   Did you ever use any foot powder?
 2       A.   Not foot powder, but I used baby
 3   powder on myself.
 4       Q.   On yourself?
 5       A.   Yeah, after I showered, and deodorant,
 6   so that was the extent of mommyhood, yeah.
 7       Q.   Okay.  So let's take vacations now
 8   after the girls were in diapers.
 9       A.   Okay.
10       Q.   Where else have you guys traveled
11   together?
12       A.   Disney World.  We've gone to
13   California.  We've gone to Maryland.
14       Q.   Anywhere outside of the country?
15       A.   Connecticut.  Europe.
16       Q.   Where in Europe?
17       A.   Germany.
18       Q.   Okay.  Where in Germany?
19       A.   Let's see, where did we go?  We were
20   all over.  We were in Austria.  We were
21   traveling all over Germany.
22       Q.   How long were you in Germany for?
23       A.   Maybe two weeks.  Something like that.
24   I don't remember.
0122
 1       Q.   Do you recall when that trip was
 2   taken?
 3       A.   Four years ago.
 4       Q.   Oh, so recently?
 5       A.   Yeah.
 6       Q.   Any other vacations outside the
 7   country?
 8       A.   Just Canada.  We go there all the
 9   time.  Every year.
10       Q.   And how long would you stay?
11       A.   Varied from a week to two weeks,
12   depending on how much time we had to take off.
13       Q.   And when was the first time you and
14   Arthur visited -- that was Prince Edward
15   Island?
16       A.   Correct.
17       Q.   When was the first time you and Arthur
18   visited together?
19       A.   25 years ago.
20       Q.   Okay.  And you went there annually
21   until when?
22       A.   Until this summer.  There might have
23   been one year here and there depending on life
24   circumstances that we didn't get there, but for
0123
 1   the most part, it was every year.
 2            MS. BATCHELDER:  Okay.  I believe
 3   those are all my questions.  Thank you for your
 4   time.
 5            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.
 6            MR. DEATON:  Anyone else have
 7   questions in the room?
 8                 (No response.)
 9            MR. DEATON:  Negative response.
10            Anyone have questions on the phone?
11                 (No response.)
12            MR. DEATON:  Negative response.
13            We're going to take a ten-minute
14   break.
15                 (Off the record, 12:36p.m.)
16                 (Back on the record, 1:00p.m.)

18                EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
19   BY MR. DEATON:
20       Q.   Ms. Collins, prior to coming to this
21   deposition and answering the defense attorneys'
22   questions, other than talking to me about the
23   nature of the deposition, did you do anything
24   else to prepare for this?
0124
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   Were you shown any photographs of any
 3   nature?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Were you shown any pictures or
 6   documents?
 7       A.   No.
 8       Q.   In your husband's deposition, there
 9   was some exhibits that were marked as part of
10   his deposition.  Did you review them prior to
11   coming here this morning?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Okay.  And did I ask you to bring
14   anything today?
15       A.   No.
16       Q.   When you met me this morning when I
17   picked you up to bring you to the deposition,
18   did you bring something to me though?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Do you have it on you?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   Okay.
23            MR. DEATON:  And for the record, this
24   is a plastic container, net weight 4 ounces, of
0125
 1   Johnson's baby powder.
 2       Q.   And why did you bring this to me this
 3   morning?
 4       A.   Well, because I noticed it had talcum
 5   powder in it, so I was concerned does that mean
 6   there's no asbestos, you know, because it never
 7   was stated that there was asbestos in the
 8   powder before, so should I get rid of that, or
 9   are they making it now that doesn't have
10   asbestos in it?  So I was concerned about
11   having -- this was in my beach bag.
12       Q.   Okay.  And you had already talked
13   about carrying smaller -- would you consider
14   this a travel size?  I don't know when the
15   attorney asked you travel size?
16       A.   It is.
17       Q.   From your perspective?
18       A.   Yeah.
19       Q.   Okay.  And I understand that's why you
20   brought it to me.  My question is, so that we
21   can be clear, do you know how old this
22   particular bottle is?
23       A.   No.
24       Q.   And I don't want you to guess for my
0126
 1   questions either.  Do you think it's within ten
 2   years of purchasing it, or you just honestly
 3   don't know?
 4            MR. SEXTON:  Objection.  Asked and
 5   answered.
 6       Q.   You can avoid him.
 7       A.   I think it's within ten years.
 8       Q.   You think it's within ten years?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   Okay.  Can you say anything more
11   specific than that?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Now, I just happen -- on the back here
14   in answering it, you said that you had looked
15   at the ingredients.  What does the ingredients
16   say?
17       A.   It says talc and fragrance.
18       Q.   So the only two ingredients listed on
19   this bottle, regardless of when it was
20   manufactured, is talc and fragrance?
21       A.   Correct.
22       Q.   All right.  Now, also on the back,
23   just out of curiosity, I've never seen this
24   until today, interesting it has -- before the
0127
 1   label ingredients, in caps, capitalization,
 2   there's another category.  Do you see what that
 3   category says?
 4       A.   "Warning."
 5       Q.   Okay.  And then it lists --
 6       A.   I can't read it.
 7       Q.   That's fine.  It discusses some
 8   warning related to keep out of reach of
 9   children and whatnot, right?
10       A.   Okay.
11       Q.   You don't see "asbestos" or anything
12   like that?
13       A.   Let me get my glasses.  No.
14       Q.   Okay.  I guess what I'm saying is back
15   when you were buying the Johnson & Johnson
16   products, do you know whether it had a warning
17   of any type on it?
18       A.   I'm not aware of it.
19       Q.   Or you can't recall?
20       A.   I can't recall.
21       Q.   But clearly, there's the ability, as
22   we see here, for a warning to be placed on it?
23       A.   Uh-huh.
24       Q.   Okay.  And there's an ability for it
0128
 1   to tell you the ingredients that are in it,
 2   right?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   In fact, there's only two ingredients
 5   in this one?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   Okay.  Were the Johnson & Johnson baby
 8   powder that you've testified to, did it come in
 9   different sizes than this 4-ounce one?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   And did it come in different packaging
12   and appearances than this one through the
13   years?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Okay.  I'll show you then an exhibit
16   that was marked as Exhibit 4 at your husband's.
17   I'll mark this as Exhibit 1 for yours.
18                 (Exhibit 1, Three-page document
19                 of advertisements, so marked.)
20       Q.   And I'll just ask you, it's a
21   three-page exhibit now, and you had mentioned
22   advertising earlier in your testimony, right?
23       A.   Yeah.
24       Q.   That you had seen for Johnson &
0129
 1   Johnson?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   I'm just asking you, the baby --
 4   Johnson & Johnson baby powder product that's
 5   depicted in these three photographs that
 6   comprise Exhibit 1, are they similar to the
 7   type of packaging you saw throughout the years?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Now, a couple other follow-ups.  What
10   we'll do, just for the record, since we used
11   it, it's appropriate, I will put a sticker --
12   I'm assuming that we're going to take
13   possession of this.  Okay?
14       A.   Sure.
15       Q.   What I'm going to have you do though
16   is -- it was at your house?
17       A.   Correct.
18       Q.   And you gave it to me.  I'm going to
19   give it back to you, but I'm going to give you
20   a FedEx, my FedEx account number, and I'm going
21   to have you FedEx it to my office so that we
22   have what's called a chain of custody in check,
23   but until then, I'm going to have you maintain
24   possession.  Okay?
0130
 1       A.   Okay.
 2       Q.   But we will mark it as Exhibit 2.
 3   I'll leave it there.
 4                 (Exhibit 2, Bottle of Powder, so
 5                 marked.)
 6       Q.   Now, a couple of follow-ups, ma'am,
 7   and I'll be quick.  You said something that
 8   wasn't followed up on about Molly.  And you
 9   said, quote, Molly is putting her life on hold
10   to be with us, and you got a little emotional.
11   And I don't mean to do it, but if you could
12   explain a little more what you meant by that.
13       A.   Well, she has a desire to go across
14   the pond to work.  She's been to Hong Kong.
15   She's been to Germany.  She has a desire to
16   teach English as a second language, and she's
17   volunteering doing that in the States, but
18   that's -- yeah.
19            So anyways, she's an animator.  That's
20   what her degree is in is animation.  There's
21   not a lot of work around here for animators.
22   And she was looking down in North Carolina and
23   pretty much let those leads go when her dad got
24   sick.
0131
 1       Q.   I would imagine teaching English as a
 2   second language in a foreign country is more of
 3   the desired path that she wanted to take as
 4   opposed to here; is that fair to say?
 5       A.   That's fair to say, yes.
 6       Q.   And you said that she's put all those
 7   things on hold when her dad got sick.  How long
 8   has that been that she's had it placed on hold?
 9       A.   About two years.
10       Q.   And is that something that Buck is
11   aware of?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   If he was aware of it, how would that
14   make him feel?
15       A.   It's not what he would want.
16       Q.   He'd want her to live her life?
17       A.   Yeah.
18       Q.   All right.
19       A.   But it's her choice.  That's the way
20   we've raised our girls.  It's like, here are
21   the facts.  Make your decision, and yeah.
22       Q.   And you also talked about Anna, and
23   Anna comes home a lot on the weekends?
24       A.   Yeah.
0132
 1       Q.   Why is that?
 2       A.   To spend time with her dad.
 3       Q.   Is Anna the one that he was sitting in
 4   the chair trying to sort of teach her a little
 5   bit about the mechanics?
 6       A.   No, that was Molly.
 7       Q.   That was Molly?
 8       A.   Yeah.
 9       Q.   And did he talk to you about -- from
10   your perspective being his wife, when you see
11   your husband that you describe as someone as
12   very active sitting in the chair doing that,
13   what impact does it have on you?  We're going
14   to be over this quick.
15       A.   It's not good.  To have been married
16   to him for as long as I have and know that
17   that's not who he is, and to come home and see
18   him in the same place that he was in when I
19   left is -- it's hard.  It's hard to see him not
20   get up and do things that he likes to do.
21            He's got a ton of projects, you know,
22   and they're just sitting there and he can't do
23   anything.  He has to, you know, we had to close
24   the pool this weekend, and I'm like, okay, what
0133
 1   do I need to do.  And just for him to come out
 2   and stand and give instructions, he couldn't do
 3   that.  He's like I can't do this.  I've got to
 4   go sit back down because he gets very fatigued
 5   in his shoulders.  He can't hold himself up
 6   because he lost so much weight.
 7       Q.   And do you see the impact that has on
 8   him?
 9       A.   Yes, because he always did that.  I'm
10   like, how the heck did he do this by himself?
11   He just always took care of us.  And we'd be
12   like Dad, or Buck, whatever, what can we help
13   you with?  And he's like no, no, I've got it,
14   I've got it, and we'd watch him put the balloon
15   in and cook dinner or whatever we were doing.
16   Whatever we did was together.  And moments like
17   that, you know, closing up the pool or opening
18   it.
19       Q.   Now, you just said, too, that he
20   cooked dinner.  So he works a day, and you said
21   that when he came home, that was his time with
22   the girls?
23       A.   Right.
24       Q.   And was he a true partner for you in
0134
 1   that sense where he cooked?
 2       A.   Yeah, our roles have changed over the
 3   years as the girls got older and more
 4   independent.  He always liked to cook, and in
 5   the beginning I didn't.  It was something that
 6   I had to do as a member of a family of ten.  So
 7   when I was off on my own, it was like not
 8   something I enjoyed.  He liked to cook.
 9            But then when we had our family, our
10   roles changed.  I cooked.  But now that they're
11   older, he cooks.  I'm usually at work and would
12   come home and there's dinner on a plate for me
13   if I get home at, like, 8 or something, but
14   he's already eaten with the girls and, you
15   know, it's just he can't do any of that anymore
16   and it's sad.
17       Q.   And I'm going to save most of my
18   questions for the trial but at Metal Spinners,
19   you said that he would actually work on the
20   equipment so the bosses didn't have to call the
21   manufacturer?
22       A.   Yeah.
23       Q.   Did he have a good reputation at work?
24       A.   Absolutely.  Every -- my niece's
0135
 1   husband works there.  Buck referred him in.
 2   And he comes home and he's like, man, everyone
 3   loves Buck.  He does this; he does that.  Oh,
 4   Buck did that.  And it's just like that's
 5   always been the nature of that job is he just
 6   is a real easy guy for people to like.
 7            And if something needed to be done, he
 8   was capable of fixing it and never -- he was
 9   never the guy that said, oh, this isn't my job.
10   He'd go, hey, oh, let me get in there and see
11   if I can fix it.
12       Q.   Right.
13       A.   So yeah, he was well liked by
14   everybody.
15       Q.   Now, you said that -- well, he
16   testified that he was working when he could
17   twice a week even though he had his diagnosis?
18       A.   Yeah.
19       Q.   And he discussed about trying to
20   maintain insurance?
21       A.   That's why I asked him if he could
22   still do that because I didn't want to lose the
23   insurance because they were covering most of
24   the bills.
0136
 1       Q.   Okay.  Now, you say most of the bills.
 2   Are you aware whether they are covering all of
 3   the bills associated with his care and
 4   treatment?
 5       A.   Un-unh.
 6       Q.   Have you received bills that are
 7   significant?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   Do you have one in mind recently?
10       A.   There was one for --
11       Q.   We're almost done.
12       A.   There was one for 62,000 dollars.
13       Q.   Now, is that something that not only
14   you but that weighs on Buck's mind?
15       A.   I don't show him those.
16       Q.   You don't?  Why don't you show him?
17       A.   I think he might know about that one
18   because I was really upset, but most of the
19   bills, no, because we don't have the money to
20   pay them.
21       Q.   Why are you bearing all that stress?
22   Why are you not showing him?
23       A.   Because I don't want him to get
24   sicker.  I don't want him to feel like he needs
0137
 1   to go do more when he can't.  And he worked
 2   those days because I asked him to to keep the
 3   insurance, so now --
 4       Q.   Does that weigh on you that you asked
 5   him?
 6       A.   Yeah.
 7       Q.   And did he work as long as he could?
 8       A.   As long as he could.  So now I have my
 9   insurance through my work.  We pay for my
10   daughter's insurance through her school, and
11   we're paying COBRA for him so that he can stay
12   on that insurance because it is the best of my
13   insurance and his insurance.
14       Q.   His inability to work now, has that --
15   aside from the emotional stress and his
16   inability to physically do things, has it had a
17   financial impact on your family?
18       A.   Yeah, heavy.  He's sold --
19       Q.   I'm sorry?
20       A.   He sold his retirement car, which was
21   his Porsche so that we could pay bills.  I'm
22   like, get rid of the van; save the Porsche.  I
23   want you to enjoy that.
24       Q.   Again, I'm going to end this so that
0138
 1   you can go about your day and save a lot of my
 2   questions of this nature at the time of the
 3   trial if there is one.  Okay?
 4       A.   Okay.
 5       Q.   But you had said that in answering
 6   Mr. Sugarman's questions that you don't ask a
 7   lot of questions of the doctors.
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   At least that's what I interpreted you
10   to say.  For example, have you asked the doctor
11   what is Buck's life expectancy?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Why?
14       A.   Because I don't want to know.  I want
15   to live, this is the day, and I don't think
16   they can tell me really, to be honest with you,
17   so why would I want them to give me something,
18   you know, just a fictitious number, and it's
19   like having to go back to work and it's like
20   forget the work, honey, just retire.  It took
21   something off his plate.
22            And I feel like if they said, oh, you
23   have three months to live, especially when we
24   found out -- I don't know if I told you this or
0139
 1   not, but --
 2       Q.   It's okay, tell me now.
 3       A.   His first oncologist had fellows in
 4   seeing us about six months after he started
 5   visiting with him, and he looked at the fellows
 6   and he said, I've never said this to Mary and
 7   Buck before.  So my husband and I are looking
 8   at each other like, oh, crumbs, what's
 9   happening here.  He said, I never thought he
10   was going to make it to his first appointment,
11   his first treatment.
12            And so that was like -- that actually
13   made us feel real good because it was like, oh,
14   yeah, we're glad that he never said that to us
15   because if he had said that, that's a negative.
16   And I believe that sick people -- well, we all
17   need it anyways, but particularly sick people
18   need to be fed positive, and that wasn't
19   positive and the doctor knew that, and he was
20   always about that, too.  So yeah, I don't know
21   if I answered your question.
22       Q.   No, but finally, I think that you've
23   already experienced what it's like because I
24   think you said that when he went to the
0140
 1   hospital for the couple days, I think your
 2   words were "I thought I was losing him"?
 3       A.   Yeah, that was recent.
 4       Q.   Right.  And I would imagine that
 5   wasn't a very pleasant way to live?
 6       A.   No, every day.
 7       Q.   And is the reason why you don't ask
 8   those prognosis questions, those life
 9   expectancy questions is so you don't experience
10   the kind of life that you did when you thought
11   you were losing him on a daily basis?
12       A.   Right.  And I do believe in the power
13   of prayer, and we pray every day for a miracle.
14   We feel like we're doing everything humanly
15   possible getting him the best care, talking to
16   the doctor -- one thing I do talk to the
17   doctors about is I do look at clinical trials
18   that are out there and we talk about those
19   because this is the last treatment that's
20   available for him and only 20 percent of the
21   people respond to it.  And it's like, even
22   knowing that, it's like, ugh, I wish I didn't
23   know that.
24            And so, you know, it's just like,
0141
 1   okay, what's next.  And then we stay hopeful
 2   like, well, we don't know what God is doing,
 3   and we just always hope for another day,
 4   another good day.
 5            MR. DEATON:  Okay.  Those are all the
 6   questions I have.  Anyone have any questions?
 7            MS. BATCHELDER:  I have some
 8   follow-up.
 9                      * * * * *
10                 EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
11   BY MS. BATCHELDER:
12       Q.   Good afternoon, Ms. Collins.
13       A.   Good afternoon.
14       Q.   Are you okay to continue just for a
15   few minutes?
16       A.   Yeah.
17       Q.   Okay.  I'd like to ask you some
18   questions about the photos of Johnson & Johnson
19   advertisements that have been marked as Exhibit
20   1 to this deposition.
21       A.   Uh-huh.
22       Q.   Prior to today, had you ever seen
23   these before?
24       A.   No.
0142
 1       Q.   I'm looking at them.  I don't see a
 2   date.  Do you see a date on them at all?
 3       A.   I don't.
 4       Q.   Just so the record is clear, you're
 5   looking at all three pages, right?
 6       A.   Yeah.
 7       Q.   And what years were your daughters
 8   born, ma'am?
 9       A.   Molly is '88, and Anna is '96.
10       Q.   *Okay.  And so fair to say, if those
11   advertisements are not from either the late
12   1980s or 1990s, those would not be
13   representative of the Johnson & Johnson baby
14   powder used on either Molly or Anna, correct?
15            MR. DEATON:  Objection.  Form.  You
16   can answer.
17       A.   What was the question again?
18            MS. BATCHELDER:  Can you read it back,
19   please.
20                 (*Testimony read back by
21                 reporter.)
22            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.  You
23   can answer, if you understand.
24       A.   I'm not sure how to answer that
0143
 1   question because to think back to when Molly --
 2   when I was using the product for Molly, yeah, I
 3   don't remember.
 4       Q.   You have the baby powder that you
 5   brought with you today and you'll see that's in
 6   a plastic bottle with a circular top where you
 7   can pour it out.
 8       A.   Yeah.
 9       Q.   Do you recall the powder ever being in
10   anything but a plastic bottle?
11       A.   Do I recall the powder being in
12   anything but a plastic bottle?
13       Q.   Yes.
14       A.   Most recent, yes.
15       Q.   Back in the 1980s, do you know?
16       A.   I don't remember.  I've used the
17   product for a long time.
18       Q.   Just focusing on the time with your
19   daughters though.
20       A.   I don't recall.
21       Q.   Do you recall ever using a metal
22   container which appears to be depicted in the
23   photographs on your daughters?
24       A.   That, I don't know.
0144
 1       Q.   Okay.  And now this product that you
 2   brought with you, you said that you believe it
 3   was purchased within the last ten years; is
 4   that right?
 5       A.   I think so, yes.
 6       Q.   Okay.  Why would you have purchased
 7   Johnson & Johnson baby powder within the last
 8   ten years?
 9       A.   Because I use it at the beach.
10       Q.   On yourself?
11       A.   Oh, on all of us.  Our funny thing is,
12   oh, Mom loves powder and that's our go-to
13   because it gets the sand right off of wherever
14   it is.
15       Q.   Okay.  So do you still to this day
16   apply Johnson & Johnson baby powder to your
17   children?
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   Okay.  So you would hand the bottle to
20   them to put on them, correct?
21       A.   When we were younger -- as they got
22   older, yes, this was passed around.  And it's
23   like, wait, there's not that much left.
24       Q.   So within the last ten years, you
0145
 1   wouldn't be applying Johnson & Johnson baby
 2   powder on your children, right?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   And within the last ten years, your
 5   husband wouldn't be applying Johnson & Johnson
 6   baby powder on your children, correct?
 7       A.   Correct.  I'm just trying to think of
 8   how old Anna was, but in ten years, she would
 9   have been 12 so no, I wasn't --
10       Q.   I'm focusing on this bottle that you
11   have with you.
12       A.   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
13       Q.   Prior to today, have any of your
14   husband's doctors told you that his
15   mesothelioma could have been caused by his use
16   of talcum powder?
17       A.   To this day, no doctor has said
18   anything about that.
19       Q.   Have you asked about what the
20   potential cause of his diagnosis is?
21       A.   No.  Well, they say asbestos.
22       Q.   Right.
23       A.   Right.
24       Q.   So fair to say, no one has told you
0146
 1   that his use of Johnson & Johnson baby powder
 2   contributed to the development of his
 3   mesothelioma, correct?
 4            MR. DEATON:  Objection to form.
 5       A.   To this day?  None of his doctors
 6   have?
 7       Q.   That's my question.
 8       A.   No, I don't think they have.
 9       Q.   Okay.
10       A.   The only doctor that ever questioned
11   him being around asbestos was his primary, and
12   that's when they were trying to figure out what
13   was wrong with him.
14       Q.   And during that discussion, there was
15   nothing regarding his use of talcum powder
16   raised, correct?
17       A.   I don't remember.  Honestly, I don't
18   remember.
19       Q.   *Okay.  And I know that you were
20   generally asked about research.  Have you done
21   any research as to whether or not Johnson &
22   Johnson baby powder is contaminated with
23   asbestos-containing talc?
24       A.   I'm sorry, can you say that again?
0147
 1            MS. BATCHELDER:  Can you read it back,
 2   please?
 3                 (*Testimony read back by
 4                 reporter.)
 5       A.   I have not done any research on that.
 6       Q.   Do you know whether or not your
 7   daughters have done any research on that?
 8       A.   I don't know.
 9            MS. BATCHELDER:  Okay.  I don't have
10   any further questions.
11            THE WITNESS:  Okay.
12            MR. DEATON:  Anyone else?
13                 (No response.)
14                      * * * * *
15                EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
16   BY MR. DEATON:
17       Q.   I have a couple of follow-up
18   questions.  People keep asking you about the
19   doctors.  They said that your husband has
20   mesothelioma.  You said a doctor said it was
21   caused by asbestos, right?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   Okay.  But that doctor didn't start
24   listing products, did he?
0148
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   Do you know whether or not that doctor
 3   knows what products had asbestos?
 4       A.   I don't know.
 5       Q.   For example, you were asked questions
 6   about at some point there was discussion about
 7   minimum asbestos exposure; do you remember
 8   that?
 9       A.   Uh-huh.
10       Q.   If you were asked here today were you
11   exposed to asbestos and list every product that
12   you think contained asbestos, would you be able
13   to do that?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   Are you aware before Buck got sick
16   that there was even an issue whether or not
17   Johnson & Johnson baby powder had asbestos?
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   Were you aware before Buck got sick
20   that brakes on cars might have asbestos?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   Were you aware that clutches --
23       A.   No.
24       Q.   Were you aware that gaskets in
0149
 1   automotive --
 2       A.   No.
 3       Q.   When you talked about Buck doing
 4   muffler work, were you aware before Buck got
 5   sick that gaskets associated with mufflers in
 6   the '70s and '80s and earlier had asbestos?
 7       A.   No.
 8       Q.   Were you aware that sheetrock had
 9   asbestos?
10       A.   No.
11       Q.   Joint compound?
12       A.   (Nodding.)
13       Q.   Ceiling tiles?  Floor tiles?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   You didn't know any of that, did you?
16       A.   No.
17       Q.   You didn't know any of that because no
18   one told you that, right?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   So if Johnson & Johnson had asbestos
21   in it, they could have put it in the
22   ingredients just like they did here, couldn't
23   they?
24            MS. BATCHELDER:  Objection.
0150
 1       A.   Right.
 2       Q.   They could have also put a warning
 3   about asbestos just like they put a warning
 4   about keeping it out of the eyes of children?
 5            MS. BATCHELDER:  Objection.
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   But they didn't, did they?
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   Would that have made a difference in
10   your life, ma'am?
11       A.   Yeah.
12            MR. DEATON:  No further questions.
13   We're done.
14                 (Off the record, 1:28 p.m.)
15                 (Back on the record, 1:30 p.m.)
16                      * * * * *
17                EXAMINATION CONTINUING
18   BY MR. DEATON:
19       Q.   This is John Deaton.  Before we end
20   the deposition, I just want to ask you a couple
21   of questions to make it clear, Ms. Collins.
22            This morning you brought a container
23   of Johnson & Johnson baby powder that we marked
24   as Exhibit 2.
0151
 1       A.   Correct.
 2       Q.   That's the first time you ever showed
 3   it to me?
 4       A.   Correct.
 5       Q.   And you kept possession of it until
 6   here today?
 7       A.   That's correct.
 8       Q.   And the first time you pulled it out
 9   was actually on the record here?
10       A.   That's correct.
11       Q.   Okay.  And you had maintained
12   possession of that at your home?
13       A.   Correct.
14       Q.   Okay.
15            MR. DEATON:  So for the record, what I
16   was going to do is have my client FedEx it to
17   my office then have it tested for chain of
18   custody, but defense counsel has graciously
19   agreed that she will take possession of it and
20   send it to my office for testing at which point
21   I will give her the results of my testing.
22            And if those tests are negative, then
23   I will stipulate that they're negative in the
24   record.  If, for some reason, they come back
0152
 1   positive, I then, of course, will forward it
 2   for testing to be conducted by her experts.  Is
 3   that fair?
 4            MS. BATCHELDER:  Agreed.
 5                 (Whereupon, the deposition was
 6                 concluded at 1:31p.m.)

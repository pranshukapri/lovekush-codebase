17  BY MR. LAVIN:  

18      Q.  Doctor, would you please introduce yourself 

19  to the jury?

20      A.  My name is Sachin Dheer.  I'm a diagnostic 

21  radiologist with training in orthopedic imaging.

22      Q.  Thank you, Dr. Dheer.  Would you please tell 

23  us what kind of medicine you practice?

24      A.  I'm a diagnostic radiologist, Board 


                                                               7

 1  certified, and I have subspecialty or further 

 2  fellowship training in orthopedic imaging.

 3      Q.  What does the field of radiology entail?

 4      A.  It's one of the specialities of medicine.  

 5  It has to do with all of the imaging that's 

 6  performed, whether it's x-rays, or ultrasound, or 

 7  mammograms even.  My specialty is, as I said, 

 8  orthopedic imaging.  Most of that is MRI, but we do 

 9  other things as well, x-rays, and CAT scans.

10      Q.  All right.  And so would those be considered 

11  subspecialties?

12      A.  Yes.

13      Q.  And what is the importance of your 

14  subspecialty in orthopedic imaging?

15      A.  So the importance of it is that we have 

16  added training with regard to analyzing images and 

17  determining if there is a traumatic injury, what 

18  type of traumatic injury it is.  

19          We grade it the way an orthopedic surgeon 

20  would find it useful.  We specifically convey 

21  information that an orthopedic surgeon or other type 

22  of orthopedic physician would find useful.  And we 

23  are kind of used to using the same kind of 

24  terminology and coming up with what we call a 


                                                               8

 1  mechanism of injury if we find a certain set of 

 2  findings.  

 3          So basically, we are kind of like the 

 4  imaging counterpart of an orthopedic surgeon.  

 5      Q.  Can you tell us a little bit about your 

 6  educational background?

 7      A.  I went to college at The University Of 

 8  Maryland.  After graduating, I moved to Philadelphia 

 9  to come to medical school at The University Of 

10  Pennsylvania.  After graduating from medical school, 

11  I entered my first year of post-graduate training.  

12  We call that internship down at Georgetown 

13  University Hospital, also in Washington, D.C.  

14          After finishing that, I moved back to 

15  Philadelphia to start my radiology residency.  

16  That's a four-year program, which I did at Jefferson 

17  University Hospital, here downtown.  After finishing 

18  that, I elected to stay at Jefferson for an 

19  additional year of training.  That was the 

20  orthopedic imaging, which I finished in 2007.  

21          I have been in practice ever since.  Most 

22  recently, I worked at Jefferson as a faculty member, 

23  doing orthopedic imaging.

24      Q.  All right.  And Doctor, can you please 


                                                               9

 1  describe your past and present teaching 

 2  responsibilities?

 3      A.  Sure.  Most of my teaching is to the 

 4  residents and the fellows at Jefferson University 

 5  Hospital.  I obviously teach them orthopedic 

 6  imaging.  In addition to that, I give lectures 

 7  around the country to other practicing radiologists 

 8  on various topics in orthopedic imaging.  

 9          I do teaching for emergency medicine 

10  residents, emergency medicine attendings, primarily 

11  in New Jersey, podiatry residents, who deal with the 

12  foot and ankle, orthopedic residents, who are, you 

13  know, orthopedic surgery trainings, both at the 

14  Rothman Institute here in Philadelphia and in New 

15  Jersey, and then various medical students from 

16  medical schools as well.

17      Q.  Dr. Dheer, are you Board certified?

18      A.  I am.

19      Q.  And can you explain to the jury what the 

20  significance of a Board certification is?

21      A.  Sure.  So to be Board certified, you 

22  essentially have to pass a series of examinations at 

23  different points in your training.  It starts all 

24  the way in medical school.  So you take a three-part 


                                                               10

 1  examination at the various different stages of 

 2  medical school in order to pass that.  You have to 

 3  pass those in order to graduate from medical school.  

 4          Then you take another series of three 

 5  examinations over the course of your radiology 

 6  residency to successfully complete that.  And then 

 7  most recently, actually, we have instituted a 

 8  re-certification process in radiology.  I'm actually 

 9  part of the group that develops that test and puts 

10  questions to other radiologists in order to take 

11  that test.  

12          I have obviously taken it myself as well.  I 

13  have passed it.  So that's essentially what it is.  

14  The bottom line is it gives the public, the general 

15  public, a degree of confidence that, you know, 

16  someone that's Board certified basically meets a 

17  certain level of expertise and experience in their 

18  intended profession.

19      Q.  All right.  How long have you been Board 

20  certified?

21      A.  I completed my Board certification for the 

22  first time in 2006.  And then I have re-certified 

23  several times since then.

24      Q.  All right.  Do you belong to any 


                                                               11

 1  professional societies?

 2      A.  I do.  I'm pretty much a member of all of 

 3  the major radiology societies, and then also the 

 4  largest subspecialty society for orthopedic 

 5  radiologists.

 6      Q.  All right.  Have you ever been published?

 7      A.  I have.  Being published, essentially, is 

 8  you do research.  You add to the peer-review 

 9  literature in the specialty that people learn from, 

10  and kind of we grow our knowledge base from that.  

11          In order to publish, obviously, you go 

12  through a process some call peer-review.  It's where 

13  your research methodology and your conclusions and 

14  your findings are all critiqued by your colleagues.  

15  So I have published several papers in the orthopedic 

16  radiology literature, in the orthopedic literature 

17  as well.  

18          And now in addition to publishing, I also 

19  critique other people's research, so I serve as an 

20  editor as well.

21      Q.  All right.  And I'm going to hand you now 

22  what has been previously marked for identification 

23  purposes as Dheer-1.  Can you identify that 

24  document, please?


                                                               12

 1      A.  This is my CV.  It's actually not the most 

 2  updated CV.  So for example, I used to be a clinical 

 3  instructor.  Now, I'm an assistant professor at 

 4  Jefferson.  But you know, so there is going to be 

 5  more publications and such, but essentially, it's 

 6  the same.

 7                  MR. LAVIN:  All right.  At this time 

 8          I would like to move Dheer-1 into evidence.

 9                  MR. SPEZIALI:  No objection.

10                  MR. LAVIN:  All right.  Your Honor, 

11          at this time I would like to offer 

12          Dr. Sachin Dheer as an expert in the field 

13          of radiology and orthopedic radiology.

14                  MR. SPEZIALI:  I have a few 

15          questions on Voir Dire.

19  BY MR. SPEZIALI:  

20      Q.  Doctor, where do you currently practice 

21  medicine?

22      A.  So my clinical practice is in both New 

23  Jersey and Philadelphia.  My academic work that I do 

24  as a professor, the research and the teaching, the 


                                                               13

 1  teaching is both in New Jersey and Philadelphia, 

 2  primarily New Jersey.  The research is exclusively 

 3  here in Philadelphia.

 4      Q.  So the clinical practice, where is that 

 5  located?

 6      A.  So physically, most of the days I sit in New 

 7  Jersey, but obviously, we are all connected 

 8  electronically now through our computer systems.  So 

 9  even though I am sitting physically in New Jersey, I 

10  read studies from all across the Delaware Valley.  

11  Frankly, we have facilities all the way up in 

12  Collegeville, Pennsylvania, all the way through to, 

13  you know, New Jersey.

14      Q.  And in New Jersey, that's the Cherry Hill 

15  campus; is that correct? 

16      A.  That's one of them.  So most days I'm 

17  actually physically in Marlton, New Jersey.  And the 

18  reason is because the Rothman Institute has a 

19  large -- kind of their New Jersey hub is in Marlton.  

20  It's a massive building.  We have an imaging center 

21  on the ground floor of their building.  Obviously, 

22  most of what we do is there imaging, because of the 

23  Rothman, you know, surgeons.  So I find myself there 

24  most days.


                                                               14

 1      Q.  How many days do you find yourself actively, 

 2  as far as it relates to your clinical practice, 

 3  practicing medicine in Pennsylvania?

 4      A.  So physically how often do I come?  

 5      Q.  Yes.  

 6      A.  I drive into Philly a couple times a month.

 7      Q.  Okay.  And that's just for your clinical 

 8  practice?  That's not --  

 9      A.  No.  That's -- that's -- again, when I come 

10  into Philly, it's -- I have to give lectures, you 

11  know, to medical students and residents, and you 

12  know, I have meetings for research projects that are 

13  ongoing and things like that.

14      Q.  Maybe my question wasn't clear.  You 

15  differentiated the clinical practice and your 

16  teaching practice and your research earlier.  I'm 

17  just concerned about clinical practice, right?  

18  Reviewing films for patients as a treating 

19  physician, right?  How many days do you spend doing 

20  that work in Pennsylvania?

21      A.  So again, the vast majority of the studies 

22  that I read are from Pennsylvania.

23      Q.  No.  I'm asking you physically.  How often 

24  do you physically -- do you go to Pennsylvania, go 


                                                               15

 1  to Philadelphia as it relates to you treating as a 

 2  treating physician?  

 3      A.  So I come to Philadelphia a few days a 

 4  month.  When I come in, I'm not just giving lecture.  

 5  That's like two hours a day, an hour a day.  Most of 

 6  my time is spent at the work station, reading, 

 7  dictating, you know, MRIs and x-rays, and things 

 8  like that.

 9      Q.  So maybe twice a month at most you come to 

10  Philadelphia.  The rest you are in New Jersey; is 

11  that accurate?

12      A.  Yes.

13      Q.  Okay.  And Doctor, how would you describe 

14  the work that you are doing for this case here 

15  today, litigation practice in your words?

16      A.  Sure.  So it's essentially consulting work 

17  that I'm asked to do.  So I get sent imaging 

18  studies.  I'm asked to determine if there is a 

19  traumatic injury of any kind.  If there is, I'm 

20  asked to describe it, characterize it, and determine 

21  if it could relate to an event that happened on a 

22  particular day.

23      Q.  And defense counsel's office hired you for 

24  this consulting work; is that correct?


                                                               16

 1      A.  That is correct.

 2      Q.  And have you done work for them previously?  

 3      A.  Yes, I have.

 4      Q.  And how long have you been engaging in this 

 5  litigation, giving consulting work, in your opinion, 

 6  for litigation cases?

 7      A.  So I first started doing it in 2011.  And 

 8  that was at the recommendation of my orthopedic 

 9  colleagues, you know.

10      Q.  Okay.  And how long have you been doing it 

11  for defense counsel's office?

12      A.  This particular firm?  

13      Q.  Yes.  

14      A.  I'm not sure.  It would have been some time 

15  after that.

16      Q.  Okay.  How often do you -- how often do you 

17  give depositions for litigation cases?

18      A.  A few times a month.

19      Q.  And how often do you author reports in 

20  relation to those cases?

21      A.  So how often do I author reports for 

22  litigation purposes?  

23      Q.  Yes.

24      A.  I would say maybe four to five a week.  So 


                                                               17

 1  it would amount to maybe 15 to 20 a month.

 2      Q.  And you're paid for that work, correct?

 3      A.  Correct.

 4      Q.  And in this matter, how much did you charge 

 5  for -- well, let me be clear.  You authored one 

 6  report in this matter; is that correct?

 7      A.  Yes.

 8      Q.  And that report is dated May 16th, 2019, 

 9  right?

10      A.  Yes.

11      Q.  And how much did you charge for that report?

12      A.  So the MRI report that I authored consists 

13  of three MRI examinations, one of the cervical 

14  spine, two of the right shoulder.  So for each MRI 

15  it's $200.  So the whole report would have been 

16  $600.

17      Q.  And you are also being -- you're also 

18  charging for your time and giving your opinions here 

19  today; is that correct?

20      A.  Correct.

21      Q.  And how much do you charge for that?

22      A.  $2,000.

23      Q.  Flat fee?

24      A.  Yes.


                                                               18

 1      Q.  Is there any other -- any other charges you 

 2  made for this case, anything else, reviewing 

 3  anything?

 4      A.  Not that I can think of, no.

 5      Q.  Okay.  And Doctor, what is the split, if you 

 6  know, between the work that you perform on behalf of 

 7  plaintiffs in these litigation cases and on behalf 

 8  of defendants, like the one here?

 9      A.  So in the situations where I actually know 

10  whether it's coming from a plaintiff attorney or a 

11  defense attorney, it's roughly 50/50.  And the 

12  reason I say "in the cases where I know" is because 

13  most of the time I actually don't know.  

14          And the reason for that is that most of the 

15  work that I get actually comes from these companies 

16  that basically, you know, put medical records 

17  together for their clients, whether, you know, 

18  whoever it may be.  And then they send it to me or 

19  they send it to whoever the appropriate expert might 

20  be in that particular matter.  

21          So in those cases, I don't know who their 

22  client is.  I don't know what side of the case they 

23  may be on.  It's makes no difference to me, because 

24  the way I do my reports is entirely the same.  


                                                               19

 1          But in situations where I do know who it's 

 2  coming from and I do have a general sense of, you 

 3  know, whether it's a plaintiff attorney or defense 

 4  attorney, it's roughly 50/50.  That being said, 

 5  there are some firms that do both.  So you know, in 

 6  cases where I know, it's roughly 50/50.

 7                  MR. SPEZIALI:  That's all I have.  

 8          No objections to the witness.

 9                  MR. LAVIN:  All right.  Joe Lavin 

10          here again on behalf of the defendant, Talia 

11          Crabbe.

13                  DIRECT EXAMINATION

14                         - - -

15  BY MR. LAVIN:  

16      Q.  Dr. Dheer, as you indicated, you reviewed 

17  three MRI films and authored a report regarding the 

18  plaintiff, Robert Miller, correct?

19      A.  Yes.

20      Q.  And that was at my request, correct?

21      A.  Correct.

22      Q.  All right.  I want to focus your attention 

23  on the two MRIs of the right shoulder.  Can we pull 

24  those up?


                                                               20

 1      A.  Sure.

 2      Q.  All right.

 3                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  

 4          Time is 4:16.  

 5                         - - -

 6                  (Whereupon, the following discussion 

 7  was held off the video record.)

 8                         - - -

 9                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Stand by.  We are 

10          back on record.  4:17.

11  BY MR. LAVIN:  

12      Q.  All right.  Dr. Dheer, this is an MRI film, 

13  correct?

14      A.  Yes.

15      Q.  Now, can you explain for me what you can see 

16  on an MRI?

17      A.  Sure.  So MRI stands for magnetic resonance 

18  imaging.  It's one of the types of imaging that we 

19  use in medicine.  It's somewhat unique in that there 

20  is no radiation involved.  

21          But the other thing that is very unique 

22  about MRI is that it allows us to differentiate 

23  between different types of tissues in the body, 

24  whether it's bones or cartilage or muscle or tendon 


                                                               21

 1  or, you know, nerves.  It allows us to differentiate 

 2  all of those structures better than any other type 

 3  of imaging.  

 4          So it's been revolutionary, certainly in 

 5  orthopedics, but in other specialities as well, 

 6  because it allows you to visualize organs and other 

 7  things as well.  

 8          So within orthopedics, specifically, we're 

 9  obviously concerned with the orthopedic-type 

10  structures, the bones and the cartilage and the 

11  muscles and so on and so forth.  So the first thing 

12  to realize is that any time we get any MRI of any 

13  body part, we get different types of imaging in 

14  different orientations.  

15          Okay.  So let me orient you first.  Imagine 

16  you are looking at Mr. Miller's right shoulder from 

17  the front.  So you are standing in front of 

18  Mr. Miller, okay, and you are kind of looking at his 

19  shoulder from the front.

20      Q.  All right.  I want to stop you there, 

21  Doctor.  Just for clarification purposes, what we 

22  are looking at now is a right shoulder MRI of the 

23  plaintiff, correct?

24      A.  Correct.


                                                               22

 1      Q.  And that MRI is dated January 13th of 

 2  2015; correct?

 3      A.  That is correct.

 4      Q.  All right.  So we are here for an accident, 

 5  which occurred on October 10th of 2015.  So this MRI 

 6  that was done on January 13th of 2015 would have 

 7  been before that date of accident, correct?

 8      A.  Correct.  It was about nine months before 

 9  the accident.  So even before we get in to what the 

10  findings are, right away we are aware that 

11  Mr. Miller had some complaints of his right 

12  shoulder, which sought him to seek out medical 

13  attention and MRI evaluation nine months before the 

14  accident.

15      Q.  So can you tell us what we are looking at in 

16  this MRI?

17      A.  Yes.  So imagine you are looking at 

18  Mr. Miller's shoulder from the front.  So this is 

19  actually going to be the surface of his shoulder.  

20  And this is kind of the rounding of the outside of 

21  his shoulder.  That's his skin surface.  This right 

22  -- this muscle right here is actually his deltoid 

23  muscle.  

24          So kind of the first muscle right under the 


                                                               23

 1  skin.  There is actually two joints within the 

 2  shoulder.  There's the glenohumeral joint, which is 

 3  the ball-and-socket joint.  So this is the socket.  

 4  This is the ball or the humeral head, which leads to 

 5  the arm.  

 6          And then as we kind of go back and forth 

 7  from front to back and back to front, again, kind of 

 8  taking slices through his shoulder as we are looking 

 9  at it from the front.  This is the other joint, the 

10  AC joint, or the acromioclavicular joint.  

11          I think most people are familiar with that.  

12  If you kind of press down on your -- on the top of 

13  your shoulder right under your skin, you feel, you 

14  know, two hard bones.  That's your AC joint, okay? 

15          So most important structure in the shoulder 

16  to look at is the rotator cuff.  So the rotator cuff 

17  are a series of muscles and tendons, which basically 

18  give you the ability to elevate your arm.  

19          And so, this is the most important muscle of 

20  the rotator cuff, the supraspinatus muscle, this 

21  kind of gray structure right here.  It goes this way 

22  underneath the AC joint, which is out here, turns 

23  into the tendon.  So the muscle turns into the 

24  tendon and inserts on the outside of the arm or the 


                                                               24

 1  humeral head, the ball of the ball-and-socket joint.  

 2          So you can imagine every time the 

 3  supraspinatus muscle and the other rotator cuff 

 4  muscles contract, which is what muscles do, it pulls 

 5  on this portion of the arm.  And your arm gets 

 6  elevated.  So that's how the rotator cuff works to 

 7  elevate your arm.  

 8          So in this particular individual, there is 

 9  no tear of the rotator cuff.  So you can see that 

10  there is a very nice continuous muscle leading to 

11  the tendon and inserting on the bone.  So that's 

12  good.  

13          There is something called tendinosis, which 

14  is essentially wear-and-tear or aging of that 

15  tendon.  And the reason we see this very commonly in 

16  virtually everybody that gets imaged kind of from 

17  their late 20s all through their adulthood is 

18  because all of the ligamentous and tendinous 

19  structures in the body have very poor blood supply.  

20          And so as a result, they start to undergo 

21  degeneration and aging.  We call that process 

22  tendinosis.  So this individual has tendinosis, 

23  which you would expect.  It's normal at this age.

24      Q.  So on this MRI film, which is dated January 


                                                               25

 1  13th of 2015, you do see tendinosis there?

 2      A.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.

 3      Q.  All right.  And that's a degenerative 

 4  process?

 5      A.  Yes.  It's aging of the tendon.  It's, you 

 6  know, the tendon is made of collagen, which is 

 7  connective tissue in our body.  And like I said, 

 8  collagen has very poor blood supply.  

 9          And so as we kind of age from our mid- to 

10  late-20s on through adulthood, it -- you know, all 

11  of the collagen in our body undergoes, you know, 

12  very slow, very progressive aging.  Specifically 

13  with regard to a tendon, it's called tendinosis.

14      Q.  All right.  Is there anything else that you 

15  are seeing in this right shoulder MRI?

16      A.  Yeah.  So, you know, the tendinosis is not 

17  really significant, because it's not necessarily 

18  causing problems or considered abnormal even, 

19  because everybody has it.  

20          What there is, is significant 

21  osteoarthritis.  Or, you know, most people just 

22  think of it as arthritis.  But it's essentially, you 

23  know, chronic ongoing kind of wear-and-tear of this 

24  ball-and-socket joint, the glenohumeral joint of the 


                                                               26

 1  shoulder.  

 2          So specifically, what are we seeing?  We are 

 3  seeing that the cartilage has, over years and years, 

 4  has kind of worn out to the point where it's gone.  

 5  There is something called a labrum, which is 

 6  essentially, again, a ring of cartilage that lines 

 7  the socket of the ball-and-socket joint, kind of 

 8  gives you added stability.  

 9          It's what allows us to have a great 

10  360-degree range of motion without dislocating our 

11  shoulder.  So the cartilage is worn away.  The 

12  labrum is -- is worn away to the point where it's 

13  completely resorbed and absent.  That's something 

14  that occurs over many, many years, and this kind of 

15  represents the end stage of that.

16      Q.  Can you point out for the jury where on the 

17  MRI you are seeing that so we can understand that?

18      A.  Yes.  Absolutely.  So this individual 

19  doesn't really have any significant labrum left.  

20  Where I would see it is over here at the bottom, and 

21  I would see it over here at the top.  

22          So you can see there is a little remnant of 

23  the labrum left at the top, but all along the lining 

24  of the shoulder here and at the bottom, it's 


                                                               27

 1  completely resorbed.  It's absent.  

 2          And so not only is it kind of worn out, but 

 3  the body has resorbed it.  And that takes many, many 

 4  years to happen.  And then because of that, there's 

 5  arthritis of the shoulder.  So this is actually a 

 6  big bone spur that's projecting off the bottom of 

 7  the socket.

 8      Q.  What is a bone spur?

 9      A.  A bone spur is basically extra bone that 

10  forms at the margin of a joint.  It's really the 

11  body's response to the fact that there has been this 

12  ongoing several years of just, you know, wear-and-

13  tear of the joint.  

14          So any time we see bone spurs -- and they 

15  occur everywhere in the body -- so arthritis in the 

16  knee looks the same, and arthritis in the shoulder 

17  looks the same, and arthritis in the back looks the 

18  same.  

19          It's all the same process.  The body 

20  responds the same way, you know, with this ongoing 

21  kind of wear-and-tear that occurs over many years 

22  progressively and you end up getting arthritis.  

23          This particular degree of arthritis in the 

24  shoulder is fairly advanced in that this is a very 


                                                               28

 1  large bony spur.  And it takes a long time for these 

 2  types of bony spurs to get this big.  So that's kind 

 3  of how I can look at the shoulder.  

 4          And I can kind of confidently tell you that 

 5  there is no injury here that would, you know, have 

 6  occurred.  All of this is something that has been 

 7  kind of developing in a very, very slow progressive 

 8  fashion over many, many years.  And what we are 

 9  looking at is kind of an end-stage arthritis in this 

10  shoulder.

11      Q.  All right.  And so I just want to focus your 

12  attention that this MRI is dated January 13th of 

13  2015, which would have been before the date of 

14  accident that we are here for today, October 10th of 

15  2015, correct? 

16      A.  Correct.  This was nine months before the 

17  accident.  And so basically, nine months before the 

18  accident, Mr. Miller was having some complaints of 

19  his right shoulder, which lead him to get this MRI.  

20  And I look at an MRI like this, and I say, "yeah, 

21  that makes total sense."  There is advanced 

22  osteoarthritis of this glenohumeral joint.

23      Q.  All right.  Now, you also reviewed an MRI of 

24  the right shoulder after this accident, correct?  


                                                               29

 1      A.  Yes.

 2      Q.  All right.  Can we pull up that image, 

 3  please?

 4      A.  Sure.

 5                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.

 9  was held off the video record.)

11                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Stand by.  We are 

12          back on.  4:27.

13  BY MR. LAVIN:  

14      Q.  All right, Dr. Dheer.  So we have pulled up 

15  an MRI of the right shoulder.  This MRI is dated 

16  December 15th of 2015, correct?

17      A.  Correct.

18      Q.  And can you tell me what we are seeing in 

19  this MRI?

20      A.  Sure.  All right.  So this is an MRI that 

21  was done about two months after the accident-in-

22  question.  And same type of image.  We are looking 

23  at the front of Mr. Miller's shoulder.  

24          So this is the surface on the outside of his 


                                                               30

 1  shoulder.  This is that deltoid muscle.  We are 

 2  going to go back and forth a little bit.  This is 

 3  the supraspinatus muscle, turning into the tendon, 

 4  inserting on the humeral head.  All of that is 

 5  unchanged.  

 6          There is tendinosis of the rotator cuff, not 

 7  surprising.  And what else do we see?  We see this 

 8  osteoarthritis that we were just talking about.  You 

 9  can see that the cartilage is totally worn away.  

10  The labrum is totally worn away.  You get these big 

11  large osteophytes or bone spurs at the margin of the 

12  joint.  

13          It's no different than the image that we 

14  just looked at that was done, you know, 13 months or 

15  more, you know, from this MRI.  All right.  So that 

16  study was done about nine months before the 

17  accident.  This MRI is done about two months after.  

18  So the time span between the two is actually 11 

19  months, so almost a year.  But the images look the 

20  same.

21      Q.  All right.  So now, I'm going to refer to 

22  what has been previously marked for identification 

23  purposes as Dheer-2.  This is your report in this 

24  matter, correct?


                                                               31

 1      A.  Uh-huh.

 2      Q.  And this report -- is that a yes?

 3      A.  Yes.

 4      Q.  All right.  And that report is dated May 

 5  16th of 2019, correct?

 6      A.  Correct.

 7      Q.  Now, Dr. Dheer, after reviewing the two sets 

 8  of right shoulder MRIs, did you form an impression 

 9  based on that review?

10      A.  I did.

11      Q.  And what was the impression and reasoning 

12  behind your conclusion?

13      A.  Okay.  So the first impression was that just 

14  looking at this second MRI in isolation, I looked 

15  for traumatic injuries, and there were none.  Okay.  

16  No traumatic injuries of any kind.  So no muscle 

17  tears, no ligament or tendon tears, no fractures, no 

18  bruising or contusion, no dislocations, no 

19  collections of blood or fluid.  You know, just no 

20  injury of any kind.  

21          Then, I compared this MRI to the one that 

22  was done nine months before the accident.  And the 

23  findings were exactly the same.  

24          So not only was I able to review this MRI on 


                                                               32

 1  its own and say that there is no injury, I was able 

 2  to look at that first MRI and say, "Well, that makes 

 3  sense that the findings are completely unchanged 

 4  between the two MRIs, so we have basically proved 

 5  visually that there is all of the findings that we 

 6  are seeing in the shoulder predate this, you know, 

 7  reported date of injury, that they were there many, 

 8  many months before this accident."

 9      Q.  All right.  So just let me clarify for the 

10  jury.  So essentially your testimony is that there 

11  isn't any imaging evidence of an injury related to 

12  the October 10th of 2015 accident?

13      A.  Correct.

14      Q.  All right.  Doctor, is this opinion given 

15  within a reasonable degree of medical certainty?

16      A.  Yes.

17      Q.  All right.  Now, you also reviewed a film of 

18  the cervical spine, correct?

19      A.  I did.

20      Q.  All right.  Can we pull that up, please?

21      A.  Sure.  And that's actually on the same disc 

22  here, so. 

23      Q.  All right.  So can you explain to the jury 

24  what we are looking at here?


                                                               33

 1      A.  Sure.  So again, we just popped up a new set 

 2  of images.  So again, Robert Miller, right, his 

 3  date-of-birth.  And it was done on February 23rd, 

 4  2016.  And this is his cervical spine or what most 

 5  people think of as the neck.  

 6          So recall, we get different images in 

 7  different orientations.  Imagine you are looking at 

 8  Mr. Miller's neck from the side, okay?  So this is 

 9  actually the front of his neck or his throat.  This 

10  is his chin out here.  

11          This is actually his tongue, the muscles in 

12  his tongue.  This is the base of his brain.  This is 

13  the back of his head.  This is the back of his neck, 

14  the back of his upper back over here.  His throat, 

15  his trachea are over here.  This is his epiglottis 

16  actually over there.  All right.  So -- 

17      Q.  All right.  Dr. Dheer, can I just stop you 

18  for a second?

19      A.  Yes.

20      Q.  This is the MRI of the cervical spine, 

21  correct? 

22      A.  Correct.

23      Q.  And that MRI is dated February 23rd of 2016, 

24  correct?


                                                               34

 1      A.  Correct.

 2      Q.  All right.  So can you continue explaining 

 3  what we are looking at?

 4      A.  Sure.

 5      Q.  Thank you.

 6      A.  So when we look at the cervical spine, we 

 7  recognize the fact that there are basically a series 

 8  of stacked bones.  We call those the vertebrae, 

 9  okay, that give us the rigidity and the stature in 

10  our necks.  All right.  And that's these 

11  squared-structures over here, okay.

12          And then in between them are soft tissue 

13  structures, again, made up of collagen, right, that 

14  we were talking about earlier, connective tissue in 

15  the body.  And we call those the intervertebral 

16  discs or just the discs.

17          And the reason we need those is because that 

18  gives us the ability to flex and twist and extend 

19  our spines and including our necks.  So we have the 

20  vertebrae and we have the intervertebral discs.  

21          Immediately behind that, we have this 

22  structure that comes out of the base of the brain 

23  and goes all the way down the spinal canal.  Okay.  

24  And is bathed in spinal fluid, which is this bright 


                                                               35

 1  material over here.  That structure is a very 

 2  important structure.  It's the spinal cord.  

 3          Right.  It carries all the nerves and 

 4  signals from the brain down through the spinal canal 

 5  to the rest of our body.  And then on each side of 

 6  the cervical spine towards the back are the facet 

 7  joints.  Okay.  And these are like no different than 

 8  all the other joints in the body.  Right.  

 9          They basically form an articulation or a 

10  joint that holds the bones together and allows us to 

11  move.  So this is one side, the facet joints over 

12  here.  And then we're going to go off the other side 

13  of the neck.  And these are the facet joints over 

14  here.  So right away this individual has arthritis 

15  of the facet joints.  

16      Q.  How can you tell that?

17      A.  It's no different than the arthritis that we 

18  saw in the shoulder.  You can see the bony spurs 

19  here.  You can see the thickening of the joint 

20  capsules here.  

21          The reason I can say that this is fairly 

22  significant facet arthropathy is because, as the 

23  facet joints start to get arthritic and the bones, 

24  you know, kind of aren't held together the way they 


                                                               36

 1  should because of the degenerative change, you start 

 2  to get movement of one of the vertebra on another.  

 3          And we are actually seeing a little bit of 

 4  that over here.  And again, no different than we saw 

 5  on the shoulder, the vertebrae respond to that by 

 6  forming these bony spurs.  So not only do we see the 

 7  arthritis in the facet joints, we see the bony spur 

 8  formation in the vertebrae themselves.  

 9          And then because there is this arthritis and 

10  this wear-and-tear of the spine, you start to see 

11  these age-related changes within the discs that we 

12  talked about as well.  So the first age-related 

13  change you see is the fact that these discs are 

14  dark.  

15          Now, unless you have, you know, a young 

16  person's spine to compare to, you don't realize 

17  this, but these discs are actually supposed to be 

18  much brighter, because on this type of MRI image, 

19  fluid is bright.  And normal discs, young, healthy 

20  discs contain a fair amount of fluid with the 

21  connective tissue.  

22          The fact that these discs are so dark tells 

23  you that they are what we call desiccated or 

24  dehydrated.  They've lost water content.  


                                                               37

 1      Q.  Now, would that happen related to a car 

 2  accident?

 3      A.  No.  That's actually the opposite of what 

 4  you see in a traumatic injury.  When there is a 

 5  traumatic injury of a disc or any other structure in 

 6  the body, immediately the body has this intense, 

 7  what we call, inflammatory reaction.  So it's the 

 8  body's attempt to kind of like heal this off.

 9      Q.  Would you be able to see that on the MRI?

10      A.  Definitely.  In fact, that's why people 

11  order MRIs.  And that's my job as an orthopedic 

12  radiologist to find these types of changes on the 

13  spine, not just age-related changes.  But we look 

14  for traumatic injuries, too.  And we characterize 

15  them and describe how severe they might be, and what 

16  structures are involved, and you know, all that.

17      Q.  Now, if you did see a traumatic image on the 

18  MRI, what would you be looking for?

19      A.  Okay.  So for example, a traumatic injury of 

20  the disc, the disc would be extremely bright, 

21  because there would be the immediate recruitment of 

22  inflammatory fluid and even blood we see sometimes, 

23  which we don't see that in any of these discs.  

24  These discs are extremely dark or desiccated.  They 


                                                               38

 1  have lost water content.  

 2          If we see a traumatic injury of any of the 

 3  ligaments that kind of hold everything together.  So 

 4  there is an anterior longitudinal ligament.  There's 

 5  a posterior longitudinal ligament.  There is 

 6  something called the interspinous ligament and then 

 7  the nuchal and supraspinous ligament, which runs 

 8  down the back of the spine here.

 9          Any time those are injured, we see fluid 

10  surrounding them.  If it's a severe injury of the 

11  ligament, we grade them as one, two, or three.  You 

12  know, we'll see, you know, frank, you know, free 

13  edges of the torn fibres of the ligament, you know, 

14  sitting in the middle of this fluid and blood.  We 

15  obviously don't see that here.  

16          If you see fractures, you'll see a fracture 

17  line, extending through the bone.  You may see a 

18  deformity of the bone.  Again, that will be 

19  accompanied by this intense fluid build-up.  So it 

20  literally shows up as extremely bright signal on the 

21  MRI.

22      Q.  All right.  So I just want to clarify for 

23  the jury that if there were a traumatic injury, 

24  there's several things that you would be able to see 


                                                               39

 1  on this MRI, correct?

 2      A.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

 3      Q.  And you are not seeing that on this MRI?

 4      A.  No.  None of those findings are present.  

 5  And then just to give you an idea of what it is to 

 6  be an orthopedic radiologist, not only do we find 

 7  those findings, not only do we grade those findings 

 8  the way an orthopedic surgeon would, but then we put 

 9  all the findings together, and we come up with a 

10  mechanism of injury.  

11          Like, you know, so when I do see traumatic 

12  injuries in the spine, I don't just say "this is 

13  torn," "that's fractured."  I say all of that.  And 

14  then I'll conclude by saying "this is consistent 

15  with a hyperflexion mechanism of injury" or a 

16  hyperextension or a torsion or axial loading.  Those 

17  are all, you know, different mechanisms that can 

18  result in different types of -- of injuries in the 

19  spine, so. 

20      Q.  All right.  So I want to refer you back to 

21  your report of May 16th of 2019 that you had a 

22  chance to review this MRI of the cervical spine, 

23  dated February 23rd of 2016.  Did you form an 

24  impression based on this review?


                                                               40

 1      A.  Yes.

 2      Q.  Would you explain to us your impression and 

 3  the reasoning behind your conclusions?

 4      A.  Okay.  So my impression is that there's no 

 5  traumatic injury of any kind.  Examples would 

 6  include ligament and tendon tears, fractures, 

 7  bruising, contusions, injuries of the spinal cord, 

 8  the nerves.  All those things can be injured.  We 

 9  don't see any of those.  

10          What I do see are very characteristic 

11  age-related changes in the spine, so arthritis of 

12  the facet joints, degenerative changes, and 

13  arthritic changes related to the discs and the 

14  vertebrae that surround the discs.  And that's, 

15  again, very characteristic.  Everybody develops 

16  them, depending on, you know, how old they are.  

17          And we see them very commonly.  And we 

18  obviously describe them.  So that is what I see 

19  here.  But I don't see any type of traumatic injury 

20  whatsoever.

21      Q.  All right.  So just for clarity purposes, 

22  it's your opinion that you don't see any imaging 

23  evidence of an injury as a result of the October 

24  10th of 2015 accident?


                                                               41

 1      A.  Yes.

 2      Q.  All right.  Doctor, is this opinion given 

 3  within a reasonable degree of medical certainty?

 4      A.  Absolutely, yes.

 5                  MR. LAVIN:  All right.  At this time 

 6          I would move to enter Dr. Dheer's report of 

 7          May 16th, 2019 into evidence.  I have no 

 8          further questions.

 9                  MR. SPEZIALI:  No objection.  Take 

10          that down for me.

22  BY MR. SPEZIALI:  

23      Q.  Good afternoon, Doctor.  Doctor, I just want 

24  to be clear.  You are not a surgeon, correct?


                                                               42

 1      A.  Correct.

 2      Q.  And you are not a neurologist?

 3      A.  Correct.

 4      Q.  And you have a subset in radiology, but you 

 5  are not an orthopedist; is that correct?

 6      A.  Correct.

 7      Q.  And Doctor, you are not a treating 

 8  physician, correct?

 9      A.  Correct.

10      Q.  And you're not a treating physician.  There 

11  is no doctor/physician/patient relationship here, 

12  correct?

13      A.  Correct.

14      Q.  You saw Mr. Miller on behalf of defense 

15  counsel's office?

16      A.  That is correct.

17      Q.  And you never saw -- you never met Robert 

18  Miller, correct?

19      A.  Correct.

20      Q.  What did you review in preparation for your 

21  report that's -- that we have marked here today?

22      A.  So I received the imaging studies.  I 

23  reviewed the imaging studies, went through them in 

24  my usual kind of checklist fashion that I have.  I 


                                                               43

 1  dictated my reports.  And I sent it off.

 2      Q.  Now, when you say "the imaging studies," are 

 3  you just talking about the films that you reviewed 

 4  on camera?

 5      A.  Yes, the MRI images themselves.

 6      Q.  Did you have a chance to review the reading 

 7  radiologist's report?

 8      A.  I did not.  

 9      Q.  So you didn't even review -- the reading 

10  radiologist, that would be considered a treating 

11  physician, correct?

12      A.  No.  So the reading radiologist would be a 

13  diagnostic physician.  That's what I do in my day 

14  job.  We review MRIs, but we don't treat people.

15      Q.  Okay.  So it's already been said as a 

16  treating radiologist or a radiologist with a -- with 

17  a physician/patient relationship, that would be the 

18  reading radiologist, correct?

19      A.  Yes.

20      Q.  And you didn't have -- you didn't take the 

21  opportunity -- you didn't take the chance to read 

22  the reading radiologist's reports that are authored 

23  for the studies here today, correct? 

24      A.  That's correct.  I did not need to.


                                                               44

 1      Q.  You didn't take the opportunity to read the 

 2  report from January 2015, correct?

 3      A.  That would be the shoulder MRI?

 4      Q.  Yes.

 5      A.  I did not need to, that's correct.

 6      Q.  I'm not asking you whether you needed to or 

 7  not, Doctor.  I'm asking you if you did.  And I want 

 8  to be clear for the record, right?  You can opine.  

 9  We get it.  You are too good.  You don't need to 

10  read the report.  But I want to be clear for the 

11  record.  I'm just asking you if you actually did.  

12      A.  No.  So I did not.  And the reason I did not 

13  is because I did not need to.  If I would need to 

14  review a record before I authored a report, I would 

15  ask for it.

16      Q.  Right.  And I just want the record to be 

17  clear, because you are responding on what you need 

18  to do or not.  And I just want to be clear whether 

19  you did, all right?  It's real similar, Doc.  I'm 

20  just asking you yes-or-no questions to be clear for 

21  the jury. 

22      A.  Right.  I did not, because I did not need 

23  to.

24      Q.  All right.  So and then also for the MRI of 


                                                               45

 1  the cervical spine, you didn't read the reading 

 2  radiologist's report for that either, correct? 

 3      A.  The exact same thing.  I did not, because I 

 4  did not need to.

 5      Q.  Was that given to you?

 6      A.  No.

 7      Q.  So that was -- the radiologist's report, the 

 8  independent physician, those records weren't even 

 9  provided to you for your review, correct?

10      A.  That is correct.

11      Q.  Okay.  And as well as that's the shoulder 

12  MRI of December 2015.  Again, I get it.  You didn't 

13  need to.  It wasn't given to you.  And you never 

14  reviewed it, correct?

15      A.  That's correct.

16      Q.  Is that the common -- when you review these 

17  cases for litigation, is that -- well, strike that 

18  question.  As a reading radiologist, if you are 

19  reviewing something for a patient, right, that 

20  you -- that you are treating or diagnosing or doing 

21  diagnostics on, would you ever review the reading 

22  radiologist's report?

23      A.  I am the reading radiologist, so no report 

24  exists.


                                                               46

 1      Q.  As a comparison, right?  As an earlier 

 2  study?

 3      A.  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  So for 

 4  example, if it's -- you know, if I'm following up a 

 5  tumor and, you know, I want to know what the prior 

 6  radiologist may have measured it as, then yes.  But 

 7  many times I won't, because I don't need to.

 8      Q.  So in instances where you want to make a 

 9  comparison in time, in those instances, it might be 

10  a case that you do read them, right?  But you didn't 

11  read them here just to be clear?

12      A.  No, no.  That's not correct.  That's not 

13  what I said.  

14      Q.  You did read them?

15      A.  No.  You said two things.  The first part 

16  was incorrect.  The second part was correct.  So I 

17  did not read the original radiologist's report in 

18  this case, because, as I said, I did not need to.  I 

19  was the -- you know, the expert radiologist 

20  consultant in this case, right?  

21          The other thing is you asked me is do I 

22  normally always compare?  And the answer is I don't.

23      Q.  No.  I didn't say "always."  I said 

24  "sometimes."  Like I said, I said "sometimes."


                                                               47

 1      A.  Oh, okay.

 2      Q.  I was summarizing what you said.  Sometimes 

 3  when you are comparing two things in time and you 

 4  want to see them -- you gave an example of I believe 

 5  it was a tumor.  Sometimes you review the prior 

 6  reading radiologist's studies, right?  Sometimes you 

 7  do that?

 8      A.  It depends.  So if I don't have the prior 

 9  images, then, you know, I need a report, because I 

10  need to know what the images would have shown.  If I 

11  do have the prior images, sometimes I will look at 

12  the prior report.  Sometimes I won't.  Sometimes I 

13  have to, to do what's called a peer review on 

14  another interpreting radiologist.  But a lot of 

15  times if we don't need to, we don't.

16      Q.  And did you review any other records here?

17      A.  No.

18      Q.  Just the films that were shown on the 

19  laptop, correct? 

20      A.  Well, I wouldn't say just the films.  It 

21  takes a lot of expertise to review them.  So yes, 

22  the films.

23      Q.  Okay.  Solely the films?

24      A.  Yes, solely the films.


                                                               48

 1      Q.  Apologies, Doctor.  I didn't mean to demean 

 2  the MRI films.  So you didn't see any of the 

 3  physicians that treated Robert Miller, you didn't 

 4  see any of their records or reports, correct?

 5      A.  That's correct.

 6      Q.  You didn't see any of the notes from the 

 7  months of treatment and therapy that he underwent, 

 8  correct?

 9      A.  Correct.

10      Q.  And you didn't perform any physical 

11  examination on him, correct?

12      A.  Correct.  I have never met him.  My 

13  examination consisted of an analysis of the imaging 

14  studies, which are obviously a view to the inside of 

15  his body, the shoulder and the cervical spine.

16      Q.  Is that really an examination?  Isn't that 

17  just a film review?  I mean you didn't examine -- I 

18  want to be clear for the jury.  I don't want to call 

19  that an examination if it's not.  But isn't that 

20  just a review of the films?

21      A.  Actually, not calling it an examination is, 

22  I think, misleading.  So it is absolutely an 

23  examination.  It's an examination of the inside of 

24  someone's body, right?  


                                                               49

 1          I mean that's what we are doing.  We're 

 2  looking at all of the different anatomy.  We're 

 3  looking at whatever derangement may be present.  

 4  We're determining if there's an injury of any kind.  

 5  We're determining if there is any significant 

 6  findings that need to be communicated to somebody.  

 7          It is absolutely an examination.  It's not a 

 8  physical examination, where I meet Mr. Miller or put 

 9  my hands on Mr. Miller.  But in many ways it's much 

10  more powerful than a visual inspection.  Because I'm 

11  looking at the inside of his body.  So yes, that's 

12  an examination.  

13          And it's actually for that reason that when 

14  I do this in my day job, there is a doctor/patient 

15  relationship that is established.

16      Q.  So the examination you performed is one on 

17  that computer or on another computer somewhere, the 

18  MRIs, correct?

19      A.  It's an examination -- it's an examination 

20  of Mr. Miller's cervical spine and right shoulder 

21  done through the MRI.

22      Q.  All right.  So solely done through the MRI, 

23  correct?

24      A.  Correct.


                                                               50

 1      Q.  You never met him, you never saw him, no 

 2  examination, you never were in the same room with 

 3  him, you never asked him, you know, what hurt, how 

 4  much does it hurt, anything like that, correct?

 5      A.  Incorrect, because you said no examination 

 6  of him, and I just clarified --

 7      Q.  Oh, physical.  I apologize, Doctor.

 8      A.  -- there was an examination.

 9      Q.  I apologize.  You physically examined him 

10  through the MRI films, through the computer, through 

11  the screen.  I meant physical.  I apologize.

12      A.  No.  I didn't physically examine him.  I 

13  examined his cervical spine and his right shoulder 

14  through the MRI.

15      Q.  Do you know how old Mr. Miller is?

16      A.  I could tell you by looking at his date-of-

17  birth.  So he was born in 1958.  So it would be -- 

18  at the time of the first MRI, he would have been 

19  approximately 57 or almost 57.  

20      Q.  I'm asking you right now.  Did that come in 

21  to your opinions at all?  Did you use that 

22  information in developing any of your opinions at 

23  all?

24      A.  Yes.  And so the reason it's important is 


                                                               51

 1  because when you look at an individual's age, you 

 2  develop a sense of what type of findings, what type 

 3  of age-related findings they tend to have.  

 4          So for example, if I saw glenohumeral 

 5  osteoarthritis in a 20-year-old, you know, that 

 6  would give me pause.  You know, I would say that's 

 7  unusual.  We don't usually see glenohumeral 

 8  osteoarthritis in a 20-year-old.  

 9          So this 20-year-old has been engaged in some 

10  type of activity that has led to, you know,     

11  wear-and-tear of the shoulder joint.  So yes, I do 

12  that type of analysis with every study I look at 

13  frankly.

14      Q.  And as we -- is it fair to say that as we 

15  get up there in age, it's common to see age-related 

16  degeneration in, oftentimes, many individuals that 

17  you examine by way of the -- 

18      A.  Virtually everybody.

19      Q.  And but people can still get injured even 

20  though they have those age-related issues, correct? 

21      A.  Absolutely, yes.

22      Q.  And is it possible to have -- speak to say 

23  the cervical spine.  Is it possible to have a 

24  herniation or protrusion with the cervical spine 


                                                               52

 1  that is -- that is caused by age, but is 

 2  asymptomatic?

 3      A.  Yes.

 4      Q.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but just so the 

 5  jury understands my question, that means that there 

 6  could be a protrusion or herniation, and someone's 

 7  not experiencing pain; is that accurate?

 8      A.  That is correct.

 9      Q.  And then due to something along the line, is 

10  it possible for that herniation then to be 

11  aggravated and then to the individual to then start 

12  experiencing pain?

13      A.  Absolutely.  And that's exactly what you 

14  were referring to before.  You said is it possible 

15  for people to have traumatic injuries that occur on 

16  top of these age-related changes.  

17          And in fact, that's what we see most of the 

18  time, because virtually everybody has age-related 

19  changes, depending on, you know, how old they are.  

20          And then, you know, a certain subset of 

21  those people unfortunately do sustain traumatic 

22  injuries on whatever body part that we are looking 

23  at.  So, you know, they can have a traumatic injury 

24  superimposed on.  Or another way to say it is 


                                                               53

 1  aggravating a degenerative change.

 2          But again, if that's, in fact, the case, 

 3  then you would see that on the MRI.  You would see 

 4  that traumatic injury, that traumatic abnormality, 

 5  whether it's the fluid build-up or the hemorrhage, 

 6  or the tear of the ligament or a tendon on top of or 

 7  in addition to or aggravating the age-related change 

 8  that was already there.

 9          Just to be clear, that's not the case here.  

10  What we see in this case are solely age-related 

11  degenerative findings that were present well-before, 

12  you know, this accident.  

13          In fact, we have proven that in the right 

14  shoulder by comparing the MRI before and after the 

15  accident.  So you don't even have to believe me.  

16  You can just look at the images.  You know, they 

17  show you what it is.  But if, hypothetically, we 

18  have had an MRI of the cervical spine that was done, 

19  you know, before this accident, it would look the 

20  same, too, just like the shoulder does.  

21          So that's the case here.  But yes, it is 

22  theoretically possible for somebody to sustain a 

23  traumatic injury on top of these age-related 

24  changes.  We see that all the time.  I see that all 


                                                               54

 1  the time in my practice, because everybody has 

 2  age-related changes and some people do have 

 3  traumatic injuries.

 4                  MR. SPEZIALI:  Let's go off the 

 5          record for a second.

 6                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the 

 7          record.  The time is 4:50.

 8                         - - -

 9                  (Whereupon, the following discussion 

10  was held off the video record.)

11                         - - -

12                  MR. SPEZIALI:  I'm going to object 

13          to the doctor's opinion as beyond the 

14          report.  The report is pure speculation as 

15          to if we had a prior cervical MRI what it 

16          would show.  No basis and fact, and just 

17          pure speculation on the doctor's part.  Go 

18          back on.

19                  THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on.  

20          4:50.

21  BY MR. SPEZIALI:  

22      Q.  And Doctor, I know we have a prior MRI of 

23  the shoulder, but we don't have a prior MRI of the 

24  cervical spine, correct?


                                                               55

 1      A.  That's correct.

 2      Q.  So you don't really know what a prior MRI of 

 3  the cervical spine would look like, right?

 4      A.  I would expect it to look the same based on 

 5  the fact that the MRI after the accident --

 6      Q.  I'm asking you what you would know.  Would 

 7  you know without speculating -- would you know for 

 8  sure what it would look like or would that be just 

 9  speculation on your part?

10      A.  It would be -- it would be a logic -- it 

11  wouldn't be speculation.  It would be a logical 

12  conclusion based on my review of the MRI that I 

13  reviewed.  It's a logical conclusion.

14      Q.  Okay.  And how long does that logic hold?  I 

15  mean can you speculate -- or I'm sorry.  That logic, 

16  does that hold for ten years or twenty years back 

17  that you can -- you can --

18      A.  -- generally.

19      Q.  -- give an opinion as to -- as to what that 

20  cervical MRI would look like?

21      A.  No.  So generally, twenty years -- over 

22  twenty years we do tend to see changes, progression 

23  at age-related changes.  Even at ten years we tend 

24  to see progression at age-related changes.


                                                               56

 1          I can think of examples just from the last 

 2  few days of me being at work, where five years 

 3  showed no change, you know, four years showed no 

 4  change, six years showed no change.

 5      Q.  That's empirical, right?  You're looking at 

 6  two different studies and seeing no changes?  

 7      A.  Correct.

 8      Q.  Right?

 9      A.  Correct.

10      Q.  That's not what we are talking about here.  

11  We are talking about you giving an opinion as to if 

12  you go back in time what his cervical spine and a 

13  related MRI would look like.  And I'm asking you how 

14  long back in time can you make that, give that 

15  opinion with a reasonable basis?

16      A.  So again, my opinion is based on my 

17  experience, right?  I can't point to an MRI that was 

18  done before the accident, because I didn't review 

19  one.  

20          But based on all my experience and my 

21  expertise, I can tell you that, generally speaking, 

22  we do see age-related changes progress over twenty 

23  years.  We see them progress over ten years.  

24  Obviously, over ten years, there tends to be less 


                                                               57

 1  progression than there is over twenty years.  

 2          That's, again, logical.  But I mean I can 

 3  think of several examples where I can tell you --

 4      Q.  I don't want examples.  I'm just wondering 

 5  how -- I'm wondering how far back in time you can 

 6  go, spin the clock back and give opinions based on 

 7  Mr. Miller's cervical spine.  That's all.  

 8      A.  Well, again, I reviewed a single MRI of 

 9  Mr. Miller -- 

10      Q.  Right.  Only one, right?

11      A.  Right.

12      Q.  In time?

13      A.  Right.  And based --

14      Q.  And you didn't review -- you didn't 

15  physically examine him or see any other records, 

16  correct?

17      A.  Correct.

18      Q.  Okay.

19      A.  Which we have already established.

20      Q.  Right.

21      A.  So just to be clear, I reviewed an MRI of 

22  the cervical spine that was done a few months after 

23  the accident.  It showed no traumatic injury of any 

24  kind.  It showed no aggravation of any traumatic -- 


                                                               58

 1  of any age-related change of any kind.  

 2          All the findings were these characteristic, 

 3  typical age-related changes that we see in the 

 4  cervical spine.  And the reason I can say that to 

 5  you is not just because I reviewed one MRI of the 

 6  cervical spine.  It's because in my career, I have 

 7  literally reviewed hundreds of thousands of cervical 

 8  spine MRIs.  

 9          And it's on that same basis, that same logic 

10  that I derive from my experience, right, that I can 

11  tell you that if, hypothetically, not literally, 

12  because there isn't a cervical spine MRI that 

13  predates this accident that I looked at.  But, 

14  hypothetically, if there had been, I would bet that 

15  the findings would be the same.  

16          Now, if I wasn't comfortable making that 

17  type of a conclusion, I wouldn't make it.  The 

18  reason I am comfortable making that type of a 

19  conclusion is because in my experience, based on the 

20  fact that there is no traumatic injury soon after 

21  the accident, and all of these findings or chronic 

22  and degenerative, and I'm confident with that, that 

23  if there had, hypothetically, been a study, it would 

24  look the same.  


                                                               59

 1          Because all of the age-related changes 

 2  predate this accident.  And that's the same type of 

 3  analysis that we did with the shoulder, where we do 

 4  have two MRIs.  So that's what I'm telling you.  So 

 5  literally did I compare two MRIs of the cervical 

 6  spine?  Absolutely not.  

 7      Q.  We know that.  We know that, because we are 

 8  here and we know there is no other MRI exists.  I 

 9  was just trying to get a time frame on how long you 

10  can actually give that opinion with a reasonable 

11  degree of medical certainty.  

12          I don't think we are going to reach an 

13  answer.  You have been unable to give me an answer 

14  as to that.  So we'll move on.  I get it.  You can 

15  speculate as to prior MRIs that don't exist and you 

16  don't need the reports.  It all comes with your 

17  experience.  I get it, Doctor.  

18          Now, you are not disputing that there's any 

19  herniations in the cervical spine, correct?

20      A.  If I look back at my report, there was a 

21  protrusion-type herniation at C6-7.  

22      Q.  Okay.  And there was also -- was there any 

23  other protrusions that you found, Doctor?

24      A.  No.


                                                               60

 1      Q.  And for the record, can you describe for the 

 2  jury what is a herniation?

 3      A.  So herniation actually has a specific 

 4  medical definition.  It refers to the shape of an 

 5  intervertebral disc in the spine.  So imagine a 

 6  normal intervertebral disc has, you know, a donut 

 7  shape to it roughly.  It's an oval.  

 8          So a bulge, for example, is any outpouching 

 9  of that disc that is more than 180 degrees.  So more 

10  than half of the entire circumference of the disc.  

11  A herniation is a more focal outpouching of that 

12  disc.  

13          Now, bulges and herniations, those are the 

14  definitions.  Those definitions have nothing to do 

15  with whether a bulge is traumatic or degenerative or 

16  a herniation is traumatic or degenerative.  All 

17  those definitions refer to is whether, you know, the 

18  shape of a disc is a bulge or a herniation.  That's 

19  it.  

20          The fact of the matter is that both bulges 

21  and herniations can be degenerative or traumatic.  

22  And if you just look at most of the people in the 

23  world, most bulges and herniations are, in fact, 

24  degenerative.  And the reason is because everybody 


                                                               61

 1  develops age-related changes in their spine and 

 2  relatively few people develop traumatic injuries of 

 3  their spine, thankfully.  

 4          But certainly bulges and herniations can be 

 5  traumatic as well.  In this particular case, I just 

 6  want to be very clear.  There were no traumatic 

 7  changes exhibited in any of the discs, including the 

 8  disc where there did happen to be a degenerative 

 9  herniation.  

10          And so yes, there is a herniation at C6-7, 

11  but that herniation is degenerative.  It's chronic.  

12  It predates this accident.  It has nothing to do 

13  with this accident.

14      Q.  Doctor, when it comes to herniations, that 

15  injury, whether chronic or -- 

16      A.  It's not an injury.  It's not an injury.

17      Q.  That condition, whether chronic or 

18  traumatic, correct, will that go back to its normal 

19  condition afterwards, or herniation, will it remain 

20  as is?

21      A.  So that's a good question.  So herniations, 

22  a small subset of them will actually continue to 

23  change shape.  Most of them get bigger.  Some stay 

24  the same.  And a small fraction of them actually 


                                                               62

 1  will over time get smaller.  And that has nothing, 

 2  again, to do with whether they are traumatic or 

 3  degenerative.

 4      Q.  Right.  That was my question. 

 5      A.  That's just period.

 6      Q.  Yeah.

 7      A.  Yeah.  Herniations -- like any other tissue 

 8  in the body, herniations can change shape and 

 9  morphology as time goes on.

10                  MR. SPEZIALI:  No further questions, 

11          Doctor.

15  BY MR. LAVIN:  

16      Q.  All right.  Dr. Dheer, if someone were 

17  asymptomatic and then had a traumatic injury and 

18  became symptomatic, would you expect to be able to 

19  find something on the diagnostic imaging?

20      A.  Of course.  So if somebody claims that, you 

21  know, they had no pain and now they have pain, there 

22  has to be something to account for that at the, you 

23  know, the physical level in the physical universe 

24  that we live in.  There has to be something to 


                                                               63

 1  account for that.  

 2          And certainly we see that.  You know, we see 

 3  traumatic injuries that have developed in people 

 4  that account for, you know, a change in symptoms.  

 5  Absolutely.  But again, if there is no such finding 

 6  on the MRI, there is nothing to account for a change 

 7  in symptom.

 8      Q.  All right.  And then similarly, you 

 9  indicated that someone could have a pre-existing 

10  protrusion or bulge and have a new superimposed 

11  injury on top of that injury, correct? 

12      A.  Yes, correct. 

13      Q.  Did you find that here?

14      A.  No, no.  Again, there was no traumatic or 

15  recent or acute type of change anywhere in the right 

16  shoulder or the cervical spine that could be 

17  attributed to, you know, the events-in-question 

18  here.  

19          Everything was, you know, had been there for 

20  a very long time.  It was chronic.  It had been 

21  there for a long time.  It was degenerative, meaning 

22  it was age-related.  It represented, you know, just 

23  wear-and-tear of the spine in a progressive fashion 

24  over many years.  And there was nothing in addition 


                                                               64

 1  to that or on top of that.

 2      Q.  All right.  And I want to clarify something, 

 3  because it was talked about for a while on cross-

 4  examination.  Why do you not need to read the 

 5  reading radiologist's report?

 6      A.  I mean the short answer is that that's what 

 7  I do, right?  So I mean how valuable would I be as 

 8  an expert if I needed somebody else's report to tell 

 9  me what the images showed?  

10          I think my value is that I look at a set of 

11  images without any external bias or influence.  And 

12  I generate an opinion of what those images show.  I 

13  guess it keeps me fair, right?  So yes.

14      Q.  Have any of the plaintiff's attorney's 

15  questions caused you to alter or change the opinions 

16  that are detailed in your report?

17      A.  No.

18      Q.  All right.  When you review MRI films, do 

19  you do so objectively?

20      A.  Yes.

21      Q.  After reviewing plaintiff's film and being 

22  cross-examined by plaintiff's counsel, what is your 

23  ultimate opinion to a reasonable degree of medical 

24  certainty?


                                                               65

 1      A.  That there is no traumatic injuries or 

 2  traumatic aggravation of any kind in the right 

 3  shoulder or the cervical spine.

 4                  MR. LAVIN:  Thank you, Dr. Dheer.

 8  BY MR. SPEZIALI:  

 9      Q.  And Doctor, you mentioned about your 

10  objective, being objective and being fair.  Just to 

11  be clear for the jury, you're here at the behest and 

12  on behalf of defense counsel's office, correct?

13      A.  That is correct.

14      Q.  And you are being paid by them for your time 

15  and your opinions here today, correct? 

16      A.  For my time, not my opinions, regardless of 

17  what my opinions may be. 

18      Q.  Right.  And the work you did on this case, 

19  correct? 

20      A.  Correct.

21                  MR. SPEZIALI:  Okay.  No further 

22          questions.

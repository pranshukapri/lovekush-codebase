          15   BY MS. NOSARI:

          16   Q.     Good morning.  My name is Katherine Nosari, and I

          17   represent the defendant in this action.  I'm gonna be

          18   taking your deposition today.  Have you ever had your

          19   deposition taken before?

          20   A.     When I served in a jury.

          21   Q.     Well, this is just gonna be a question-and-answer

          22   session on the record.  I'm gonna be asking you questions,

          23   and you'll be giving me responses.  Make sure you wait

          24   until the interpreter interprets the question completely

          25   before you start answering.  We don't want to talk over
                                                                      5



           1   each other at any point today.

           2                  There is a court reporter here.  He is

           3   writing down everything we say, so just make sure you

           4   verbalize all your responses.  You can't shake your head,

           5   shrug your shoulders, or say things like "uh-huh,"

           6   "uh-uh."  Say "yes" or "no" so it's a verbal thing he can

           7   hear and write down.

           8   A.     Correct.

           9   Q.     If you are asked any question today that you would

          10   like me to repeat or to rephrase, you didn't hear it or

          11   understand it completely, please let me know.  I'll be

          12   happy to do that.

          13   A.     Yes.

          14   Q.     When you answer one of my questions, I'm gonna be

          15   -- I'm gonna assume you heard it and you understood it, so

          16   just, of course, let me know if you don't.

          17                  Today when I'm asking questions, if I ask

          18   something that you do not know the answer to or you do not

          19   remember the answer to, as long as that's a truthful

          20   response, just let me know that.  We don't want you to

          21   guess at any point today.

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     And do you understand today that you were put under

          24   oath and it -- it's the same oath you would take if you

          25   were testifying in front of a judge or a jury?
                                                                      6



           1   A.     Yes.

           2   Q.     Today, have you -- oh.  One more instruction.  If

           3   you do want to take a break for any reason -- you're

           4   uncomfortable, you need to walk around, you need to use

           5   the restroom, whatever the reason may be -- just let us

           6   know that and we can take a break.

           7   A.     Yes.

           8   Q.     Today, have you taken any medication or substance

           9   that would impair your ability to understand my questions

          10   and respond truthfully?

          11   A.     No.

           1   A.     Less.

           2   Q.     Were you paid for that, you know, couple weeks, it

           3   sounds like, few weeks?  Did you like get paid at all,

           4   take any sick time, leave time that you were paid for?

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     So that would all have been unpaid leave?

           7   A.     No.

           8   Q.     It wasn't unpaid?

           9   A.     No.

          10   Q.     Let me clarify.  With Godiva, did you have leave,

          11   meaning paid leave you could take, vacation and sick

          12   leave?

          13   A.     No.

          14   Q.     And what -- did you work full-time or part-time?

          15   A.     Full-time.

          16   Q.     At least 40 hours a week?

          17   A.     Sometimes, yes.  Sometimes, no.  Sometimes, work is

          18   a little lazy, so...

          19   Q.     So it was approximately 40 hours a week?

          20   A.     Yes.

          21   Q.     And they didn't have to provide you any paid leave

          22   as part of your employment?

          23   A.     No.  Because there were like a few days I didn't

          24   bother with the unemployment, because it was not worth it.

          25   Q.     Oh.  You didn't apply for unemployment?
                                                                     12



           1   A.     No.

           2   Q.     Did you ever -- strike that.  So when you went back

           3   to work after that few weeks --

           4                  MR. TIMONEY:  Just to clarify, I'm -- I

           5   don't know -- when she says she missed days from work, I

           6   don't know if it's consecutive days making a week.

           7                  MS. NOSARI:  Oh, okay.  Let me ask that.

           8                  MR. TIMONEY:  Right.  'Cause I think part

           9   of it is doctors' appointments, this and that.  So --

          10                  MS. NOSARI:  Oh, okay.

          11                  MR. TIMONEY:  That's what I think.

          12                  MS. NOSARI:  I understand.

          13   BY MS. NOSARI:

          14   Q.     So my original question, I was asking whether you

          15   missed -- when I asked whether you missed time from work,

          16   I guess I meant whether you missed consecutive days from

          17   work, meaning days back to back.  Is that what you missed,

          18   or did you miss days sporadically?

          19   A.     Like that one, one here, another day there.

          20   Q.     And what were the reasons why you would miss work,

          21   those -- those days sporadically?

          22   A.     Because I didn't feel well.

          23   Q.     And by "not feel well," is that -- do you mean not

          24   feel well from injuries you're saying are from this

          25   accident?
                                                                     13

           5   A.     No.

           6   Q.     Now, with your job, did you have to like check in

           7   in the morning and then check out when you left?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     And did you have a regular schedule back when the

          10   accident occurred?  You worked certain days of the week?

           1   Q.     And when you left in June or July of 2018, was that

           2   because of a doctor's instruction to stop working or your

           3   own personal choice to stop working?

           4   A.     It was my option.  Because I had too much pain in

           5   my neck, I really couldn't deal with it.  It was too much.

           6   Q.     And were you working in any other capacity since --

          15   A.     I had to drive her because she had a lot of medical

          16   appointments, make her bed, help her with the medicine,

          17   and help her with her meals.

          18   Q.     Like cook?

          19   A.     Yes.  She would cook but I would help her.

           1   injuries you're saying are from this accident?

           1   but they were never 40.

           2   Q.     And I imagine with that, you would submit time

           3   sheets to Maxim to show when you would get there and when

           4   you would leave, how much you would work?

           5   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     And just so I'm -- so I make sure to be fair and

          25   where you were driving a car, a passenger in a car, on a
                                                                     20

          13   2017, were you under the care -- well, actually, let me

          14   make it -- make it a little clearer.  Shortly prior to

          15   this accident occurring, so prior to April 8th, 2017, were

          16   you under the care of any doctor for any ongoing pain

          17   complaints to any parts of your body?

          18   A.     I have only received due to the arthritis in the

           1   A.     It's not that long.  It's just pretty recent that I

           2   began the treatment for the knee.

           3   Q.     So did you have any right knee pain or complaints

           4   to your right knee before this accident of April 8th,

          24   therapy.

          25   Q.     And those were two injections in your right knee?
                                                                     24

          23   Q.     I think I saw in some of the medical records that

          24   you had a past medical history of migraines.  Is that

          25   accurate?
                                                                     25

          13                  THE WITNESS:  I always had issues with

          14   headaches but nothing -- nothing that strong like now.

          15   BY MS. NOSARI:

          16   Q.     Did you ever have any specific treatment for

          17   migraines like you were on specific medication or they did

          18   specific therapy or gave you -- sometimes they do

          19   injections into the head.

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     And are you alleging an increase or an aggravation

          22   of your migraines from this accident?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     And how were your migraines made worse?

          25   A.     Well, my head now hurts daily.  And I also get pain
                                                                     26



           1   in my neck, and that really bothers my neck.  And I also

           2   get nauseous.

           3   Q.     How often were you getting headaches or migraines

           4   prior to this accident occurring?

           5   A.     My migraines were under control.

           6   Q.     So how often did that mean?  How often did you

           7   experience them?

           8   A.     But now -- but now my head hurts a lot more, like

           9   almost daily.

          10   Q.     But I'm wondering what -- I want to know your

          11   baseline, so I'm wondering how it was before the accident,

          12   how often.

          13   A.     Well, it would hurt, yes, but it wouldn't last as

          14   many hours.  And I would just go and take a painkiller,

          15   and it would go away.  Now, I can't even get rid of them

          16   with the painkillers.

          17   Q.     But again, how many times, let's say a week or a

          18   month, however -- if you can approximate, how -- how often

          19   you would get a headache prior -- before this accident

          20   occurred?

          21   A.     Like two times a week or three times a month.

          22   Q.     That's -- that's a lot different, two times a week

          23   or three times a month.

          24   A.     I don't remember.  I don't remember.

          25   Q.     Were you -- did -- are you -- would you say -- is
                                                                     27



           1   it your testimony that you were not getting them daily

           2   before this accident occurred?

           3   A.     Right.

           4   Q.     And did you ever have any nausea when you would

           5   have migraines before this accident occurred?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     And you mentioned you would take pain medication

           8   that would relieve your headaches before the accident.  So

           9   what were you taking?

          10   A.     Ibuprofen.

          11   Q.     Just over the counter?

          12   A.     It was prescribed.

          13   Q.     And do you recall the doctor that prescribed it?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     Could -- would it have been your primary care

          16   doctor?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Dr. Arias?

          19   A.     No.

          20   Q.     Well, then who?

          21   A.     I don't remember the name, because he left where I

          22   was going.

          23   Q.     Do you remember what kind of doctor he or she was?

          24   A.     It's in -- I just don't remember the name.

          25   Q.     Is that something you would be able to look up or
                                                                     28



           1   have at home or ask someone?

           2   A.     Yes.

           3   Q.     Again, could you find that out and give it to your

           4   attorney, and he'll give it to me.

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Thank you.

           7                  All right.  Let's talk about the accident.

          14   about in terms of ways your life was affected?

          15   A.     Like cooking.  Picking up things from the ground, I

          16   really can't, so I have to have them on a higher spot like

          17   on the table.

          18   Q.     So like bending over bothers you?

           3   affected?

           5   well, I have no desire to cook.

           6   Q.     Does someone have to cook for you?

           7   A.     My daughter sends meals or my husband tries to do

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Does that mean it would take you a while to fall

          20   asleep, or you just slept more?

          21   A.     I -- I would struggle sleeping.

          22   Q.     Like struggle to fall asleep?

          23   A.     Yes.

          24   Q.     And why was that?

           1   Q.     And so now, are you saying you wake up a lot?  Like

           2   how is the sleeping different?

           3   A.     It has been affected because I take pills.  And

           4   despite the pills, I'm not able to sleep.

           5   Q.     You just can't fall -- it takes you longer to fall

          10   A.     I don't know.  Something you want to ask?

          11   Q.     Well, were you involved in any other social

          12   activities or have any other hobbies or interests that you

          13   had to stop doing or you can't do as often?

          14   A.     Right.  I don't go anywhere.

          15   Q.     Well, was there something you were doing prior to

          13   you.

          14                  MR. TIMONEY:  I just have a few questions

          15   to clarify some things.

          17   Q.     Before the accident, were you treating with

          23   A.     The stomach, I would get pills so I could stand the

          24   pain, for the medicine that I was getting for the pain.

          25   Q.     So -- but I'm trying to understand what's -- what
                                                                     58



           1   was different after the accident about your stomach, if

           5   stomach.

          16   like that as a result of the accident?

          17   A.     Yes.  I -- I cut hair as a profession.  I used to

          18   do my hair as well as my daughter's in the past or even my

          19   girlfriends', but I can no longer do that.

          20   Q.     Why -- why not?

          21   A.     Because when I hold on to the blow-dryer, my arm

          22   gets tired.  It just drops down.

         17    BY MR. HESS:

         18         Q.  Mr. Spohn, my name is Bruce Hess.

         19    I represent the Plaintiff in a case that

         20    he brought against you for injuries

         21    resulting from a motor vehicle accident on

         22    December 30th, 2016 on Route 309 around

         23    Quakertown.  I'm going to ask you a

         24    series of questions that pertain to this

                                 David Spohn             5



          1    case.

          2             Have you ever testified before

          3    in court or at a deposition?

          4         A.  No.

          5         Q.  All right.  There's several rules

          6    I want you to follow during the course of

          7    your deposition.  I don't anticipate we'll

          8    be here long.

          9             First of all, obviously, tell the

         10    truth.  Number two, this is done on a

         11    question and answer basis, so I ask a

         12    question, you give an answer.  I ask a

         13    question, you give an answer.  Try and wait

         14    for me to finish my question before you

         15    answer, and I will try and wait for you to

         16    finish your answer before I ask another

         17    question.  In other words, the court

         18    reporter can't take down both of us talking

         19    at the same time.

         20             If you do not understand a

         21    question, please ask me to rephrase it, and

         22    I'll be happy to do that.  If you answer a

         23    question, I will assume that you understood

         24    the question.  If a question calls for a

                                 David Spohn             6



          1    yes or no answer, say "yes" or say "no."

          2    Don't shake or nod your head.

          3             If at any time you want to take a

          4    break, talk to your lawyer, use the

          5    bathroom, whatever.  That's perfectly okay.

          6    Just let me know.  Okay?

          7         A.  Okay.

          8         Q.  Lastly, is there any reason that

          9    you can't testify truthfully or honestly

         10    today because of illness, medication or

         11    otherwise?

         12         A.  No.

         13         Q.  State your full name, please.

         14         A.  David Matthew Spohn.

         15         Q.  And where do you live at the

         16    present time?

         17         A.  308 Ashford Lane in Hereford,

         18    PA.

         19         Q.  And how long have you lived

         20    there?

         21         A.  I will be there approximately

         22    12 years.

         23         Q.  What is your marital status?

         24         A.  I'm married.

         13    street, but yeah.

         14         Q.  Okay.  Do you recall what the

         15    weather was like at the time?

         16         A.  I know it was cold.  No snow, no

         17    rain.  Sunny, probably.

         19    Friday; do you recall that sitting here

         20    today?

                                 David Spohn            10



          1         Q.  And what hours did you work that

          2    day?

          3         A.  From 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.

          4         Q.  And at 11:00 a.m., you were done

          5    working for the rest of the day?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  And was that a normal shift, to

          8    work four hours?

          9         A.  No.  It was an early day for the

         10    holiday, the upcoming holiday.

         11         Q.  So you worked in Pottstown that

         12    morning?

         13         A.  Yes.

         14         Q.  And what did you do from there?

         15         A.  I left my employer.  I went to a

         16    financial institution in Quakertown where I

         17    have a loan, and then I was heading to

         18    Telford to look for another job at the

         19    time.  I didn't realize they closed early

         20    that day, and proceeded to head back to my

         21    residence when the accident occurred.

         22         Q.  How far did you live from the

         23    location where the accident happened,

         24    approximately, either in my miles or travel

                                 David Spohn            11



          1    time?

          2         A.  I don't know.

          3         Q.  I mean, were you 10 minutes away,

          4    15 minutes away?

          5         A.  If I have to make an

          6    approximation, probably 20 minutes maybe.

          7         Q.  Okay.  So at the time of the

          8    accident, you were heading home?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  Now, at the time of the accident,

         11    were you familiar with the location where

         12    the accident happened, and I mean Route

         13    309, in that vicinity?

         14         A.  Not really.  I wasn't, no.

         15         Q.  And what do you mean by "not

         16    really?"

         17         A.  I traveled through that area

         18    before not knowing that -- like, I don't

         19    know it to the best of my knowledge.

         20         Q.  I mean, had you ever proceeded

         21    southbound on 309 where this accident

         22    happened before the day of the accident?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  Okay.  And do you recall how many

                                 David Spohn            12



          1    times?

          2         A.  Not many.

          3         Q.  Do you remember the last time

          4    before the accident?

          5         A.  Wow.  Maybe a year or two before

          6    then, that portion of 309.

          7         Q.  Where this accident happened with

          8    the Plaintiff, were you familiar with how

          9    many lanes there were on Route 309?

         10         A.  When the accident occurred, I was

         11    not familiar with the third lane where the

         12    accident happened, which was the turn

         13    lane.

         14         Q.  Now, the intersecting road south

         15    of where the accident happened was called

         16    Station Road.  Do you know how far that

         17    was, Station Road, from where the impact of

         18    the accident happened?

         19         A.  I don't.  I know I could see the

         20    traffic light.

         21         Q.  Okay.  And it was controlled by

         22    traffic lights, that intersection?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  Now, it's my understanding you

          1    were exiting a parking lot at the time of

          2    the accident --

          3         A.  Yes.

          4         Q.  -- is that correct?

          5             Had you ever exited that parking

          6    lot before the date of this accident?

          7         A.  No.

          8         Q.  And what were you doing in that

          9    parking lot?

         10         A.  Turning around from heading to

         11    Telford.  I realized that the place was

         12    closed, where I was going, so I turned in

         13    that parking lot to do a U-turn and come

         14    out.  And I was in the lot, and it was

         15    congested traffic, so when they had stopped

         16    me, I came across the two lanes not

         17    realizing a third lane was there when he

         18    hit me.

         19         Q.  Did you stop at a store that was

         20    in that parking lot --

         21         A.  No.

         22         Q.  -- for any reason?

         23         A.  No.

         24         Q.  And I understand there's a

                                 David Spohn            14



          1    Peruzzi's in that vicinity; is that

          2    correct?

          3         A.  I think.  It sounds familiar.

          4         Q.  And there's an adult store

          5    there.  You didn't stop at either of those

          6    stores?

          7         A.  No, I didn't.

          8         Q.  So you didn't get out of your car

          9    in that parking lot; you were just turning

         10    around?

         11         A.  Yes.

         12         Q.  And it was your intention on

         13    exiting that parking lot to cross the

         14    southbound lanes of Route 309, and turn

         15    left on northbound 309; is that correct?

         16         A.  That's correct.  Yes.

         17         Q.  Okay.

         18               MR. HESS:  Mark these as

         19         Spohn-1 and 2.

          1    BY MR. HESS:

          2         Q.  Mr. Spohn, I'm showing you two

          3    photographs -- one is an aerial photograph,

          4    and the other is a ground photograph --

          5    and ask if you're familiar with what these

          6    photographs show?  And they're marked

          7    Spohn-1 and Spohn-2.

          8         A.  No.  I'm not familiar with them.

          9         Q.  On Spohn-2, there shows an Adult

         10    World sign there.  Does that refresh your

         11    memory as to what this is a photograph

         12    of?

         13         A.  That's the parking lot I turned

         14    around in.

         15         Q.  Okay.  Are you able, looking at

         16    either photograph, to mark where you exited

         17    from the parking lot in an effort to cross

         18    the southbound lanes?

         19         A.  Probably right around here

         20    (indicating).

         21         Q.  Can you put an X there?

         22         A.  (The witness complies.)

         23               MR. HESS:  So, the

         24         Defendant has put an "X" on a

          1         driveway which exits the parking

          2         lot which he was exiting at the

          3         time of the accident.

          4    BY MR. HESS:

          5         Q.  Do either of these photographs

          6    show where the impact with the Plaintiff's

          7    car occurred?

          8         A.  In this turn lane (indicating).

          9         Q.  Okay.  Can you, on Spohn-2, give

         10    me -- draw a line showing the path of

         11    travel of your car before impact?

         12         A.  Do you want me to, like, put an

         13    arrow?

         14         Q.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just draw a line

         15    with an arrow.

         16         A.  (The witness complies.)

         17         Q.  So that line you've drawn across

         18    Spohn-2 indicates your path of travel up

         19    until the time of impact; is that

         20    correct?

         21         A.  Yes.

         22         Q.  Now, this photograph shows two

         23    lanes of travel, two southbound lanes that

         24    you crossed, correct?

                                 David Spohn            17



          1         A.  Yes.

          2         Q.  And the impact happened in the

          3    left-hand turn lane for Route 309 south,

          4    correct?

          5         A.  That's correct.

          6         Q.  Do you see these double lines here

          7    that separate southbound and northbound

          8    traffic?

          9         A.  Yes.

         10         Q.  Did you see those lines before the

         11    impact that day?

         12         A.  Can you rephrase the question?

         13         Q.  Yeah.  Sure.

         14             Would you agree with me that

         15    these two lines shown in Spohn-2 separate

         16    northbound traffic from southbound

         17    traffic?

         18         A.  Yes.

         19         Q.  Do you recall seeing those two

         20    lines that day before the accident

         21    happened?

         22         A.  Yes.

         23         Q.  All right.  And when did you first

         24    see those double yellow lines?  Was is it

                                 David Spohn            18



          1    before the impact, or was it after?

          2         A.  It was before.

          3         Q.  And how much sooner -- how much

          4    prior to the accident did you see those --

          5    or let me rephrase it.

          6             Where was your car when you first

          7    noticed those yellow lines?

          8         A.  I was here in the lot

          9    (indicating).  The traffic was congested.

         10    They had -- these two lanes of traffic had

         11    stopped, and they -- both lanes had waived

         12    me to come out that it was okay.  And when

         13    I came across this lane of traffic, I saw

         14    this yellow line proceeded into this lane

         15    in front of him.

         16         Q.  All right.  So before you crossed

         17    the two lanes, the two through lanes, for

         18    southbound traffic, is it your testimony

         19    that you saw this double yellow line?

         20         A.  I saw the yellow line when I

         21    cleared these two lanes of traffic and as

         22    soon as I entered into that turn lane.

         23         Q.  I'm sorry.  Maybe I'm not phrasing

         24    it right.  Where was your car the first

                                 David Spohn            19



          1    time that you saw these double yellow

          2    lines; where was it that day?

          3         A.  Probably in this lane here

          4    (indicating), the two second passing

          5    lane.  Yeah, the second lane of traffic

          6    here.

          7         Q.  The second through lane?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  All right.  And when you saw those

         10    double yellow lines, did that indicate to

         11    you that there was actually another turning

         12    lane for southbound traffic?

         13         A.  No.

         14         Q.  And why not?

         15         A.  I don't understand what you

         16    mean.

         17         Q.  When you saw these double yellow

         18    lines, didn't that indicate to you that

         19    that separated southbound from northbound

         20    traffic?

         21         A.  I don't -- I was unaware that

         22    there was a turn lane there when I came

         23    out.

         24         Q.  Okay.  Before you attempted to

                                 David Spohn            20



          1    cross the southbound lanes of Route 309,

          2    how would you describe traffic on 309 at

          3    that time?  In other words, was it light,

          4    moderate or heavy?

          5         A.  Very congested.  Very heavy.

          6         Q.  When did you first notice, if at

          7    all, the color of the traffic light at the

          8    intersection with Station Road?  Was that

          9    before you exited the parking lot or

         10    after?

         11         A.  I didn't notice the color of the

         12    traffic light.

         13         Q.  Okay.  Just before you exited the

         14    parking lot, had the traffic in front of

         15    you for southbound 309 stopped?

         16         A.  They had stopped and gave me an

         17    opening to come out, and when I proceeded

         18    through, I went into the turn lane where he

         19    hit me.

         20         Q.  And the opening was created by

         21    vehicles in both of the through lanes?

         22         A.  Correct.  Yup.

         23         Q.  Did anybody wave you on to cross

         24    in front of them?

                                 David Spohn            21



          1         A.  Both drivers in both lanes did.

          2         Q.  With a hand gesture?

          3         A.  Yes.

          4         Q.  Were there any vehicles stopped

          5    behind them at that time?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  In what you now know as the

          8    left-hand turn lane as shown in those

          9    photos, did you see any vehicles moving in

         10    that lane before you started to cross?

         11         A.  I didn't.

         12         Q.  It's my understanding the

         13    collision happened in the left-turn lane on

         14    southbound 309; is that correct?

         15         A.  Yes.

         16         Q.  Do you know what your speed was at

         17    the time of impact?

         18         A.  I don't recall.

         19         Q.  Do you know if your foot was on

         20    the gas or on the brake petal at the time

         21    of the impact?

         22         A.  I was on the gas, but it wasn't --

         23    I don't know my speed.

         24         Q.  Do you know if your vehicle was

                                 David Spohn            22



          1    accelerating at the time of the impact?

          2         A.  I'm going to say yes.

          3         Q.  Before you started to exit the

          4    parking lot until the time of impact, at

          5    any time did you look to your right or to

          6    your left?

          7         A.  I looked to my right, I looked to

          8    my left, and then I looked back to my right

          9    and proceeded out.

         10         Q.  So you looked to your right, your

         11    left and your right before you started to

         12    exit the parking lot?

         13         A.  I looked to my right, I looked to

         14    my left, and I pulled out.  And I looked to

         15    my right and proceeded across the two

         16    lanes, and didn't look to my left.  And got

         17    into the lane, and he was there.

         18         Q.  Okay.  So you looked to your left

         19    once before you started to exit --

         20         A.  Yes.

         21         Q.  -- the parking lot; and then

         22    after you exited the parking lot, you

         23    looked to your right, but not to your left

         24    again?

                                 David Spohn            23



          1         A.  Correct.

          2         Q.  Did you ever see the Plaintiff's

          3    vehicle before impact?

          4         A.  I did not.

          5         Q.  All right.  At the time of the

          6    accident, were you aware of the speed limit

          7    for 309 at that location?

          8         A.  Yes.

          9         Q.  And what was it?

         10         A.  40, I believe.  It was no more

         11    than 40, I believe.

         12         Q.  Once you had crossed the two

         13    through lanes on 309 southbound, were you

         14    then in the process of turning left when

         15    the impact happened?

         16         A.  Was I in the process of turning?

         17    Uh, I think I was going more straight to

         18    turn left.

         19         Q.  Well, once you had crossed those

         20    two through lanes, you now assumed that

         21    your vehicle was in the northbound lane,

         22    correct?

         23         A.  I don't understand how -- can you

         24    rephrase it?

                                 David Spohn            24



          1         Q.  Well, you thought that there were

          2    only two lanes southbound --

          3         A.  Correct.

          4         Q.  -- at that location at the time of

          5    the accident, correct?

          6         A.  Yes.

          7         Q.  So once your vehicle entered the

          8    third lane, I assume that you thought you

          9    were now entering the northbound --

         10         A.  Yes.

         11         Q.  Okay.  Where were you looking at

         12    the time of the accident?

         13         A.  Straight into the northbound lane

         14    to make my turn.

         15         Q.  You were looking straight ahead?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17         Q.  Your headlights, were they on or

         18    off; do you recall?

         19         A.  I don't recall.

         20         Q.  Your vehicle, when you start it

         21    up, do the headlights just go on

         22    automatically?  Did you have it set that

         23    way?

         24         A.  No.

          1         Q.  You did not?

          2         A.  No, I did not.

          3         Q.  Okay.  When you were crossing the

          4    southbound lanes of 309 in order to turn

          5    left, did you consider that action

          6    dangerous?

          7         A.  Yes, I did.

          8         Q.  And why was that?

          9         A.  Because of the heavy volume of

         10    traffic.

         11         Q.  Did you know if it was illegal to

         12    do what you were doing?

         13         A.  No, I did not.

         14         Q.  Okay.

         15               MR. HESS:  START mark that

         16         3 and 4.

         22    BY MR. HESS:

         23         Q.  Mr. Spohn, I'm showing you two

         24    photographs marked as Spohn-3 and

                                 David Spohn            26



          1    Spohn-4.  They show two different vehicles.

          2    Can you identify either one of those

          3    vehicles?

          4         A.  Yes.  Number 3 is my vehicle.

          5         Q.  And does Number 3 show the damage

          6    that was caused by the accident with the

          7    Plaintiff?

          8         A.  Yes, it does.

          9         Q.  And that damage, it looks like

         10    it's confined to the driver's side front?

         11         A.  Yes.

         12         Q.  Okay.  Can you identify what is

         13    shown in Spohn-4 at all?

         14         A.  I believe it's the Plaintiff's

         15    vehicle.

         16         Q.  Did you have an opportunity to

         17    look at the damage to his vehicle after the

         18    accident?

         19         A.  I did not.

         20         Q.  Did you have a cell phone with you

         21    at the time of the accident?

         22         A.  I did.

         23         Q.  Were you using your cell phone

         24    for any purpose at the time of the

                                 David Spohn            27



          1    accident?

          2         A.  I was not.

          3         Q.  Where was the cell phone located

          4    in the vehicle at the time of the

          5    accident?

          6         A.  It was in my console.

          7         Q.  Describe what happened at the

          8    scene after the accident occurred.

          9         A.  I had gotten out of my vehicle.  I

         10    had checked the damage on my vehicle.

         11    There was, I believe, a volunteer

         12    firefighter that had gotten there, like,

         13    right away.  He had stopped all traffic and

         14    notified the police, and then I proceeded

         15    over to the Plaintiff's vehicle and walked

         16    back to my car.

         17         Q.  And then what happened?

         18         A.  Then I was just waiting for the

         19    arriving of the police.  And I had made a

         20    phone call to my wife at the time letting

         21    her know that I was involved in an accident

         22    and was going to have to find a ride to get

         23    her home from work, because she doesn't

         24    have a driver's license, and waited until

                                 David Spohn            28



          1    the police arrived.

          2         Q.  Were you injured in this

          3    accident?

          4         A.  I was not.

          5         Q.  Did you have an opportunity to

          6    speak to the Plaintiff at the scene of the

          7    accident?

          8         A.  No, I didn't.

          9         Q.  Did you make any observations

         10    about him at the scene of the accident?

         11         A.  I didn't, no.  I did not.

         12         Q.  Did you see him get out of the

         13    vehicle or stay in the vehicle, or --

         14         A.  I didn't see him get out of the

         15    vehicle.

         16         Q.  Did an ambulance ever arrive at

         17    the scene?

         18         A.  Yes, it did.

         19         Q.  And did they take the Plaintiff?

         20         A.  I'm assuming they did.

         21         Q.  All right.  And was your vehicle

         22    towed from the scene?

         23         A.  Yes.

         24         Q.  And was it totaled as a result of

          1    the accident?

          2         A.  Could you say that again?

          3         Q.  Was your vehicle totaled as a

          4    result of the accident?

          5         A.  No, it wasn't.

          6         Q.  Okay.  So it was repaired?

          7         A.  Yes.

          8         Q.  Did you talk to anybody at the

          9    scene of the accident other than, perhaps,

         10    the police?

         11         A.  Just the volunteer firefighter

         12    that arrive shortly after the accident

         13    happened.

         14         Q.  And what did you talk to him

         15    about?

         16         A.  I just told him that it was my

         17    fault, and I had come out across the two

         18    lanes into the Plaintiff's path.  And then

         19    waited until the police arrived, and gave

         20    my statement to them.

         21         Q.  Okay.  Were you given any

         22    traffic ticket as a result of this

         23    accident?

         24         A.  No.

          1         Q.  Okay.

          2               MR. HESS:  Mark this as 5.

          7    BY MR. HESS:

          8         Q.  Mr. Spohn, do you recall giving a

          9    recorded statement to your insurance

         10    company after the accident?

         11         A.  I don't recall.

         12         Q.  I want to show you what's been

         13    marked Spohn-5.  They have you down as

         14    David "Stone" because it sounded like David

         15    Stone.  But I want you to take the

         16    opportunity to read through this, and then

         17    I'll be done.

         18         A.  (The witness complies.)

         21    BY MR. HESS:

         22         Q.  So, Mr. Spohn, I've given you

         23    what's been marked as Spohn-5, and it is a

         24    transcribed statement given by a person

                                 David Spohn            31



          1    identified as Dave Stone.  Do you

          2    recognize that as your statement to

          3    Progressive?

          4         A.  Yes.

          5         Q.  Is there anything in that

          6    statement, having read it just now, that is

          7    inaccurate or that needs to be corrected or

          8    amended?

          9         A.  Well, other than my last name, it

         10    has "Colt's Auto Body."  It was actually

         11    Kulp's Auto Body.  Other than that,

         12    everything looks like -- everything looks

         13    in order otherwise other than that.

         14         Q.  So other than those two

         15    corrections, everything is accurate?

         16         A.  Yes.

         17               MR. HESS:  Thank you.

         18         That's all I have auto.

         19               MR. LAVIN:  I have no

         20         questions.  Thank you.

         21               MR. HESS:  Thanks for your

         22         time.

         23               THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

               1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're on record.

               2               STEVEN R. BRUHL, M.D.,

               3             WHO, BEING FIRST DULY SWORN,

               4                 TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  And we have a continuing

               6  objection on behalf of the Defendants in regard to

               7  any testimony regarding patient outcomes.  And to

               8  the extent that patients are identified, we ask

               9  that they use their initials.

              10                     EXAMINATION

              11  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

              12          Q.   Okay.  Doctor, this is

              13  Jason Archinaco.  I'm at a different location

              14  than you, so if you have a difficulty hearing

              15  me for any reason, please let me know.

              16          A.   Sure.

              17          Q.   Can you please state your full

              18  name for the record?

              19          A.   Steven Richard Bruhl.

              20          Q.   And where are you currently

              21  employed?

              22          A.   Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital.

              23          Q.   And are you directly employed by

              24  that entity, Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital?

              25          A.   Yes.  I have actually multiple --



                                                                5


               1  I'm a chief medical officer of the hospital.

               2  CHP, which you may not care about, but as a

               3  sub -- it employs the physicians, but yes,

               4  it's all a Mercy Health entity.

               5          Q.   Okay.  What I was asking is,

               6  though, that your paycheck comes from Mercy

               7  Health-Tiffin Hospital?

               8          A.   Technically, from MHP, Mercy

               9  Health Physicians.  My CMO funds come from the

              10  hospital, but it doesn't say Mercy

              11  Health-Tiffin Hospital on it.

              12          Q.   Okay.  So your paycheck comes

              13  from Mercy, or your paycheck comes with Mercy

              14  Health Physicians on it?

              15          A.   That is my understanding,

              16  correct.

              17          Q.   And that's an entity that is

              18  related to Mercy?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   And who -- who else does that

              21  entity employ, to your knowledge?

              22          A.   Well, all employed physicians,

              23  there are just a handful in the hospital that

              24  I work at, but I mean, there is thousands of

              25  doctors that are employed by Mercy Health



                                                                6


               1  Physicians.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And I have a little

               3  background in -- in hospitals and things of

               4  that nature, so I do kind of understand what

               5  you're discussing.  But I do want to ask a

               6  couple more questions.

               7          A.   Sure.

               8          Q.   Essentially -- essentially, Mercy

               9  -- Mercy Health Physicians is a corporate

              10  entity that has contracts with physicians

              11  employed through the Mercy system; is that

              12  right?

              13          A.   I really have no insider

              14  information on the details of Mercy Health.  I

              15  know that I am employed by Mercy Health, but

              16  who they have other contracts with, I

              17  honestly, I'm not trying to be difficult, I

              18  just don't know the details of that.

              19          Q.   No, it's fair -- it's fair

              20  enough.  You may not know that, and I'm not --

              21  I don't want you to -- by the way, have you

              22  ever given your deposition before?

              23          A.   One other time as a Defendant for

              24  some -- as a fact witness for the case.

              25          Q.   Who was that, what kind of case?



                                                                7


               1             THE WITNESS:  No, I'm good.

               2          A.   It was kind of wrongful

               3  termination.  It was a private firm that, or a

               4  cardiology group that somebody got fired, and

               5  I was called as a character witness for the

               6  guy who was fired.

               7          Q.   So you testified on the

               8  terminated person's behalf --

               9          A.   That's correct.

              10          Q.   -- that he was wrongfully --

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   Now, just a couple of basic

              13  ground rules.  You're doing fine.  No nods and

              14  shakes of the heads.  The court reporter takes

              15  downs everything that is audible, so we just

              16  follow question, potential objection, and then

              17  answer.  If an objection is lodged by either

              18  counsel there, please let them finish the

              19  objection.  Normally, you can give an answer,

              20  unless you've been instructed not to answer.

              21             And also, I'm not asking for any

              22  attorney-client privilege information today.

              23  To the extent you had conversations with an

              24  attorney, I'm not asking about those.  I'm

              25  allowed to ask documents that you reviewed and



                                                                8


               1  things, but I'm not trying to get into

               2  questions about your conversations with

               3  counsel.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   And so if you answer -- also,

               6  finally, if you answer a question, I'm going

               7  to assume that you both heard and understood

               8  it, which is important, given we're at two

               9  different locations.  Is that all fair enough

              10  to you?

              11          A.   I understand.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And how long have you been

              13  employed through Mercy Health Physicians?

              14          A.   Little over eight years.

              15          Q.   And do you have any supervisor at

              16  Mercy -- Mercy Health Physicians that you

              17  report to?

              18          A.   I report to the CEO as my -- as a

              19  chief medical officer, and then I have a, kind

              20  of a practice supervisor, kind of, who

              21  oversees the practice.

              22          Q.   Is -- are those people employed

              23  by Mercy Health Physicians, to your knowledge?

              24          A.   My office manager is employed by

              25  Mercy Health Physicians.  The CEO is



                                                                9


               1  definitely not, as far as -- as far as I know

               2  anyway.

               3          Q.   And who is he -- and the CEO or

               4  --

               5          A.   CEO, the CEO.

               6          Q.   The CEO of Mercy Health-Tiffin

               7  Hospital?

               8          A.   That's correct.

               9          Q.   And who is he employed by, to

              10  your knowledge?

              11          A.   Mercy Health generic.  All -- the

              12  only entities I know is Mercy Health

              13  Physicians, which is the physician part, and

              14  then Mercy Health, the enterprise, but like I

              15  said, I don't really know the details of what

              16  her paycheck says, so to speak.

              17          Q.   And who is the CEO?

              18          A.   Lynn Detterman.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And I understand you're

              20  not a corporate representative today, Doctor,

              21  so we're just trying to get your best

              22  information.  It's fair --

              23          A.   Sure.

              24          Q.   That's fair enough.  I'm not

              25  asking you to speculate or guess today.



                                                               10


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  If the court

               2  reporter can mark as our next exhibit, which

               3  is the affidavit of Steven Bruhl.  This will

               4  be marked as Exhibit 122, I believe.

               5             THE REPORTER:  Yes.

               6             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 122

               7  was marked for identification.)

               8             THE REPORTER:  Okay.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, you

              10  have the affidavit before you?

              11          A.   Yes, I do.

              12          Q.   And is this your signature on

              13  page 3?

              14          A.   Yes, it is.

              15          Q.   And there is a notary public

              16  stamp.  Did you sign this in front of a

              17  notary?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   There is a date on here of

              20  August 14, 2018.  Do you belive that is the

              21  day that you did that?

              22          A.   I do believe so.

              23          Q.   You said you believe so?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Okay.  Who prepared the language



                                                               11


               1  that's in this affidavit?

               2          A.   I don't know exactly who typed

               3  it, if that's what you're asking, but I will

               4  give you the account of events as I understand

               5  them.  And that is that I was called by

               6  someone from Mercy Health.  I honestly have no

               7  idea who that was.  And informed me that there

               8  was a -- a lawsuit in relation to Dr. Holland

               9  and Mercy Health, and that the allegations

              10  were made that cardiologists, including

              11  myself, may have discriminated against him

              12  based on his race or ethnic origin, and they

              13  asked me whether that was true, that -- that I

              14  had discriminated against him, and I said no.

              15  And they said, well, why did you refer or not

              16  refer patients to Dr. Holland?  And I told

              17  them, you know, why.  And then at the end of

              18  that discussion, they said, okay, well, let me

              19  -- I have taken notes of this whole

              20  discussion.  Let me go ahead and put together

              21  what you've said, or I've understood what

              22  you've said.  You feel free to change that

              23  however you want to, take out, put in.  And

              24  once you feel that is your representation of

              25  what we talked about, sign it and send it back



                                                               12


               1  to us.

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3          A.   So the short answer is, a

               4  combination of someone typing this up, based

               5  on our conversation, and then me making some

               6  small changes here and there, which I did

               7  make, and then signing it.

               8          Q.   And that -- it certainly must

               9  have upset you, when you were told that

              10  Dr. Holland had accused you of discrimination?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Correct?

              13          A.   Not really.  I was surprised, but

              14  I -- what was the word you used?  Upset me?  I

              15  don't think I was upset by it, no.

              16          Q.   No?

              17          A.   But I was surprised.

              18          Q.   Have you ever -- have you ever

              19  been told, from any other source, that you're

              20  a discriminator?

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              22          A.   Forgive me.  What do I say when

              23  people say objection?

              24             MR. BRAZEAU:  Oh, go ahead and

              25  answer, unless --



                                                               13


               1             THE WITNESS:  I still answer.

               2  Okay.

               3             MR. BRAZEAU:  -- someone instructs

               4  you to --

               5             THE WITNESS:  Okay.

               6             MR. BRAZEAU:  -- not to answer the

               7  question, but go ahead.

               8          A.   Okay, sorry.  Please repeat the

               9  question.  I'm sorry.

              10          Q.   No.  No.  I'm sorry.  Doctor,

              11  just a couple of things.  When an objection

              12  gets made, typically what will happen is if

              13  you're not -- if you're -- unless you're

              14  instructed not to answer, you can normally

              15  answer.

              16          A.   Okay.

              17          Q.   Just so you're aware.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   It's just -- it's just a sequence

              20  of events, and I -- it's -- we, as attorneys,

              21  take it for granted that we know, you know,

              22  that we're so familiar with the process, so it

              23  causes a little anxiety with the witness and

              24  counsel and everything, so just please listen

              25  to the question, then objection, and then



                                                               14


               1  typically you will be able to answer.

               2          A.   Okay.

               3          Q.   And also, if for some reason you

               4  lose the question, sometimes there is a lot of

               5  objections, if for some reason you can't

               6  remember the question, because of an

               7  objection, please just let me know, and

               8  sometimes the court reporter can read it back,

               9  or I'll just reask it, okay?

              10          A.   Sounds good.

              11          Q.   No problem.  Okay.  So, but it

              12  was -- it did surprise you, your word, I'm

              13  fair enough on your word, you were surprised

              14  when you had heard --

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   -- this person that you had been

              17  accused of being a discriminator by

              18  Dr. Holland; is that right?

              19          A.   Sure, yes.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Now, just to be clear,

              21  what do you think it was that -- where --

              22  where do you think it was that Dr. Holland

              23  accused you of being a discriminator?

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              25  speculation.



                                                               15


               1          A.   I actually don't understand the

               2  question.  You mean where in space was he when

               3  he, or what the situation you're asking?  I

               4  don't understand the question.

               5          Q.   All right.  At -- you believed,

               6  given this call, that Dr. Holland had accused

               7  you in some way of discriminating, correct?

               8          A.   Well, let me back that up a

               9  little bit and say that, as I said earlier, I

              10  was told that Dr. Holland was accusing Mercy

              11  Health in -- in general and doctors that work,

              12  or work with, or around doctor -- for Mercy

              13  Health, that in general he was discriminated

              14  against.  Never was -- did anybody say, oh, he

              15  says you discriminated against him, but I --

              16  I'm just in the general sense a cardiologist

              17  who referred patients to CT surgeons.  So the

              18  reason -- how I found out about it was because

              19  somebody told me, but I can't speculate as to

              20  why he would say that.

              21          Q.   Okay.  So as you sit here today,

              22  do you -- do you believe that Dr. Holland has

              23  ever insinuated or suggested that you

              24  personally discriminated and did not refer

              25  cases to him for a discriminatory reason?



                                                               16


               1          A.   So I have -- only -- the only

               2  reason why I would know that is because I did

               3  review the -- his testimony, really just

               4  briefly as it related to me.  And although I

               5  have, again, read over it once or twice tops,

               6  my overview from that takeaway was that when

               7  he's referring to me, that yes, you know, I'm

               8  just like everyone else and have, you know,

               9  discriminated against him and not referred

              10  patients to him.  And I don't know if I was

              11  clear on why I would not have done that, but

              12  he seemed clear in his testimony that he

              13  believed that I had discriminated against him.

              14             But that's the only reason I would

              15  ever suspect or think that he thought that, is

              16  from his own testimony in his affidavit, or

              17  I'm sorry, in his deposition.  Sorry.

              18          Q.   Okay.  But you weren't shown my

              19  client's deposition until after you signed

              20  your affidavit, correct?

              21          A.   That's correct.

              22          Q.   Okay.  So -- so by the time that

              23  my client was deposed, you had signed an

              24  affidavit and attacked him in it, correct?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,



                                                               17


               1  mischaracterization.

               2          A.   No.  I don't think that's correct

               3  at all.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Well, you -- let me go

               5  back.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   Let me take back the word attack.

               8             You -- you listed an egregious

               9  example.  In fact, you listed the most

              10  egregious example of a professional conflict

              11  with Dr. Holland in your affidavit, correct?

              12  That's in paragraph 5A, right?

              13          A.   Whether it's the most egregious,

              14  I -- I don't know that that will be true or

              15  not, but it is a good example of why I, after

              16  that case, really preferred to not have him

              17  take care of my patients.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Well, you signed this

              19  document, your affidavit, under the penalties

              20  of perjury, sir, correct?

              21          A.   Yep.

              22          Q.   Okay.  So let's look at paragraph

              23  5A for a second.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   And the first sentence in



                                                               18


               1  paragraph 5A says, the most egregious example

               2  of my professional conflict with Dr. Holland,

               3  involving a patient with a heart condition who

               4  needed surgery, right?

               5          A.   The most egregious example of my

               6  -- yes, that's what it says, correct.

               7          Q.   Okay.  So is that true, that it

               8  was egregious?

               9          A.   Yes, it was egregious.

              10          Q.   Okay.  So you listed an

              11  egregious, you agree then, that you did list,

              12  according to you, an egregious example dealing

              13  with Dr. Holland, correct?

              14          A.   That's correct.

              15          Q.   And just to be clear, to

              16  acknowledge Mr. Wiencek's statement, I believe

              17  he made this morning, and I don't know if he

              18  did or didn't, but he typically makes it, when

              19  you refer to any patient today, you should not

              20  use any personal indicators, if possible, to

              21  identify the patient.  And we only use

              22  initials of a patient to jog your memory --

              23          A.   Okay.

              24          Q.   -- about the patient, okay?

              25             Just -- that ensures protection on



                                                               19


               1  HIPAA, even though we still have

               2  confidentiality and things on the transcript

               3  that we can do, it still protects, gives us

               4  greater protection, okay?

               5          A.   I understand.

               6          Q.   So I will have to ask you some

               7  questions, but I'm going to try to do it in

               8  the most undescript way as possible.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   This patient that you're

              11  referring to in paragraph 5A, his initials

              12  were RR, is that correct, the patient's

              13  initials?

              14          A.   I believe that's correct, yes.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Just so we -- we're on the

              16  same page when we're talking about that

              17  patient --

              18          A.   Yep.

              19          Q.   -- John and/or Jane Doe, you can

              20  refer to patient male or female or --

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   -- either, okay?

              23             Okay.  So going back in a sequence,

              24  you believed that when you were preparing the

              25  affidavit, that one of the things you were



                                                               20


               1  responding to was an allegation of

               2  discrimination that had been raised by

               3  Dr. Holland generally as to cardiologists,

               4  that also included you?

               5          A.   That's correct.

               6          Q.   So you did have some type of

               7  belief at that time that Dr. Holland had

               8  claimed that the reason that you weren't

               9  referring to him had to do with a

              10  discriminatory reason, correct?

              11          A.   All I could know for sure was

              12  that he was generally referring to

              13  cardiologists and doctors, is all I knew.

              14  Again, my name had not been mentioned, but

              15  generally speaking, yes, I would assume that I

              16  would be included in that, but I can't speak

              17  to what he really thought.

              18          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              19             Now, in terms of your preparation,

              20  I don't want to know about your discussions

              21  with counsel, but what documents did you look

              22  at prior to your deposition?  You mentioned

              23  Dr. Holland's deposition transcript that --

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   -- sections that had to do with



                                                               21


               1  you --

               2          A.   Uh-huh.

               3          Q.   -- correct?

               4          A.   That's some of those, yes,

               5  correct.

               6          Q.   All right.  Anything else that

               7  you looked at, that you can think of?

               8          A.   I believe there was a rebuttal to

               9  my affidavit that Dr. Holland had done, and

              10  then I had responded to, but as far as, you

              11  know, that's -- that's all I can remember.

              12  Those are the only things that I reviewed.

              13          Q.   Now, you said you -- there was

              14  some kind of document or something that you

              15  did to respond to Dr. Holland's rebuttal?

              16          A.   That's correct.

              17          Q.   And what is that that you

              18  prepared?

              19          A.   What it's called, or where it is,

              20  I don't know, but I will just tell you what I

              21  know.  And --

              22          Q.   Okay.

              23          A.   -- that is that I had received a

              24  phone call, I don't know, a month, two months,

              25  three months after the initial affidavit that



                                                               22


               1  I had signed, from someone from Mercy Health

               2  legal counsel, who said, hey, Dr. Holland has

               3  read your affidavit, and he's made some

               4  specific, you know, allegations about what is

               5  not true, and would you mind going through

               6  these, his statements one by one and saying

               7  whether you agree or disagree with them?  So

               8  again, what it's called, where it is, I don't

               9  know, but that's the only other document

              10  prepared or whatever related to this.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And do you know who that

              12  was that -- it was a Mercy lawyer?

              13          A.   It was, but I honestly have no

              14  idea.

              15          Q.   Okay.  We just have -- we don't

              16  have that document, so we're not sure what

              17  that is.  We'll make a request on the record

              18  at this point that it be provided to us.

              19             Okay.  But that -- that was just

              20  sort of you were responding to some things

              21  Dr. Holland had said about, was it from his

              22  deposition, or was it some type of document

              23  that you were reading?

              24          A.   Again, I'll do the best I can

              25  with what I --



                                                               23


               1          Q.   Okay.

               2          A.   -- understood at the time, but my

               3  understanding was that, again, he had read my

               4  depositions, or my, not my deposition, my

               5  affidavit, had -- had his own rebuttals or --

               6  or attitudes about something I had said, and

               7  then they wanted to review with me whether

               8  what he said was true or not.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Jason, I think he's

              10  referring to the amended complaint, where you

              11  had a separate section dealing with Dr. Bruhl.

              12             MR. BRAZEAU:  I would say that too,

              13  Jason.  I believe that's what he's thinking

              14  of.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.  Well, I

              16  don't -- I don't have his responsive document.

              17  It is the day for his deposition, so I'd like

              18  it to be provided to me.

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  I think you have been

              20  given it.  It's called an answer to your

              21  amended complaint.

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Dr. Bruhl didn't

              23  prepare the answer to the complaint.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  You have been

              25  provided an answer, Jason.



                                                               24


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Dr. Bruhl --

               2  Dr. Bruhl, are you being represented by

               3  counsel today?

               4          A.   Yes.

               5          Q.   And who is that?

               6          A.   Jim Brazeau and also Tom, as the

               7  Mercy Health lawyers also.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Okay.  So over the course

               9  -- when did you first meet Dr. Holland?

              10          A.   I can think of the first time I

              11  met him.  I was up at St. Vincent's Hospital.

              12  As far as the -- I would guess 2017 or '16,

              13  but I honestly don't know exactly, but I would

              14  guess around 2017 probably, when I was doing a

              15  heart catheterization up at St. Vincent's

              16  Hospital.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Let me go back a second,

              18  because I -- I -- sometimes I skip over this.

              19  Where have you been -- let me just ask you

              20  some background about yourself, about your

              21  training and things.  I skipped over all of

              22  that --

              23          A.   Sure.

              24          Q.   -- I apologize.  Tell me a little

              25  -- if you can tell me about your educational



                                                               25


               1  training first, and then where -- and then

               2  from there, I'll just ask you your basic work

               3  history, where you have been working.

               4          A.   Okay.  I -- you want starting at

               5  college or medical school or what?

               6          Q.   Yeah.  Yeah.  Just quickly.  You

               7  don't have to go through all your classes.

               8  Just where you graduated from --

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   -- and what years, if you can

              11  remember.

              12          A.   So I went to Cedarville

              13  University in premed.  I did a master's in

              14  molecular biology at Bowling Green.  I did

              15  medical school at UT Medical Center.  I did

              16  residency at UT Medical Center.  I did

              17  fellowship at UT Medical Center.  University

              18  of Toledo Medical Center, I should say.  And

              19  then directly from there, I was employed by

              20  Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital.

              21          Q.   So basically when did you first

              22  start working at Mercy Health --

              23          A.   2011.

              24          Q.   -- Tiffin?

              25             MR. BRAZEAU:  Wait 'til -- wait



                                                               26


               1  until he finishes the question.

               2          A.   Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry.

               3          Q.   When did you first start working

               4  at Mercy Health-Tiffin?

               5          A.   So again, I believe that's 2011,

               6  August of 2011.

               7          Q.   That's when you -- you first were

               8  -- and from that point on, you have been

               9  basically stationed/primarily focused in the

              10  Tiffin area; is that right?

              11          A.   That's correct.  I'll just say

              12  that, probably leading into the next question

              13  is, I do occasional heart catheterizations,

              14  high-risk procedures, at St. Vincent's

              15  Hospital once or twice a month, but that's --

              16  and I, technically, to go one step further,

              17  occasionally go to St. Anne's Hospital too,

              18  but ninety, probably five to eight percent of

              19  my time is at Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital.

              20          Q.   Okay.  In terms of how you tend

              21  to receive patients, do you have a practice

              22  outside the hospital, or at the hospital

              23  itself?  How does that work with you?  Do you

              24  have offices?

              25          A.   It's within the hospital, my --



                                                               27


               1  my office.

               2          Q.   Where do your referrals tend to

               3  come from?  Just come through the hospital

               4  itself or --

               5          A.   So primarily from primary care

               6  doctors in the area.  Almost none of them are

               7  employed by Mercy Health.  And then I do do

               8  consultations on patients inside the hospital,

               9  not a lot, but I don't know, two or three a

              10  day would probably be average for patients

              11  that are admitted to the hospital with

              12  cardiology problems.

              13          Q.   In your Tiffin area, do you have

              14  a competing hospital like ProMedica has down

              15  there or no?

              16          A.   Fostoria is the closest ProMedica

              17  hospital, as far as I know.

              18          Q.   Are your -- do your -- are your

              19  patients typically driven to the hospital, or,

              20  and I say driven, is -- is it typically a

              21  factor in patients being seen at your Mercy

              22  location in Tiffin the type of insurance they

              23  have?  And I can clarify, if you want a little

              24  bit --

              25          A.   Please do, yeah.



                                                               28


               1          Q.   Yeah.  There has been a lot of

               2  testimony from various people, Dr. Kabour and

               3  others have testified in the case, and have

               4  walked through how insurance really sort of

               5  dictates where they can ultimately send a

               6  patient for referral, or how they get a

               7  patient sometimes, depending upon whether

               8  ProMedica controls it.  If ProMedica controls

               9  the insurance, the referrals go to ProMedica

              10  doctors, versus if they don't.  So what I'm

              11  trying to do is get a feel where you are in

              12  Tiffin, if you have the same type of --

              13  because they're -- here in Toledo, where we

              14  are right now, where I am right now, they have

              15  this issue going on about how patients, you

              16  know, where they go.

              17          A.   Yeah.

              18          Q.   Depending upon the insurance.  So

              19  I just want to get a feel from where you are,

              20  that's what you're seeing or --

              21          A.   Yeah.  In general, that has

              22  fairly little to do with where I send

              23  patients, to be honest.  There are situations

              24  where they do have a certain insurance.

              25  That's not very often, but it does happen, in



                                                               29


               1  which case, I would be sure to send them to a

               2  ProMedica hospital, sometimes there is a VA

               3  hospital, that kind of thing.

               4             Most patients over 65, you know,

               5  they go wherever I recommend them to go, based

               6  on what I think is best for their care.

               7          Q.   And typically, on a -- since 2011

               8  to the present, on an annual basis,

               9  approximately how many referrals would you

              10  make to Mercy hospitals for surgical procedure

              11  for a patient?

              12          A.   By a surgical procedure, I'll

              13  just qualify, I assume you're meaning CT

              14  surgery.  That's -- which is pretty much the

              15  only surgery that I, generally speaking, would

              16  refer to.  I wouldn't count a heart cath or a

              17  stent to be a surgery, but --

              18          Q.   I'm just talking about --

              19  correct.

              20          A.   Yeah.

              21          Q.   That's -- that's a fair

              22  definition, so using that definition.

              23          A.   I can only kind of do a wild

              24  guess, because I really don't know, but I

              25  would say somewhere between, in those eight



                                                               30


               1  years, 100 to maybe 3 or 400.  I know it's a

               2  wide range.  If I had to guess at a number,

               3  which, again, I really don't track these

               4  things, maybe 2 or 300.

               5          Q.   Well, how about -- would it be

               6  easier to say on a month -- monthly basis,

               7  like roughly --

               8          A.   Okay.  Sure.

               9          Q.   -- how many on a monthly basis?

              10          A.   Sure.  So that would also vary,

              11  but I would say anywhere from 1 to 2 to maybe

              12  6 or 7, maybe 10 on a really busy month.

              13          Q.   And these are patients from the

              14  Tiffin area that are being referred for

              15  surgery potentially at a Mercy hospital?

              16          A.   They would be patients from the

              17  Tiffin area.  What was the second part of the

              18  question?

              19          Q.   They would be referred to a Mercy

              20  hospital, for the most part, unless it was a

              21  person with a ProMedica insurance, or some

              22  other reason --

              23          A.   No.

              24          Q.   -- that they would go outside --

              25          A.   What I said was I would refer --



                                                               31


               1             THE REPORTER:  Wait, wait a minute,

               2  guys.

               3             THE WITNESS:  Oh, I'm sorry.

               4             THE REPORTER:  I need you to finish

               5  the question.

               6             THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

               7             THE REPORTER:  I didn't get that.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) I said -- let

               9  me strike the question and reask it.

              10             MR. BRAZEAU:  Before you do that,

              11  Jason.  Dr. Bruhl, it's very important --

              12             THE WITNESS:  Yes.

              13             MR. BRAZEAU:  -- not to start your

              14  answer, until he finishes the question.  I

              15  know it's a little awkward, because he's not

              16  physically here, but really try to do so.

              17  We'll try to correct you.  It -- it happens

              18  all the time with witnesses, so don't feel

              19  bad, but it's important that you wait until

              20  the question is done.

              21             THE WITNESS:  I understand.

              22             MR. BRAZEAU:  Even if there is an

              23  unnatural pause, it seems like, let the pause

              24  hang there for a second.

              25             THE WITNESS:  I understand.



                                                               32


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, just

               2  -- just FYI, one of the reasons I actually,

               3  you know, it's to an advantage sometimes not

               4  to be staring at me on a camera, is it helps

               5  to listen, but we get a little conversational

               6  sometimes.  And it's just -- it's not

               7  intended.  I can tell that you weren't trying

               8  to talk over me.  It just happens sometimes.

               9  I'll reask the question.

              10             Do -- so typically, do your

              11  referrals go to a Mercy hospital, absent what

              12  you described earlier, a situation like their

              13  insurance, or another factor, you know,

              14  causing them to have to be referred outside

              15  the system?

              16          A.   So I would say that I send

              17  patients to the place that I think they would

              18  be best cared for them, to the doctors I think

              19  that would best take care of them, regardless

              20  whether they're Mercy or not.  It does help

              21  that I know firsthand doctors at Mercy Health,

              22  and so that oftentimes is the case.  But I

              23  guess to straightforward answer your question,

              24  I send patients wherever they're going to get

              25  their best care, in my opinion, where they get



                                                               33


               1  their best care.

               2          Q.   Okay.  But typically, where has

               3  that been?  In terms -- have you -- have you

               4  -- in terms of your patients, you have

               5  indicated that maybe 100, over 2011 to 2000,

               6  to the present, maybe anywhere from 100 to 3

               7  or 400 surgical patients referred.  And where

               8  have those -- where has the highest percentage

               9  of those been referred to?

              10          A.   The majority is that it's been to

              11  St. Vincent's Hospital.

              12          Q.   Now, did you have -- and when you

              13  referred cases in 2011 to St. Vincent

              14  Hospital, what doctors, if any, did you refer

              15  cases to?

              16          A.   Again, I'm not trying to be coy

              17  here, but to better accurate, more accurately

              18  answer your questions, do you happen to know

              19  the doctors that were there?  I can think of

              20  one or two, but the doctors that were CT

              21  surgeons up at St. Vincent's Hospital?

              22          Q.   All right.  Let me give you some

              23  names.  Sure.  I'll give you names --

              24          A.   Yeah.

              25          Q.   -- of people.  I can't tell you



                                                               34


               1  precisely exactly when people --

               2          A.   Yeah.

               3          Q.   -- just offhand.  I won't give

               4  you per se dates of each departure, or what

               5  have you.

               6          A.   Yeah.

               7          Q.   I'll give you the following names

               8  to make this a little easier over various

               9  times.  There is Dr. Brunsting.

              10          A.   Uh-huh.

              11          Q.   There is Dr. Bur --

              12          A.   I did refer patients to

              13  Dr. Brunsting, yes.

              14          Q.   There is Dr. Burdine.

              15          A.   Yes, I did refer patients to

              16  Dr. Burdine.

              17          Q.   There is Dr. Hashmi.

              18          A.   Yes, I referred patients to

              19  Dr. Hashmi.

              20          Q.   Eventually, there is Dr. Holland.

              21          A.   Yes, I referred patients to

              22  Dr. Holland.

              23          Q.   Dr. Phillips.

              24          A.   Yes, I referred patients to

              25  Dr. Phillips.



                                                               35


               1          Q.   And then I -- I think in the more

               2  recent times, there is -- there was Koteck --

               3  Kokocki?

               4          A.   I wouldn't say necessarily

               5  referred patients, but he did do patients, did

               6  surgery, surgical patients of mine.

               7          Q.   Okay.  And then there was a

               8  Dr. DiBardino?

               9          A.   Correct.  I have referred

              10  patients to Dr. DiBardino.

              11          Q.   And I believe that Dr. Phillips

              12  and Dr. DiBardino are still currently at

              13  Mercy-St. Vincent; is that right?

              14          A.   That is my understanding too.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Now, when -- when

              16  Dr. Brunsting, Burdine and Hashmi were there

              17  simultaneously, there was a period of time

              18  where they were --

              19          A.   Uh-huh.

              20          Q.   -- those doctors, I believe they

              21  were simultaneously there.  There may not have

              22  been that much overlap between Burdine and

              23  Brunsting, but I think there was.

              24          A.   Uh-huh.

              25          Q.   During that period, when those



                                                               36


               1  three gentlemen, who would you typically refer

               2  the cases to?

               3          A.   Burdine, Brunsting and --

               4          Q.   Hashmi.

               5          A.   -- Hashmi?

               6             You're talking about in 2011?

               7          Q.   Well, just in terms of the time

               8  periods when those gentlemen, you could

               9  remember those gentlemen all being -- sort of

              10  there at the same time, or around the same

              11  time.  And I'm saying this, because at some

              12  point, Dr. Brunsting drops off, and it's just

              13  Burdine and Hashmi, until Holland comes in

              14  2013.

              15          A.   Let me try and answer this in the

              16  best attitude of the question, at least

              17  assuming you want, obviously you want to know

              18  the, my thought process, and perhaps that will

              19  help.

              20          Q.   No.  Okay.  Let me -- let me go

              21  back a second.  Let me -- let me -- let me

              22  give you a time period, so that this will make

              23  it easier for you, okay?

              24             You arrive when roughly in 2011?

              25          A.   August.



                                                               37


               1          Q.   August.  Okay.  So we're going to

               2  talk about the time period right now first,

               3  August of 2011 through April of 2013.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   And during that time period,

               6  Dr. Holland arrives in April of 2013.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   Okay.  So prior to April of 2013,

               9  there is only three potential surgeons,

              10  Brunsting, Burdine and Hashmi.  But Brunsting

              11  drops off, I think, in -- at the end of 2 --

              12  December of 2012 roughly, Brunsting is gone,

              13  we believe.  So during the period that you

              14  first arrived, August of 2011, until

              15  Dr. Holland arrives in April of 2013, of those

              16  three surgeons, Brunsting, Burdine and Hashmi,

              17  who did you typically refer to?

              18          A.   It was a case-by-case basis, but

              19  again, to try and get you into my thinking on

              20  that one, is -- I'll just say up front, when I

              21  didn't know any of them, I basically referred

              22  to whoever was on call, so to speak, or who

              23  was in the office, or whatever, as I didn't

              24  really know who was good or -- or bad or

              25  whatever.



                                                               38


               1             And as I became more knowledgeable

               2  about each individual physician, and their

               3  outcomes, I then tailored my referrals based

               4  on whether I thought that doctor could or

               5  could not handle, you know, the case in front

               6  of me.

               7             And so to summarize that all, and

               8  that, really from that point on began with

               9  when cases were fairly difficult, complicated,

              10  or I needed a certain special technique, like

              11  minimally invasive, I would send to that

              12  doctor who can handle that, even if they were

              13  not on call.

              14             When they were straight, simple,

              15  straightforward, two or three vessel bypasses,

              16  that I thought any surgeon could do, I would

              17  typically call for whoever is on call, feeling

              18  confident they could handle it.

              19             Does that help?

              20          Q.   All right.  So, typically then

              21  you would indicate that you would just refer

              22  -- basically the -- the surgical office would

              23  take care of it, unless it was one that you

              24  specifically referred, because you believed it

              25  was more complicated and needed to -- special



                                                               39


               1  attention?

               2          A.   Yeah.  That -- I'm sorry, that's

               3  correct.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And -- and so your typical

               5  procedure, not -- and I'm not talking about

               6  your atypical special case, I'm talking about

               7  your typical.  Your typical procedure was to

               8  defer to the surgical office itself, in terms

               9  of the assignment of the surgeon?

              10          A.   I don't know that I would qualify

              11  it as typical.  As I briefly said before, I

              12  would try to refer the patient to the doctor

              13  that I thought best to handle the situation.

              14             When any of the doctors could, I

              15  would refer to the -- the office, or the CT

              16  surgery office, to divvy up as they saw fit,

              17  assuming I thought all the doctors could

              18  handle it.

              19             Whether that was most of the cases,

              20  that's probably not the truth, that most cases

              21  were like that, but again, the simpler cases,

              22  I really was confident with any of the doctors

              23  handling the -- the patients.  Otherwise, I

              24  would specifically refer to the doctor I

              25  thought most appropriate.



                                                               40


               1          Q.   Okay.  So before Dr. Holland

               2  arrived, who did you typically refer the

               3  complicated cases to?

               4          A.   I will just say that my

               5  recollection of Dr. Holland, not Dr. Holland,

               6  sorry, Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Brunsting, I was

               7  fairly impressed early on with their outcomes.

               8  Not that I didn't think bad against

               9  Dr. Brunsting, but I do remember feeling more

              10  confident in their care over time, and so

              11  between the two of them, I felt, maybe

              12  equally, I felt confident in both those two

              13  surgeons.

              14          Q.   Over Dr. Burdine?

              15          A.   That's correct.  Which doesn't

              16  mean I didn't think he was good.  I just mean

              17  my experience was that the other two were,

              18  seemed stronger, in my experience, with their

              19  cases.

              20          Q.   So you believed that you referred

              21  an equal number of cases to Dr. Brunsting and

              22  Dr. Hashmi in terms of complicated cases?  Or

              23  is it the case that you referred almost all of

              24  the cases to Dr. Hashmi and only a few to

              25  Dr. Brunsting?



                                                               41


               1          A.   If you have numbers to show me, I

               2  could, I suppose, try and say what I think is

               3  right or wrong.  The best I can say is on a

               4  case-by-case basis, I tried to do what was

               5  best for the patients in front of me.

               6             As I said before, I felt confident

               7  both in Dr. Brunsting and Dr. Holland --

               8  Hashmi.  What percentage, what number, I

               9  really can't tell you.  I don't remember.

              10          Q.   Well, we don't -- we have not

              11  been given the numbers yet from the hospital,

              12  Doctor.  We have asked for them, and so

              13  obviously I'll -- I'll caveat -- I'll caveat

              14  that, what I'm about to tell you.  But we do

              15  have a document, that Dr. Holland was -- was

              16  provided, and it shows that, at least for the

              17  numbers we have here, that you sent 13 cases

              18  to Dr. Hashmi, 4 cases to Dr. Burdine, and --

              19  and only 2 cases to Dr. Brunsting.

              20          A.   Okay.

              21          Q.   Would that sound consistent with

              22  your memory, or does that sound that those

              23  numbers appear to be off to you?

              24          A.   I --

              25          Q.   And this is --



                                                               42


               1          A.   -- I could live with that.

               2  Honestly, I don't know for sure, and I have no

               3  -- I was never keeping track, but I guess if

               4  indeed that is the truth, I probably would not

               5  argue against it.

               6          Q.   Okay.  And I -- and I just want

               7  to -- you mentioned the -- one of the things

               8  that you -- and you're -- you're in -- you

               9  practice on a daily basis in Tiffin, correct?

              10          A.   That's correct.  Monday through

              11  Friday, and on the phone on the weekends.

              12          Q.   Okay.  Well, other -- other than

              13  going to --

              14          A.   Yeah, and St. Vincent's,

              15  occasionally.

              16          Q.   -- I know -- I know -- you know,

              17  for the most part day-to-day you're there.

              18  And so you indicated earlier that over time,

              19  you learned more about outcomes and -- of the

              20  surgeons.  And I'm wondering what your source

              21  of information was on that.

              22          A.   So I would say when the patients

              23  came back to me, their recovery would be a big

              24  part of it, their attitude about the doctor

              25  and their care that they received.  That was,



                                                               43


               1  I'll be honest, quite important to me, that

               2  they felt their care was good too.  It's not

               3  just about the surgery itself.  And then I

               4  think the completeness of the procedure.  I

               5  realize every case has challenges, and they

               6  don't always go the way we think, but if -- I

               7  would always call every doctor, I would say

               8  almost without question, and talk to the

               9  surgeon and say, hey, this is what I'm

              10  thinking, take a look at the pictures, what do

              11  you think.  We would try to agree ahead of

              12  time on what we thought was the best course

              13  for the patient.

              14             When the patients came back, and

              15  that was done, I counted that as I can trust

              16  this guy and this surgeon.  When they came

              17  back, and that wasn't done, that would go

              18  against my feeling of -- of quality with that

              19  -- that doctor.

              20             So, I guess, lots of things went

              21  into what makes up my attitude about a

              22  different surgeon, but -- but those are the

              23  major ones.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Well, I was just

              25  wondering, so you, from your own personal



                                                               44


               1  experience upon patients returning to you, you

               2  were able to identify or evaluate outcomes,

               3  correct?

               4          A.   Sure, that's correct.

               5          Q.   And so that would mean that in

               6  order to evaluate a surgeon's outcomes, you

               7  would have to be referring them cases to begin

               8  with, correct?

               9          A.   Well, there are other ways to --

              10  so, partly, that would be one way.  Another

              11  way would be when I refer patients, and the

              12  surgeon turns down the cases, or says they

              13  can't do it, or they don't think they can do

              14  it, or -- so that would be another example of

              15  how I can learn about a surgeon's quality

              16  experiences from their own lips, when I call

              17  them on cases.

              18          Q.   That doesn't tell you the

              19  outcomes, because that's just a surgeon saying

              20  they're not going to do the case.

              21          A.   So -- okay.  So I thought we were

              22  talking about how I evaluated --

              23          Q.   No.  We're talking about

              24  outcomes.

              25          A.   -- the quality of the surgeon.



                                                               45


               1  So yes, back to your point, yes, they would

               2  have to do a case for me to know the outcome

               3  of the surgery.

               4          Q.   Yeah.  Okay.  So -- and then I'm

               5  trying to -- I'm just trying -- you're in

               6  Tiffin, so I'm just trying to understand the

               7  information flow a little bit.  You know, I'm

               8  not asking you to speculate or guess, and

               9  there may be things you don't know.

              10          A.   Sure.

              11          Q.   And that's fair -- it's a fair

              12  answer.  I'm just trying to get your best

              13  information today, and you're -- and you're

              14  doing fine so far.

              15             So for example, no one would like

              16  mail you S, you know, Society of Thoracic

              17  Surgeon Data to the Tiffin hospital for you to

              18  review for each of the surgeons, correct?

              19          A.   That's correct that I never

              20  received any data like that.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And you have heard -- have

              22  you heard that such data exists?

              23          A.   I assume, and again, I only

              24  briefly know about this, but I think STS

              25  database is perhaps what you're speaking of --



                                                               46


               1          Q.   Yeah.

               2          A.   -- I have heard of it.  I have

               3  actually never seen it.  It's -- I -- so I've

               4  heard of it, but I've never seen it.  I'm

               5  really not familiar with the data in it.

               6          Q.   Are you -- are you generally

               7  familiar that there is an STS database?

               8          A.   That there is a database with

               9  that name, correct, yes.

              10          Q.   Just to be clear, when you came

              11  in -- when you came in to Mercy system, you

              12  received all of your training through Mercy

              13  basically?

              14          A.   No, none of my training through

              15  Mercy.  Well, that's actually not true.  I'm

              16  sorry.  So almost 95 percent of my training is

              17  through UT Medical Center.  In full

              18  disclosure, I actually did do six months of

              19  training at St. Vincent's Hospital during my

              20  internal medicine years, but Mercy Health did

              21  not give me my training.  UT -- University of

              22  Toledo Medical Center did.

              23          Q.   Do you know what is contained in

              24  the STS database, generally?  And I don't mean

              25  specifics of the exact data, but do you have a



                                                               47


               1  general idea what is contained in there?

               2          A.   So I believe that, and again, I

               3  actually don't even know who sets this up, but

               4  my understanding of that database is it's a

               5  database that surgeons use to keep track of

               6  their own infection rates, or complication

               7  rates, or death rates, or those kinds of

               8  things.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And in terms of working at

              10  Mercy, no one at Mercy-Tiffin Hospital has

              11  ever indicated to you that it's a best

              12  practice, or a good practice, for referring

              13  cardiologists have access to that information,

              14  so they can see the exact statistics of how

              15  things are turning out?

              16          A.   Neither at UT Medical Center, or

              17  at Mercy Health, has anybody ever suggested

              18  that.

              19          Q.   Okay.  And so -- fair enough.

              20             When you were training, how many

              21  surgeries did you participate in?

              22          A.   You talking about cardiothoracic

              23  surgeries?

              24          Q.   Yes.

              25          A.   I'll estimate the best I can, but



                                                               48


               1  I would probably say maybe 30 or 40 cases

               2  directly in the operating room, if that's what

               3  you're asking.  I mean, obviously hundreds of

               4  cases that I took care of patients that were

               5  admitted to the hospital, who then went to the

               6  surgery, and I would be consulted on, and see

               7  in the hospital.  But if you're asking in the

               8  operating room, probably 30 to 40, but

               9  hundreds over the course of their care over my

              10  training.  Maybe -- maybe even a thousand.

              11          Q.   Now, in terms of Mercy, did you

              12  ever sit in or participate in a surgery with

              13  Dr. Brunsting?

              14          A.   No.

              15          Q.   Did you ever sit in or

              16  participate in a surgery with Dr. Burdine?

              17          A.   I have not participated in any

              18  surgeon's actual operating room.

              19          Q.   Okay.

              20          A.   At Mercy Health.

              21          Q.   All right.  And so you did not

              22  participate in any surgeries with Dr. Hashmi,

              23  correct?

              24          A.   Not in the operating room, no.

              25          Q.   And you never observed, just to



                                                               49


               1  confirm, you never observed any of the

               2  surgeons performing surgeries at Mercy

               3  hospitals actually performing them in person,

               4  correct?

               5          A.   That's correct.

               6          Q.   Now -- all right.  So prior to

               7  April of 2013, when Dr. Holland arrived, we

               8  were talking about your understanding of

               9  outcomes.  Although, I -- let me go back a

              10  second.  We were just talking about outcomes

              11  before maybe generally.  But other than seeing

              12  patients that come back, did you have any --

              13  strike that.

              14             Other than what you've already

              15  mentioned, did you have any other sources of

              16  information pertaining to the outcomes that

              17  you were relying upon when you were referring

              18  patients?

              19          A.   Again, I'm not -- for total

              20  completeness sake, I suppose one more would be

              21  talking to the primary care doctors and their

              22  -- the -- my -- the doctors that referred to

              23  me, their attitudes or feelings about the

              24  outcomes and the care, but I can't really

              25  think of any other sources of things that I



                                                               50


               1  would take into account, as far as outcomes

               2  and quality.

               3          Q.   Okay.  So for the period prior to

               4  Dr. Holland's arrival in April of 2013, what

               5  -- what doctors, if any, would provide you

               6  with their opinions about outcomes, that would

               7  then influence who you referred patients to?

               8          A.   I can't think of specific names,

               9  but again, to try and answer the attitude of

              10  your question, when patients would come back

              11  from surgery, and they would follow up with

              12  their primary care doctor, and the primary

              13  care doctor would say, how did your surgery

              14  go, what did you think of the surgeon, you

              15  know, how was your care?  Frequently, some of

              16  those doctors would get back to me, especially

              17  when there was things that were poor, and

              18  sometimes things that were good, and so those

              19  doctors would give me feedback.

              20             Specific doctors that said it, I,

              21  again, if you want me to list all the doctors

              22  at Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital, that will be

              23  a list, but specific names or times, I -- I

              24  can't tell you.

              25          Q.   Well, was there ever any reason



                                                               51


               1  that you didn't want to refer cases to

               2  Dr. Burdine that you can think of?

               3          A.   No.  He was technically a --

               4  forgive me.  I want to just think about the

               5  term.  His -- his technical title was a --

               6  forgive me, I'll do the best I can here -- a

               7  thoracic surgeon that focused on thoracic

               8  surgery in general, not on cardiothoracic

               9  surgery.  In other words, bypass surgery.  He

              10  could do them, he did do them.  As far as I

              11  know, he had good outcomes, but he focused on

              12  taking out tumors in the lung, or those kind

              13  of things.  So -- I'm sorry, what was the

              14  question again?

              15          Q.   Where -- where did you learn that

              16  information about that's what Dr. Burdine

              17  specialized in?

              18          A.   From Dr. Burdine.

              19          Q.   Dr. Burdine told you that?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Did he ever talk to you about the

              22  Muslims?

              23          A.   Never.

              24          Q.   Did he ever complain to you about

              25  the fact that he wasn't getting referrals?



                                                               52


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Did he ever tell you that he

               3  circulated a memo about referrals?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Because he was upset about them?

               6          A.   I -- I've never heard that.

               7          Q.   No?  Okay.

               8             Well, now Dr. Brunsting, any reason

               9  you can think of that you didn't refer -- you

              10  wouldn't refer cases to Dr. Brunsting?

              11          A.   The -- and I -- I don't know this

              12  for sure, but again, I'll do the best I can

              13  with what I -- I remember, is that although I

              14  think from a surgical standpoint of basic,

              15  cardiothoracic surgery, I felt equally

              16  confident in general about those two.  If it

              17  was a minimally invasive case, I knew that

              18  Dr. Hashmi could do that.  In other words, not

              19  crack the chest.  And so that would be a

              20  reason why I would specifically refer to him.

              21             I do not believe, and you feel free

              22  to correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not

              23  believe that Dr. Brunsting did that.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Well, I will correct you,

              25  because you are wrong actually.



                                                               53


               1          A.   Okay.

               2          Q.   Yeah.  Dr. Brunsting came in, and

               3  although there is conflicting -- there is some

               4  varying testimony on this point as to the

               5  degree, but Dr. Brunsting knew how to do

               6  minimally invasive surgery before he came, and

               7  assisted or participated with Dr. Hashmi in

               8  performing surgeries, minimally invasive

               9  surgeries.

              10             There is also some evidence,

              11  although I will, again, represent to you it's

              12  conflicting from the witnesses, that

              13  Dr. Brunsting participated in training

              14  Dr. Hashmi into how to do that.  And

              15  Dr. Brunsting also did robotic surgery.

              16             So I -- I, you know, with those

              17  representations in mind, were you not aware

              18  that Dr. Brunsting did minimally invasive

              19  procedures, until I mentioned that to you

              20  today?

              21          A.   I do not remember him mentioning

              22  that to me.

              23          Q.   Okay.  All right.  So other than

              24  the -- other than what you just mentioned, any

              25  other -- anything else you can think of why



                                                               54


               1  you wouldn't have referred to Dr. Brunsting?

               2          A.   Nothing comes to mind, no.

               3          Q.   Do you know a doctor named Ed

               4  Nahhas?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   Were you ever made aware that

               7  Dr. Nahhas appears on an audio recording in

               8  this case?

               9          A.   I was not aware.

              10          Q.   And that -- and this isn't a

              11  direct quote, but Dr. Nahhas says words to the

              12  effect that Dr. Brunsting told him that he was

              13  unable to get referrals, because Hashmi was

              14  very controlling, like he had a mafia behind

              15  the scenes.

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              17  misrepresentation.

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  It's not, and --

              19  and I'm going to mark the record.

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Yeah, mark it.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor --

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Thank you.  And I'm

              23  going to -- we'll address it later.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, now,

              25  have you ever heard words used -- or strike



                                                               55


               1  that.

               2             Did you ever hear, from any source,

               3  that Dr. Hashmi was controlling in the way the

               4  referrals were?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   And did you have any insight into

               7  how the office was being run at

               8  Mercy-St. Vincent that the cardiologists, or

               9  the cardiothoracic surgeons all operated from?

              10  Did you ever have any insight as to how that

              11  office operated?

              12          A.   Specifics, no.  And I'll just, to

              13  be complete, the best of my ability is, kind

              14  of as I mentioned earlier, is that when I

              15  called and said I wanted a specific surgeon to

              16  be consulted, I expected that would be done,

              17  and that was done.  When I said, hey, whoever

              18  is on, you know, I was fine to take care of

              19  this -- this case, that that happened as well.

              20  That's all I know, as far as how the office

              21  was run.

              22          Q.   Well, how -- how frequent -- in

              23  terms of whether or not a patient was -- a

              24  surgeon was selected by you, versus you

              25  deferred to the office to do so, with what



                                                               56


               1  frequency did those occur?  What percentages?

               2          A.   Not --

               3          Q.   Best estimate.

               4          A.   -- not trying to be evasive, I

               5  never tracked that to any kind.  It really was

               6  a case-by-case basis.

               7             I'll actually add one more.  Again,

               8  forgive me.  Perhaps I should have mentioned

               9  this earlier, but since I do heart

              10  catheterizations, and at that time we find out

              11  they need bypass surgery, when the disease is

              12  severe, usually what I would do is I would, if

              13  it was my partner who was the primary

              14  caretaker of this patient, and I was just

              15  doing the heart cath, I would call the, my

              16  partner and say, hey, this is the stuff, and,

              17  hey, let's take a look at the pictures

              18  together, and if we agree the patient needed

              19  bypass surgery, or be referred for bypass

              20  surgery, I would say, who do you want me to

              21  refer 'em to, and so I would do that.

              22             If it was a primary care doctor,

              23  who I knew cared, and some did, I would call

              24  them and say, hey, who do you want?  Do you

              25  have a preference?  And occasionally they



                                                               57


               1  would say things, and I would say, well, this

               2  is the reason I might do this or that, but

               3  then we agreed, and then I would make that

               4  referral.

               5             So again, based on the outcomes of

               6  those discussions, some would go to the pool,

               7  and some would go to specific doctors.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Well, do you recall it

               9  being more frequent that it would go to the

              10  pool, or that you would pick out specific

              11  doctors?

              12          A.   To be honest, probably more

              13  frequent that I would go to specific doctors.

              14  I'll just say that I have a fairly

              15  straightforward attitude about this.  And that

              16  is, I would never refer a patient to a doctor

              17  that I wouldn't have my own father get surgery

              18  on.

              19             And so on a case-by-case basis, if

              20  I thought, hey, I wouldn't mind if this doctor

              21  did surgery on my surgery, or on my father,

              22  that would be fine.  If I felt nervous about

              23  the outcome, because of the patient's age, or

              24  comorbidities, or I needed minimally invasive,

              25  or whatever, then I would, in those



                                                               58


               1  situations, say, jee, if it was my dad, I'd

               2  probably call this guy, in which case -- so

               3  that did probably lead to more patients being

               4  referred to the direct doctor, than as opposed

               5  to the pool, so to speak.

               6          Q.   And during the years that you

               7  were referring patients to Dr. Fayyaz Hashmi,

               8  what did you do to educate yourself, if

               9  anything, about his death statistics?

              10          A.   Well, on my own cases, I only

              11  remember one case of any patient ever dying.

              12  I -- I'm not saying that that couldn't have

              13  been otherwise, but from my experience with

              14  him, which was probably at least 100 or more

              15  cases, he had very low death certificates,

              16  based on, you know, my experience with the

              17  patients I sent him.

              18          Q.   And you believe that -- and you

              19  believe that those cases that you sent him,

              20  those hundred or so cases, were sent over the

              21  time period, let's say 2011 until whenever

              22  Dr. Hashmi left, correct?

              23          A.   That's correct.

              24          Q.   And according to what you saw,

              25  for your patients at least, you didn't even



                                                               59


               1  see any complication rates that seemed to be

               2  high, correct?

               3          A.   That is correct.

               4          Q.   So if these deaths and

               5  complications were happening in Hashmi

               6  patients, they must have been in -- if they

               7  were, they were happening in some other

               8  doctors' referrals, because they certainly

               9  weren't happening in yours, right?

              10          A.   As I said, I did not see any

              11  significant, unexpected number of

              12  complications with Dr. Hashmi with the

              13  patients I referred to him.

              14          Q.   Now, in the year 2000 -- we've

              15  mentioned Brunsting and Burdine, and we've

              16  talked about case numbers and referrals.  So

              17  I'll talk about April 2013, until the time

              18  that Dr. Holland left.

              19             And in the years that Dr. Holland,

              20  Dr. Hashmi and Dr. Phillips were there, and

              21  there is -- there is overlap.  Not in every

              22  year.

              23          A.   Say it again, Holland,

              24  Phillips --

              25          Q.   Holland, Hashmi, and Phillips.



                                                               60


               1          A.   Okay.

               2          Q.   Phillips comes in -- hang on one

               3  second.

               4             Dr. Phillips comes in basically May

               5  of 2015.  So we're now talking Dr. Holland

               6  arrives in April of 2013.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   Dr. Phillips arrives in

               9  approximately May of 2015.

              10          A.   Okay.

              11          Q.   And then Dr. Holland was the

              12  first to depart, Dr. Hashmi retired, after

              13  Dr. Holland left, I believe.  Dr. Holland left

              14  in or about March 2018.

              15             So we're looking at the period of

              16  April 2013 through roughly March of 2018, that

              17  five-year period.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   And we know from what you have

              20  testified that for about 2011, until the end

              21  of Dr. Hashmi's tenure, which I believe was in

              22  2018 as well, when he left, you had

              23  approximately 100 cases referred to

              24  Dr. Hashmi, correct?

              25          A.   I would say at least 100 cases,



                                                               61


               1  would be my estimate.  I don't know a number,

               2  but roughly, that's probably fair.

               3          Q.   Okay.  And in the years 2000, May

               4  of 2015, until March of 2018, roughly, that

               5  three-year period, how many cases did you

               6  refer to Dr. Phillips?

               7          A.   I don't know.

               8          Q.   None?

               9          A.   No.  I'm sure he's had cases, but

              10  I don't know how many.

              11          Q.   Very few, right?

              12          A.   That's a relative term, but less

              13  than Dr. Hashmi, if that's what you're asking.

              14          Q.   Well, how many did you refer,

              15  less than 10 to Dr. Phillips?

              16          A.   I really don't know, but if you

              17  told me 30, I wouldn't be surprised.  If you

              18  told me 10, I could believe that as well.  So

              19  if you have the numbers, feel free to just

              20  tell me.

              21          Q.   We've asked Mercy for the numb --

              22  the exact numbers.  I don't have the exact

              23  numbers.

              24          A.   Okay.  I don't either.

              25          Q.   And you referred no cases to



                                                               62


               1  Dr. Holland; is that correct?

               2          A.   I'm sorry, when was that that I

               3  --

               4          Q.   Well, Dr. Holland.  I'm talking

               5  about Holland now.  You're talking -- I talked

               6  about Phillips.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   Now I want to talk about

               9  Dr. Holland.  He came in April of 2013, and he

              10  left in 2018.

              11             And during that time period, you

              12  referred him no cases, correct, zero?

              13          A.   No, I don't believe that's true

              14  at all.  I mean, that's not true.

              15          Q.   Oh, you did, you referred him

              16  cases?

              17          A.   That's correct.

              18          Q.   The lay-up ones, the easy ones

              19  that you thought he could do?

              20          A.   That would be your words, not

              21  mine, but --

              22          Q.   No, I don't know.  I'm --

              23          A.   -- I'll go back to my words.  If

              24  my own father, I felt that my own father I

              25  would refer to him, and that he would have a



                                                               63


               1  good outcome, then I would refer to

               2  Dr. Holland and not feel bad about it.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Did you have any --

               4  overall, did you have any quality issues with

               5  Dr. Holland?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7          Q.   So -- but you still referred him

               8  cases?

               9          A.   Well, it takes times to figure

              10  out quality.  And so I did find out quality,

              11  but yes, I referred him cases in the

              12  beginning.

              13          Q.   Well, in the year 2000 and, let's

              14  say 17, how many cases did you refer

              15  Dr. Holland?

              16          A.   I don't know the answer to that.

              17          Q.   Well, was there a period when you

              18  -- was there ever a time when you stopped

              19  referring Dr. Holland any cases at all from

              20  that point forward?

              21          A.   So in my affidavit, I think that

              22  was the final time I was going to refer

              23  patients to Dr. Holland.

              24          Q.   How did you determine quality, if

              25  you didn't actually look at data?



                                                               64


               1          A.   So I'd like to take a break after

               2  this, but please repeat the question.  I'd be

               3  happy to answer.

               4          Q.   Yes.  And we'll take a break

               5  after this.  How did you determine quality, if

               6  you didn't look at data?

               7          A.   So data is outcomes of my

               8  patients, so -- and I told you that -- you're

               9  saying, again -- again, I just want to make

              10  sure I answer your question correctly.  You're

              11  saying how did I determine quality, if I

              12  didn't refer patients, is that what you said?

              13          Q.   If you don't look at data, how

              14  did you determine quality?

              15          A.   So as I mentioned before, quality

              16  has many forms.  Probably the most important

              17  one is the ones that come back to me, how they

              18  recover, how -- whether what I have asked to

              19  be done is done, whether the patients felt

              20  they got good care, so that is data.  And so

              21  that's data I'm analyzing and -- and taking

              22  over time and forming an opinion about a

              23  doctor.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Well, you would like a

              25  break, and I think we're over about an hour,



                                                               65


               1  over an hour at this point, so let's take a

               2  break, about 10 minutes or so, take restroom

               3  and whatnot, so that we can -- thank you,

               4  Doctor.

               5          A.   Thank you.

               6             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record.

               7             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

               8  10:40 until 10:51.)

               9             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on

              10  record.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Took a short

              12  break, Doctor.  You're always welcome to take

              13  a break, provided there is no question

              14  pending.  We had been going for a while, so

              15  ... okay.  I was coming back to referrals with

              16  Dr. Holland.

              17             So am I correct that between

              18  November of 2013, and the RR case, from

              19  November of 2013, until the time that RR

              20  presented to the hospital, that you had no

              21  communications whatsoever with Dr. Holland?

              22          A.   That is incorrect.  I did have

              23  communications with Dr. Holland during that

              24  time.

              25          Q.   Okay.  What type of



                                                               66


               1  communications did you have with Dr. Holland

               2  during that time, between November of 2013,

               3  and the time when RR presented to the hospital

               4  in May 2017, what type of communications did

               5  you have with Dr. Holland during that time

               6  period?

               7          A.   So I'll do the best I can on

               8  this, but he may or may not have come down and

               9  met me in the Tiffin office.  I -- I know

              10  Dr. Burdine did, I know Dr. Hashmi did, and I

              11  probably assume that he did too, so I expected

              12  I probably met him at that time.  I certainly

              13  didn't have any ill feelings.  He seemed like

              14  a nice enough guy.

              15             The first time I really remember

              16  for sure meeting him, though, that I can

              17  clearly remember, was when I was doing a case

              18  up at St. Vincent's Hospital, what I felt was

              19  a pretty straightforward 55,

              20  50-something-year-old man, who needed a couple

              21  bypasses and a valve surgery done.  And so I

              22  asked the cath lab staff who is around, and

              23  they said Dr. Holland, and so I said, well,

              24  sure, let's consult him.

              25             And we spoke about the case, we



                                                               67


               1  reviewed the films, and he said, great, sounds

               2  like a great patient, let's get him set up.

               3  I'll talk to him, and you know, I'll let you

               4  know when things are done.  That was the first

               5  time I -- I can remember meeting him.

               6          Q.   Do you remember when that -- what

               7  year that was?

               8          A.   I really don't.  I personally

               9  think it was probably within the first few

              10  months of him, you know, joining Mercy Health,

              11  but I -- I really could not tell you that for

              12  sure.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And -- well, the first few

              14  months, he was in -- Dr. Holland came in April

              15  of 2013.

              16          A.   Uh-huh.

              17          Q.   Okay.  So you met him in the

              18  first couple of months?

              19          A.   I believe so.

              20          Q.   Okay.  And then other than

              21  meeting him in the first couple of months in

              22  person, how many other times did you ever see

              23  Dr. Holland, that you can remember?

              24          A.   In person, probably just a half

              25  dozen times.  Certainly not more than a dozen



                                                               68


               1  times, over that entire time.

               2          Q.   You mean like encountering him in

               3  the hospital, or he would come --

               4          A.   Yeah.

               5          Q.   -- down to your area or --

               6          A.   No.  I'm not sure I ever saw him

               7  again down in Tiffin area.  But when I would

               8  be up at St. Vincent's Hospital doing cases

               9  there, I would, again, occasionally refer

              10  patients to him, depending on the -- the

              11  situation.

              12             I may have seen him at some

              13  conferences-type stuff, and you know, briefly

              14  talked to him there, so that was my firsthand

              15  in-person experience with Dr. Holland.

              16          Q.   And in person, when you would

              17  have experience with him, were those,

              18  generally speaking, professional interactions?

              19  And I'll leave out RR case for --

              20          A.   Right.

              21          Q.   -- we'll leave out the RR case

              22  for right now, because that's obviously

              23  something we may or may not talk about in

              24  greater detail.

              25          A.   Okay.



                                                               69


               1          Q.   Other than RR case, the times

               2  when you would see him in a personal basis,

               3  what was your typical interaction?

               4          A.   As far as his attitude and

               5  friendliness in general, he seemed fine.

               6          Q.   All right.  Now, you did refer

               7  him a case in 2013; is that correct?

               8          A.   I -- again, as -- if you're

               9  talking about what I told you about the first

              10  time I met him, and if indeed that was the

              11  first few months of him being there, then --

              12  then yes.

              13          Q.   Did you ever send him any text

              14  messages, Dr. Holland, that you can recall?

              15          A.   I'm sure I did.  I don't remember

              16  the details of it, but I'm sure I did.

              17          Q.   And would that be typically

              18  something you would do, when you had a patient

              19  that you referred to Dr. Holland, that you

              20  might text him for a status or update?

              21          A.   Sometimes.  I would rarely make

              22  that my, you know, go to way of, you know,

              23  doing a consultation, if ever.  My text

              24  message communication with doctors, in

              25  general, would be, you know, if they had a



                                                               70


               1  question for me, or an update, or I needed to

               2  convey something to them.  Again, some doctors

               3  liked it, some didn't.  I don't really

               4  remember Dr. Holland being a text person per

               5  se, but again, I would not at all be surprised

               6  if we have some texts back and forth over the

               7  years.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Do you -- do you recall --

               9  by you -- you seem to have a recollection of

              10  referring doctor patient -- Dr. Holland

              11  patients over the course of the years that he

              12  was at Mercy; is that correct?

              13          A.   That's correct.

              14          Q.   So from time to time, if you

              15  believed that a patient -- strike that.

              16             What type of cases did you refer to

              17  Dr. Holland, if you can recall?

              18          A.   The overview answer would be

              19  cases I thought he could handle and do well,

              20  as if it was my own father.  More

              21  specifically, again, more complicated cases,

              22  or minimally invasive, I would definitely not.

              23  But other than that, again, as long as I felt

              24  he could do a good job on this, what would

              25  probably be, safe to say, fairly more



                                                               71


               1  straightforward cases, yes, I would refer

               2  patients to him.

               3          Q.   Now, did you ever -- now, you

               4  said more straightforward cases.  Did you ever

               5  refer any complicated case to Dr. Holland,

               6  that you would deem to be complicated?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   What year?

               9          A.   So, again, early on, when I

              10  didn't know him, or his -- his quality, I

              11  certainly referred complicated cases to him.

              12          Q.   And if the data showed that over

              13  the course of time that Dr. Holland was at

              14  Mercy that you only referred one case to him

              15  the entire time he was there, would -- would

              16  you contest that?

              17          A.   I would be very surprised by

              18  that.

              19             Which, by the way, for the record,

              20  ref -- so calling Dr. Holland to say, hey, I

              21  think you should do this case, and when he

              22  would refuse the case, what I would consider a

              23  referral, but it wouldn't show up on your

              24  record as a referral, because he never did the

              25  case.  So there were instances where I called



                                                               72


               1  him, asked him his thoughts, and he said, oh,

               2  gosh, I think that's too hard.  I -- I don't

               3  know, let's not do that.  Sometimes that, I --

               4  I agreed with him and thought that was the

               5  right thing.  Probably more often I referred

               6  to other CT surgeons, who then said, no, no,

               7  no, we can do this, and so the cases were

               8  done.

               9             So again, probably the only data

              10  you're talking about is ones he actually did.

              11          Q.   Now, you said -- well, yeah.

              12  Well -- now, let's talk about the refusals.

              13  How many times do you recall referring a case

              14  to Dr. Holland and then him refusing it?

              15          A.   I would say at least two or three

              16  times, I could say with good confidence.  It

              17  may have been four or five times, but at least

              18  two or three times.

              19          Q.   And when was -- and when were

              20  these?

              21          A.   Early on.

              22          Q.   Do you recall the year?

              23          A.   Probably '13, '14, early on in my

              24  experience with Dr. Holland.

              25          Q.   So he was rejecting referrals



                                                               73


               1  from you, and you would talk to him on the

               2  phone?

               3          A.   Sometimes on the phone.  Again,

               4  sometimes in person at St. Vincent's Hospital.

               5  Or, by the way, it wouldn't necessarily be

               6  directly.  Sometimes he would see the patient

               7  in the office, and then he would call me back

               8  and say, gosh, I don't know, I'm not sure it's

               9  a good idea, and -- and so, again, sometimes I

              10  would agree with him and say, okay, fine,

              11  maybe we won't do it.  Probably more often we

              12  would agree to disagree, and I would go a

              13  different direction.

              14          Q.   And that's because Dr. Holland

              15  wasn't known for doing -- he couldn't do

              16  complicated cases, correct?

              17          A.   I don't know if he was known, so

              18  to speak.  All I know is when he would refer

              19  -- refuse complicated cases, that made me feel

              20  that he was not confident doing complicated

              21  cases.

              22          Q.   Well, let me ask you what you

              23  heard from anyone else.  I mean, did -- did

              24  anyone else ever tell you that Dr. Holland was

              25  not qualified or incapable of doing



                                                               74


               1  complicated cases?

               2          A.   So I can think of one example

               3  very clearly.

               4          Q.   A person?  Okay.  Who was the

               5  person who said it?

               6          A.   Dr. Letcher.

               7          Q.   Dr. Letcher.  And who is

               8  Dr. Letcher?

               9          A.   He's a cardiologist with

              10  ProMedica.

              11          Q.   And what is his first name?

              12          A.   John, I believe.

              13          Q.   And when did you speak to

              14  Don -- John Letcher about Dr. Holland?

              15          A.   So, again, I'm going back to the

              16  -- this is the first case that I referred to

              17  Dr. Holland, so I believe probably within the

              18  first few months of him joining in '13.

              19  Certainly probably would have been, at latest,

              20  in '14.

              21          Q.   You had a conversation with John

              22  Letcher.  And what type of doctor is

              23  John Letcher?

              24          A.   Interventional cardiologist.

              25          Q.   And what conversation did you



                                                               75


               1  have with him --

               2          A.   So again, to my --

               3          Q.   -- about Dr. Holland?

               4          A.   Go ahead, I'm sorry.

               5          Q.   You said you talked to him about

               6  Dr. Holland?

               7          A.   Yes.

               8          Q.   Okay.  What -- what did he --

               9  what did you talk about with him and

              10  Dr. Holland in 2013 or early 2014?

              11          A.   So I had seen this patient.  He

              12  was, again, 50s roughly, had a pretty severe,

              13  leaky valve.  His heart was weak, probably

              14  around 30 percent or so.  And he had a, to my

              15  recollection, two or three bypasses that

              16  needed to be done.  I think it was just two,

              17  but anyway, I did the heart cath up at

              18  St. Vincent's Hospital.  I said who's here,

              19  and they said, you know, Dr. Holland.  I said,

              20  sure, let's consult him.

              21             I spoke with him on the case.  And

              22  again, 50s, these are dream patients, in their

              23  50s.  Didn't have diabetes or other

              24  complicating problems, and so didn't have

              25  kidney issues.



                                                               76


               1             So anyway, Dr. Holland said, yeah,

               2  absolutely, I'd be happy to see him, I think

               3  we can get this taken care of, and we'll get

               4  it set up, and I'll let you know how it goes,

               5  which I was happy with.

               6             And then the day of his surgery,

               7  which was about two weeks later, I get a call

               8  from the patient, who says, Dr. Holland

               9  cancelled my surgery today, the day of the

              10  surgery.  To which I said, okay, well, let me

              11  -- I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation.

              12  Let me see what I can find out.  And so I

              13  called Dr. Holland, and he said, oh, gosh, I

              14  don't know.  You know, I was looking at his

              15  films, and his heart is weak, and you know, I

              16  know he's in his 50s, but I just -- I just

              17  don't know.  Tell you what, why don't you talk

              18  to an interventional cardiologist, see if they

              19  would be willing to put a couple of stents in

              20  those blockages, and that way, after you, you

              21  know, fix the blockages, and maybe his heart

              22  gets a little bit stronger, then I'll do

              23  surgery on the valve.

              24             And I said, well, that's pretty

              25  unusual.  I mean, if somebody needs a valve,



                                                               77


               1  then we would -- and they also need, you know,

               2  bypass surgery of the -- of the blockages, we

               3  would almost always do those together.

               4             And he says, well, I know, but I

               5  just -- I just think it might be best to kind

               6  of piece this up, and you know, and I said,

               7  okay.  I'll talk to an interventional

               8  cardiologist.

               9             So that's when I spoke with John

              10  Letcher.  I was actually at St. Vincent's at

              11  the time.  Again, this is like -- the next day

              12  I was going up to St. Vincent's, and I saw

              13  John Letcher in the hallway, who is a very

              14  well-respected interventional cardiologist, 20

              15  plus years experience.  And so I said, hey,

              16  would you mind reviewing a case with me.

              17  Dr. Holland asked me to -- to get a second

              18  opinion here on whether, how we should do

              19  this.  And so I told him the story, the case,

              20  I showed him the pictures.  I absolutely did

              21  not influence him in any way.  And I said,

              22  what do you think?  And he said, to the best

              23  quote that I can think of, I think you need to

              24  find yourself another surgeon, because any

              25  surgeon who would not do the bypass in this



                                                               78


               1  case is probably not fit to do the valve

               2  either.

               3             So that was one of my first

               4  takeaways from Dr. Holland, and to which I --

               5  I don't remember the details of how I relayed

               6  that back to Dr. Holland, but the short was I

               7  met with the patient.  I said, hey, I think

               8  I'd like to have you see a different surgeon.

               9  I spoke with Dr. Hashmi.  He reviewed the

              10  case.  He said, no problem, we'll take care of

              11  it.  He had the surgery done, and I still see

              12  that patient to this day, who's doing great.

              13          Q.   Okay.  So this was a patient in

              14  their -- their 50s, that you called a dream

              15  patient for surgery?

              16          A.   In general, the younger they are,

              17  the -- the better cases they are.

              18          Q.   How many years have you been

              19  seeing this patient, prior to them presenting

              20  for this potential surgery?

              21          A.   Quite briefly, less than a month.

              22          Q.   And so what you're saying is that

              23  Dr. Holland want -- suggested that there be --

              24  that the patient should be stented instead,

              25  first?



                                                               79


               1          A.   That's correct.

               2          Q.   And that his explanation to you

               3  is that essentially he wanted the patient to

               4  be more stable before having the surgery?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               6  misrepresentation.

               7          A.   Could you repeat the question?

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Ms. Court Reporter,

               9  can you read it back, please?

              10             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

              11  back the requested testimony.)

              12          A.   I think my -- essentially what --

              13  what I would take away from what he said was

              14  that he didn't feel like he could do the case

              15  safely, as is, and so he'd prefer me to have

              16  him get stented, and after that, then do the

              17  surgery.

              18          Q.   And in terms of the safety issue,

              19  did he explain to you what he thought the

              20  problem was that would cause potentially an

              21  increased risk to the patient of death, if the

              22  surgery was performed right then?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              24  misrepresentation of the record.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Mark the record,



                                                               80


               1  please.

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Please mark it.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Okay.

               4          A.   So again, I apologize, could you

               5  read back the question?

               6          Q.   Yes, please.

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Ms. Court Reporter,

               8  if you could read it back.

               9             (Whereupon, the court reporter read

              10  back the requested testimony.)

              11          A.   I'll do the best I can with this

              12  to hopefully get you the answer you, or the --

              13  my understanding of the situation, anyway.

              14  And that is that he just felt, in general,

              15  that the weakness of the heart, the blockages

              16  in his coronary arteries, combined with the

              17  severity of the leaky valve, that he could not

              18  do it safely, and it would be wiser if it was

              19  done, he only did the surgery after the -- the

              20  bypass grafts were, I'm sorry, the blocked

              21  arteries were stented.

              22             So back -- back to directly your

              23  question, I don't remember any of the details

              24  about why he didn't want to do it, other than

              25  he didn't feel comfortable that he could do it



                                                               81


               1  safely for the patient.

               2          Q.   Dr. Bruhl, at the time that this

               3  patient presented to you, was the patient in

               4  heart failure?

               5          A.   A degree of heart failure, sure.

               6          Q.   And are there instances that you

               7  know of where a patient's heart failure, or

               8  the condition that they're in, would be a -- a

               9  contraindicator to surgery, at least on a

              10  temporary basis?

              11          A.   Yes, I think that would be true.

              12  There are instances.

              13          Q.   And so there are instances, are

              14  there not, where a patient's medical condition

              15  is such with their, the stage of their heart

              16  failure, that you treat them for maybe even a

              17  month or two, and then bring them back for

              18  surgery; is that right?

              19          A.   That can potentially be true,

              20  yes.

              21          Q.   So at least as to this patient,

              22  Dr. Holland appears to have been the camp of

              23  he believed that the patient should be treated

              24  more conservatively first, and then the

              25  surgery performed later, correct?



                                                               82


               1          A.   No.  I -- I don't think that's

               2  the case at all.  If he would have said, let's

               3  treat his heart failure, and then I'll do the

               4  bypass grafts, and the valve, then I think

               5  that could be true.

               6             What he said is, I don't want to do

               7  the case at all, as is, fix the valve, the

               8  blockage problems first, and I only want to do

               9  the valve problem.

              10          Q.   Well, did -- Dr. Holland's a

              11  surgeon, correct?

              12          A.   That's correct.

              13          Q.   And do you believe -- you believe

              14  that during your conversation with him, he did

              15  or did not talk to you about surgical risk or

              16  operative risk?

              17          A.   Whether that word was brought up,

              18  I probably doubt that.  Again, the best I can

              19  do for you is, from that conversation, he

              20  conveyed to me that he did not feel that he

              21  could do the surgery safely, as is with the

              22  patient in their current condition with the,

              23  again, with a valve and the blockages.

              24          Q.   Now, after that patient, did you

              25  -- you -- you said that you believed you did



                                                               83


               1  refer Dr. Holland additional patients?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3          Q.   So despite that interaction with

               4  him, you continued to refer him patients?

               5          A.   I referred patients that I felt

               6  that could safely be done by Dr. Holland,

               7  given the skill set that I was aware of.

               8          Q.   Now, the skill set you were aware

               9  of was that interaction with Dr. Holland,

              10  where he said in that instance he didn't feel

              11  -- just the -- strike that.

              12             The interaction you described with

              13  the patient in 2013, other than that patient,

              14  was there any other patient, at that point in

              15  time, that you had to evaluate Dr. Holland's

              16  quality or his surgical abilities?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   You had -- you had previously

              19  referred him --

              20          A.   Oh, previous -- I'm sorry.  I

              21  thought you said after that.  No, forgive me.

              22  No, I don't remember any.  There may have been

              23  other cases previously, but I don't remember

              24  previous cases before that.

              25          Q.   So at that point in time, that's



                                                               84


               1  the only case you had to evaluate either his

               2  surgical ability, or his quality -- quality

               3  and outcome, that you can think of?

               4          A.   That I can think of off the top

               5  of my head, that's correct.

               6          Q.   So you based your evaluation of

               7  his quality, or his surgical abilities, based

               8  upon a case that he did not actually perform?

               9          A.   That was certainly one of the

              10  deciding factors on the assessment of his

              11  quality.

              12          Q.   What did -- what do you think

              13  brought him to Mercy to begin with?  Why do

              14  you think Dr. Holland came and began working

              15  at Mercy in any capacity?

              16             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              17  speculation.

              18          A.   I have absolutely no idea.  I

              19  assume that he wanted to do CT surgery.

              20          Q.   You indicated that Dr. Holland --

              21  it was one of many factors you used in

              22  determining Dr. Holland's quality -- quality,

              23  was your interactions with him about the

              24  patient you described in 2013.  What -- what

              25  were the others, if any?



                                                               85


               1          A.   So I think my overall impression

               2  of Dr. Holland, like most impressions of most

               3  doctors that I evaluate over time, is

               4  something that develops over years, over

               5  multiple experiences.  Some of those

               6  experiences are very memorable, especially

               7  when I think they're far out of normal.  Other

               8  ones, I don't remember.  So although I have no

               9  doubt in my mind whatsoever I did refer other

              10  patients to him, I did have outcomes from

              11  other patients with him.  I certainly had

              12  feedback from both patients and primary care

              13  doctors about his care.

              14             If -- and I -- again, I don't

              15  remember any other specific examples, provided

              16  one, which I don't know will add a whole lot

              17  of value, but if you would like, I can tell

              18  you the only other case specifically I can

              19  remember of a questionable outcome with

              20  Dr. Holland.  Actually, two.  I can think of

              21  two now.  Would you like me to tell you those?

              22          Q.   Yeah.  If you can remember any --

              23  any interactions with him, where you think

              24  that you referred him patients, other than

              25  this person in 2013.



                                                               86


               1          A.   Okay.

               2          Q.   By all means, tell me what --

               3          A.   So --

               4          Q.   -- first leads you to believe you

               5  referred a patient to him.

               6          A.   Yeah.

               7          Q.   And then second, what you can

               8  recall about --

               9          A.   Okay.  Yeah, it will be brief,

              10  because I don't remember a lot of details

              11  about it, but then we can just say that's all

              12  I remember.

              13             But the only other situation is I

              14  do remember sitting in my office, getting a

              15  call from Dr. Holland, and saying, hey, that

              16  patient you referred me, I'm in the OR right

              17  now.  You know, I don't think that right

              18  coronary is very big, and you know, I really

              19  think it might cause more problems if I, you

              20  know, do the bypass, so I'm just telling you,

              21  I really don't think I should do it, so you

              22  know, just so -- don't be surprised, you know,

              23  when he comes back and he doesn't get that

              24  right coronary done.  I think it might be more

              25  risk than benefit.  To which I would always



                                                               87


               1  say to a surgeon, inside the operating room,

               2  if they're there, and I'm here, do what he

               3  thinks is best.  I certainly wouldn't try and

               4  doing something he thought was wrong at the

               5  time, but that is one example I remember.

               6             And the only other one, and again,

               7  this really covers all I remember specifically

               8  about cases, is I got a call from one of the

               9  primary care doctors, Dr. Felton, if you want

              10  to know the name, and said, who is this

              11  Holland guy?  To which I said, what is -- what

              12  is the issue?  And he says, gosh, I just got

              13  one of my patients back.  I went to the

              14  surgical report.  He did this crazy surgery

              15  that hasn't been done in 20 years.  I had to

              16  research it.  Where he cut half the left

              17  ventricle open, and he cut out half the cor,

              18  you know, a fourth of the left ventricle, and

              19  he sewed it back together.  That -- that is a

              20  surgery that nobody does anymore.  And so I

              21  don't know if he's ahead of his time, or he's

              22  just way behind his time, but considering the

              23  guy's not doing that good, I'm wondering if

              24  that was a good idea or not.

              25             And he -- I think he said something



                                                               88


               1  to the effect of, I think we ought to keep an

               2  eye on this guy.  I'm not exactly sure his --

               3  his skills are up to -- to date.  And I said,

               4  okay, well, we'll -- we'll keep an eye on him,

               5  and that was the only other interaction I

               6  remember specifically about a patient that

               7  Dr. Holland did.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Dr. Bruhl, I just want to

               9  go back to the first patient just really

              10  quickly.  Thank you -- thank you for those,

              11  and I'll just -- I'll walk through these

              12  quickly.

              13             The first patient, you got a call

              14  when Dr. Holland was in the operating room,

              15  correct?

              16          A.   You are talking about the right

              17  coronary case I spoke about?

              18          Q.   Yes.  The first one that you

              19  mentioned just now.

              20          A.   Yes.  I -- it was my impression I

              21  felt pretty confident -- I feel pretty

              22  confident that's true that he was calling me

              23  from the operating room.

              24          Q.   Yeah.  And that -- and that's not

              25  -- that's nothing that would be necessarily



                                                               89


               1  unusual.  A surgeon can and does do that, call

               2  --

               3          A.   That's correct.

               4          Q.   -- the cardiologists -- sorry.

               5  Did you get some feedback?

               6          A.   That's my fault.  I'm sorry.

               7          Q.   No, that's okay.  That is not

               8  unusual, that a surgeon might do that, call

               9  the cardiologist, if they're seeing something

              10  unanticipated, correct?

              11          A.   That -- that is correct.

              12          Q.   In fact, that is something that

              13  would be, in some instances, preferred to do

              14  that, to get the opinion of the cardiologist

              15  when they're seeing something?

              16          A.   Yes, I would agree.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And then on the second

              18  one, Dr. Felton, now, where is Dr. Felton

              19  located, by the way?

              20          A.   He's a primary care doctor in

              21  Tiffin, Ohio.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And Tiffin, I don't know

              23  what your population is.  Is it a small,

              24  small, nice little town in Ohio?

              25          A.   It's relatively small, rural



                                                               90


               1  community, yes.

               2          Q.   How long -- how big is Tiffin,

               3  really?  Like how many people?

               4          A.   I am embarrassed to tell you, I

               5  do not know the answer to that.

               6          Q.   All right.  Well, we'll look it

               7  up at some point, but it's more of a, less

               8  than 100,000 probably in Tiffin itself?

               9          A.   If that was the number, I would

              10  believe it.

              11          Q.   Okay.  I don't -- I would have to

              12  look it up.  Maybe we could do that while

              13  we're here, but the -- Dr. Felton was a

              14  primary -- is a primary care in the Tiffin

              15  area, correct?

              16          A.   That's correct.

              17          Q.   And the operation that Dr. Felton

              18  was referring to, do you know if that is known

              19  as a ventricular aneurysm repair?

              20          A.   I do not believe that was the --

              21  the case.  I, again, I'll do the best I can,

              22  but I believe he had ischemic dilated

              23  cardiomyopathy, which means the heart is

              24  enlarged or stretched out.  And I do know in

              25  the past, there was some feeling that perhaps



                                                               91


               1  cutting down the size of the left ventricle,

               2  to reshape it, may be of some value.

               3             I will admit that in my 18 years of

               4  being in medicine, including medical school, I

               5  do not remember a single case being done that

               6  way at UT Medical Center, or any other

               7  hospital.

               8          Q.   Well, let's -- let's go back for

               9  a second.  Do you know what an enlarged or

              10  stretched-out heart, whether that means that a

              11  person has an aneurysm?

              12          A.   It can mean, but it does not

              13  mean, does not mean that they do.

              14          Q.   Did the echo in the operating

              15  room show that, or do you know whether or not

              16  the echo in the operating room with this

              17  patient showed dyskinesis?

              18          A.   I'm not privy to the -- I don't

              19  remember, or what the echo in the operating

              20  room was done, was done, or what it showed.

              21          Q.   Do you know what dyskinesis is?

              22          A.   Yes, I do.

              23          Q.   What is it?

              24          A.   It means the heart is going the

              25  wrong direction, when it's supposed to be



                                                               92


               1  going, contracting in, it's going out.

               2          Q.   And is that -- is that an

               3  indication that there is an aneurysm?

               4          A.   It does not mean there is an

               5  aneurysm, but it can mean there is an

               6  aneurysm.

               7          Q.   Okay.  So -- so what we have

               8  talked about, the enlarged, or stretched-out

               9  heart, plus dyskinesis, those two factors

              10  could indicate that there is an aneurysm?

              11          A.   I'm not going to go through the

              12  definition of aneurysm with you, but I will

              13  restate what I said before, that dyskinesis

              14  can be part of an aneurysm, but it does not

              15  mean that there is an aneurysm.

              16          Q.   Now, in terms of -- do you know

              17  what a -- do you know how complicated a

              18  procedure a ventricular aneurysm repair is?

              19          A.   I'm sure it's challenging.

              20          Q.   Do you know how -- how -- how

              21  frequently those are -- are performed in the

              22  United States?

              23          A.   No, I do not.

              24          Q.   Are you suggesting that a doctor

              25  who performs a ventricular aneurysm repair is



                                                               93


               1  engaged in junk or pseudoscience, just because

               2  they engage in a procedure that's highly

               3  complicated and rare?

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form.

               5          A.   I did not suggest that at all.  I

               6  told you what Dr. Felton said.

               7          Q.   All right.  Well, I understand.

               8  Doctor, that's fair that you said that.  Just

               9  asking you, this patient that we talked to,

              10  talking about, what is the status today?  The

              11  patient still alive, or do you know?

              12          A.   I do not know.

              13          Q.   Did the patient continue to treat

              14  with you thereafter?  Doctor -- how did -- was

              15  this Dr. Felton's patient?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Did Dr. Felton report back to you

              18  about how the patient was doing thereafter?

              19          A.   I do not remember any specific

              20  updates to that patient.

              21          Q.   Okay.  Do you know how old that

              22  patient was, roughly speaking, or no?

              23          A.   I could only speculate, but I

              24  really don't know.

              25          Q.   Oh, don't want you to do that.



                                                               94


               1  Fair enough.

               2             Okay.  Now, other than those two

               3  that you can think of, anything else you can

               4  think of in terms of cases you interacted with

               5  Dr. Holland on before RR's case?

               6          A.   I know I keep saying that I can't

               7  think of one, but one more small one, just for

               8  completeness sake here.

               9          Q.   Sure.

              10          A.   Is I was doing a case more

              11  recently, and this actually was after 2017,

              12  after that RR case, where I was doing a heart

              13  cath case at St. Vincent's Hospital, and

              14  Dr. Phillips and Dr. Holland came down

              15  concerned, let's go with very concerned, about

              16  the outcome of a surgery, surgery case that

              17  they had done.  And I don't know specifically

              18  if it was Phillips or Holland or both.  I

              19  guess I had a feeling they both had done it,

              20  but it looked like they were having a heart

              21  attack, and they wanted consultation on the

              22  EKG, and whether it was or not a heart attack,

              23  and whether they did or not need to go for an

              24  emergency stenting.  But that is, like I said,

              25  the only -- only other memory I have of -- of



                                                               95


               1  them.

               2          Q.   Do you know if that was

               3  Dr. Hashmi's case, and Dr. Phillips and

               4  Dr. Holland were attempting to remedy a

               5  situation?

               6          A.   I got the impression it was their

               7  own case, but I do not know for sure.

               8          Q.   All right.  Fair enough.

               9             Any other cases you can think of,

              10  other than RR?

              11          A.   I don't think so, other than I've

              12  mentioned already.

              13          Q.   It's 11:24.  I don't know what

              14  time we took the last break.  Can we take a

              15  little bit of a break for restroom right now,

              16  if that's fair to you?  And then I'll switch

              17  topics, and then I'll try to wrap it up in

              18  this next go-around.  Might still be an hour,

              19  but I hope not.  Okay?

              20          A.   Okay.

              21          Q.   Thank you.

              22          A.   Thank you.

              23             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off record.

              24             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              25  11:25 until 11:37.)



                                                               96


               1             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We're

               2  back on record.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, we

               4  talked about patients that you recall having

               5  interactions with Dr. Holland on, or even the

               6  instance of Dr. Felton, who had interactions,

               7  or had a Dr. Holland patient, correct?  We

               8  talked about those?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Now, with regard to the 2013

              11  case, you judged quality, you had an

              12  indication of quality or surgical ability,

              13  based upon the fact that Dr. Holland did not

              14  want to do that procedure, correct?

              15          A.   That certainly was some part of

              16  my information of his quality.

              17          Q.   Okay.  And then the next case you

              18  mentioned was the one where he called you from

              19  the OR itself, correct?

              20          A.   I did mention that as another

              21  example.

              22          Q.   Okay.  But that one, you're not

              23  -- you're -- are you -- did you -- do you

              24  believe that there is a lack of quality,

              25  because he called you from the OR?



                                                               97


               1          A.   The calling from the OR, it

               2  certainly had nothing to do with quality.  The

               3  fact that he couldn't, or wouldn't, do the

               4  bypass, I would say, in general, does not

               5  always mean lack of quality, but the relative

               6  frequency in which he did not do the bypass to

               7  the right coronary artery, certainly would

               8  indicate less than ideal level of quality.

               9          Q.   Okay.  But I'm just talking about

              10  your one, the one he called you from the OR.

              11          A.   So repeat the question.

              12          Q.   When he called you from the OR,

              13  did that call indicate to you a lack of

              14  quality on his part?

              15          A.   Yes.  To some degree, yes.

              16          Q.   And that's because when he got

              17  in, because he was actually in the OR seeing

              18  the patient's heart, and you weren't, and he

              19  decided, or want -- did not want to bypass one

              20  of the areas that you had identified that you

              21  wanted bypassed?

              22          A.   So like I said earlier, that the

              23  overall impression of a doctor's quality is

              24  more than singlisis at times.  It's overall

              25  attitude.  And specifically if you're asking



                                                               98


               1  me about whether his bypass of right coronary

               2  arteries, or lack of bypass of right coronary

               3  arteries, which, of course, this is an

               4  example, made me think he was a better doctor,

               5  or a worse doctor, I would certainly say that

               6  in general, when patients came back with a

               7  much higher percentage of cases not having

               8  right coronaries bypassed, including this

               9  case, but not limited to this case, that would

              10  in general make me think that his quality was

              11  less than others, who had a much higher

              12  percentage of doing right coronary bypasses.

              13             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.  I'm going to

              14  move to strike that answer as nonresponsive.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Doctor, I'm

              16  asking you about the specific patient right

              17  now.  We'll talk about these so-called other

              18  patients later, but we're talking about this

              19  specific patient.  And I'm wondering what your

              20  saying is, did you have a belief, prior to

              21  getting this call in the OR, that there was

              22  some issue with Dr. Holland and not performing

              23  bypasses, yet you still referred him this

              24  patient?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,



                                                               99


               1  argumentative also.

               2          A.   I so apologize.  Could you please

               3  repeat the question?

               4          Q.   Yeah.  Previously, you indicated

               5  if you referred a patient to someone, you

               6  know, you would have to have the standard

               7  that, you know, you felt comfortable having

               8  your father operated on, correct?

               9          A.   That's correct.

              10          Q.   (Unintelligible.)

              11             THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry.  Wait a

              12  minute.

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And so

              14  Dr. Holland calls you from the operating room

              15  --

              16             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason -- Jason.

              17          Q.   -- (By Mr. Archinaco)

              18  (Unintelligible), referred to him, correct?

              19             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason, you broke up.

              20  The court reporter couldn't get your -- the

              21  whole question.

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay, I'm sorry.

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) In this

              24  instance, you referred Dr. Holland a patient,

              25  and he called you from the OR, correct?



                                                               100


               1          A.   Correct.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And you referred him a

               3  patient you didn't think he was competent to

               4  perform a surgery on, correct?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

               6          A.   No, that's not correct.

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  --

               8  mischaracterization.

               9          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You thought,

              10  prior to referring this patient to him, you

              11  thought Dr. Holland was incompetent, correct?

              12             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              13  mischaracterization, argumentative.

              14          A.   I certainly never said that.

              15          Q.   Okay.  So -- so you referred him

              16  this patient, believing he was competent to

              17  perform the procedure?

              18          A.   Because this was a

              19  straightforward, simple case.  Yes, I felt

              20  that he could handle this straightforward,

              21  simple case.

              22          Q.   Three bypass case?

              23          A.   It was -- I don't remember the

              24  exact number, but it was two or three, but

              25  either way, two or three in general is



                                                               101


               1  straightforward usually.

               2          Q.   And what do you recall from the

               3  patient's risk factors?

               4          A.   I'm sorry, repeat, what did you

               5  say?

               6          Q.   What do you recall from the

               7  patient's risk factors?

               8          A.   I don't remember any details of

               9  risk factors.

              10          Q.   Do you recall what it was about

              11  the presentation in the operating room, that

              12  you were not present to see, that caused

              13  Dr. Holland not to perform that one bypass?

              14          A.   Again, I'll do the best I can.

              15  From the conversation, I got the feeling that,

              16  hey, things aren't going great, and I think if

              17  maybe we, you know, do this last bypass, it

              18  can cause problems.  And by the way, it's not

              19  that big anyway, so I just want you to know

              20  that I'm not going to do it, so that's all I

              21  know.  As far as other details of blood

              22  pressure, and that kind of stuff, I have -- I

              23  do not have any details.

              24          Q.   Do you know whether or not the

              25  artery that you had requested being bypassed



                                                               102


               1  was actually calcified and had been closed for

               2  years and was incapable of being bypassed?

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               4  foundation.

               5          A.   Again, I'll do the best.  I hope

               6  you'll accept this.  My best -- only thing I

               7  can say about the details of this case is I

               8  reviewed the case with Dr. Holland ahead of

               9  time.  In the vast majority of cases, although

              10  I'll admit not all the time, in the vast

              11  majority of cases, we can know ahead of time

              12  whether the artery is calcified, how big the

              13  artery is, whether it can or cannot be done.

              14             Sometimes the answer is we can

              15  never do that, it's too small, we won't do it.

              16  In this case, which goes back to why he was

              17  calling me, he had said, oh, yeah, we can do

              18  that.  That's definitely big enough, and it's

              19  not calcified, and we'll be fine.  But he was

              20  calling me for the sole reason that he was

              21  going back on what he had previously told me,

              22  and we kind of agreed on, would be the best

              23  care for this patient.

              24          Q.   How long had you been treating

              25  this patient, prior to presenting him to --



                                                               103


               1  for surgery?

               2          A.   I do not remember that at all.

               3  I'm sorry.

               4          Q.   Do you know how it was his

               5  medical care was such that he got to a point

               6  of having his right coronary -- by the way, is

               7  the right coronary artery important?

               8          A.   All coronaries are important.

               9          Q.   And the fact that it was

              10  calcified, if the -- if the coronary artery

              11  was calcified, that would have to happen over

              12  a period of time, correct?

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              14  foundation.

              15          A.   There was a couple different

              16  questions through there, so maybe clarify that

              17  question for me.

              18          Q.   The right coronary artery, when

              19  Dr. Holland goes in, is completely calcified.

              20          A.   I didn't say that artery was

              21  completely calcified.

              22          Q.   You don't agree it was?  How do

              23  you know?

              24          A.   I am telling you that I reviewed

              25  the case with Dr. Holland.  Both of us, after



                                                               104


               1  looking at the films, agreed that the artery

               2  was appropriate to bypass.  That is what I

               3  know.  And then I -- and by the way, when he

               4  called me, I absolutely don't remember him

               5  saying anything about calcification.  He said,

               6  oh, gosh, I think it's not going well, and the

               7  artery is kind of small, and so I'm not going

               8  to do it.  So above and beyond that, I -- I

               9  can't comment on any kind of level of calcium.

              10          Q.   What happened with the patient

              11  after the surgery?

              12          A.   I -- I don't believe he died, if

              13  that's what you're asking, but I do not know

              14  the details of his -- his course after that.

              15  I don't remember the specific details of that

              16  case.

              17          Q.   Nothing -- no com -- if there

              18  were complications, that would stand out to

              19  you, given the fact that you can remember him

              20  calling you, correct?

              21          A.   So if there were direct immediate

              22  complications, yes, but not bypassing a right

              23  coronary artery would usually lead to

              24  complications down the line.  That's why I'm

              25  so passionate about trying to get the best



                                                               105


               1  complete revascularization.  They're not

               2  likely to die in the hospital, or in the first

               3  30 days, but their long-term course, without a

               4  doubt in my mind, will be poor.

               5          Q.   Okay.  So yeah, but I'm not --

               6  I'm not asking you that right now, because

               7  you're just trying to give general answers to

               8  questions I'm not asking.

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Questions,

              11  instead of trying to advocate for your

              12  employer.

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.  That's

              14  inappropriate, Jason.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Mark the record,

              16  please.

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Please mark it.

              18  Please mark it.

              19             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason, just -- just

              20  ask a question.  That's all I'm asking you to

              21  do.

              22             MR. ARCHINACO:  Who's speaking

              23  right now?

              24             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jim Brazeau.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Jim, yeah, thanks.



                                                               106


               1  I'm going to move on.  I'll be prepared to ask

               2  a question in a moment.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you recall

               4  any complications in this, with this patient,

               5  that stand out in your mind?  Any at all that

               6  this patient had post-surgery?

               7          A.   I do not remember.

               8          Q.   Do you know whether or not the

               9  patient went on to run any marathons after the

              10  surgery?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              12          A.   I am not aware.

              13          Q.   So the patient may have done well

              14  for all you -- well, strike that.

              15             If there had been a serious

              16  complication -- well, you were the

              17  cardiologist following the patient, right?

              18          A.   To be honest, I cannot even with

              19  great certainty tell you that.  It could have

              20  been my partner's patient.  I was the one that

              21  did the inner -- the heart catheterization,

              22  discussed the planned surgery with

              23  Dr. Holland, and the one that Dr. Holland

              24  called, but I cannot tell you with good

              25  certainty whether that patient ultimately



                                                               107


               1  followed with my partner or with me.

               2          Q.   Who was your partner?

               3          A.   I have had two partners.

               4  Dr. Lenehan, probably at that time, would have

               5  been my partner.

               6          Q.   And who is your other partner?

               7          A.   Currently Dr. Ali Ahmad is my

               8  partner.

               9          Q.   What happened to Dr. Lenehan?

              10          A.   He went back down to Ohio Health,

              11  after about a year, year and a half or so.

              12          Q.   Do you know why he left?

              13          A.   Said the drive was too much.

              14          Q.   And your current partner, what is

              15  his name again, I'm sorry?

              16          A.   Ali Ahmad.

              17          Q.   And is Ali Ahmad also employed by

              18  Mercy?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   And when you have patients with

              21  your partner, whether it was Dr. Lenehan or

              22  Dr. Ahmad, did you typically follow those

              23  patients collectively?

              24          A.   No.  We pretty much would follow

              25  our own patients.



                                                               108


               1          Q.   For how many years did you work

               2  with Dr. Lenehan?

               3          A.   I'm going to say roughly probably

               4  about a year and a half.

               5          Q.   What years was that?

               6          A.   Hmm.  I'll do the best I can, but

               7  sometime between probably 2013 and 2015.

               8          Q.   And to the best of your

               9  recollection, you don't recall Dr. Lenehan

              10  ever discussing any complications of the --

              11  with this patient that had surgery that we

              12  talked about, where Dr. Holland called you

              13  from the OR, correct?

              14          A.   I do not remember any specific

              15  feedback beyond what I told you.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Now, the third one that we

              17  were talking about briefly, to mention, is the

              18  one that Dr. Felton told you about, correct?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   And you did not have any direct,

              21  or did you have any direct -- direct

              22  involvement in that care?

              23          A.   So again, I'll do the best I can.

              24  I told you my knowledge, memory of the --

              25  memory of those experiences were less, but I



                                                               109


               1  think I can say with good confidence that I

               2  almost certainly did the heart catheterization

               3  for that patient.  I really probably believe

               4  that most likely that was Dr. Lenehan's

               5  patient.

               6             And so back to the point, I did not

               7  have, you know, any further feedback on that

               8  patient, beyond that conversation I just told

               9  you.

              10          Q.   Did you have issues with

              11  Dr. Lenehan's, with Dr. Lenehan not

              12  identifying serious heart problems with

              13  patients, and then they were then presented to

              14  the hospital in worse condition as a result?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              16  foundation.

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Do you know why it was that this

              19  patient of Dr. Felt, or sorry.  This doc --

              20  this patient, that you might have done the

              21  heart catheterization on, that Dr. Felton

              22  spoke to you about, do you know why it was

              23  that the patient had gotten to the point where

              24  they needed to have, or did have a complicated

              25  surgical repair on their heart?



                                                               110


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  mischaracterization of the record.

               3          A.   I will again do the best I can

               4  with what I do know, which I think is what

               5  you're asking, if -- and it's all I can tell

               6  you.  Is that Dr. Felton was calling me about

               7  this case, because I, presumably, which I

               8  believe was the case, did the heart

               9  catheterization and referred him on to

              10  Dr. Holland.  He was a little bit dismayed by

              11  how the surgery was done and how the patient

              12  was recovering or not recovering.  That is all

              13  I know.

              14          Q.   Well, how did the patient

              15  ultimately do?

              16          A.   Again, I have told you all I

              17  know.

              18          Q.   Okay.  How do you know that

              19  Dr. Felton was dismayed?

              20          A.   Because he called me and said,

              21  who the heck is this Holland guy, and what is

              22  he doing?  Which went on to say that he was,

              23  thought that in his research of this

              24  procedure, it seemed archaic, and that he was,

              25  in general, fairly unhappy with the recovery



                                                               111


               1  phase of this patient.  And again, I don't

               2  know that he was dismayed as a general term,

               3  but I think he was cautious or concerned that

               4  perhaps the quality of Dr. Holland was -- was

               5  not as good as he would like.

               6          Q.   Do you know whether or not the

               7  procedure itself that he -- that Dr. Holland

               8  performed is not actually archaic, but

               9  actually was state of the art?

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              11  foundation.

              12          A.   So again, repeat the question.

              13  I'm sorry.

              14          Q.   Yes.  Do you know whether or not

              15  the procedure that Dr. Holland performed was

              16  not in fact "archaic" as Dr. Felton said, but

              17  instead was state of the art?

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              19          A.   I know what I've told you.  I

              20  also went on to say earlier, that in my,

              21  whatever, 18 years of being in cardiology and

              22  medicine, I have not seen or heard of any

              23  patients getting that type of procedure, but

              24  that is -- that is what I know.

              25          Q.   Well, do you think that



                                                               112


               1  Dr. Holland invented the procedure that day,

               2  or do you think that the procedure actually

               3  existed prior to him using it that day?

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, relevance,

               5  speculation.

               6          A.   I will tell you what I told you

               7  before, that this surgery had been done

               8  20 years ago by surgeons.  As far as I know,

               9  he did not invent it, but it is not something

              10  that is done, in my experience, as a

              11  cardiologist, by any other cardiologist I have

              12  ever come across.  I'm sorry, cardio --

              13  surgeon, I'm sorry, cardiothoracic surgeon.

              14          Q.   Do you know the difference

              15  between a Batista procedure and a Dor

              16  procedure?

              17          A.   I really am not.  I'm trained in

              18  cardiology, not cardiothoracic surgery.

              19          Q.   So which one -- which procedure

              20  did Dr. Holland perform on the procedure, a

              21  Batista or a Dor?

              22          A.   I don't have the answer to that.

              23          Q.   Do you know whether or not one of

              24  them is archaic and one of them isn't, you

              25  have no idea, right?



                                                               113


               1          A.   If I don't know which case he

               2  did, I don't know which one would be archaic

               3  or not.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

               5             Well, you should have -- you should

               6  have your affidavit in front of you.

               7          A.   Yep.

               8          Q.   Okay.  So in 5A of your affidavit

               9  --

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   -- you talk about the most

              12  egregious example of your professional

              13  conflict with Dr. Holland, correct?

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   And you say here that the family

              16  insisted on using the Cleveland Clinic.

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   And do you -- why is it, to your

              19  knowledge -- well, first of all, you're

              20  talking about patient RR here; is that right?

              21          A.   That's correct.

              22          Q.   And how long was RR a patient of

              23  yours, before he had to have a surgical

              24  procedure?

              25          A.   I would say at least a year,



                                                               114


               1  probably a couple of years.

               2          Q.   And at some point, you determined

               3  or thought that he might need cardiothoracic

               4  surgery; is that right?

               5          A.   That's correct.

               6          Q.   And how did that arise?

               7          A.   So I -- I guess I'll just answer

               8  the question that you asked me.  When he came

               9  into the hospital, after passing out, and I

              10  saw him in the hospital, the first thing I

              11  said to him is, what the heck, why didn't you

              12  call me?  You know what is going to happen,

              13  right?  To which he said, yeah, I know.  I

              14  said, it's almost certain you're going to need

              15  surgery, so that was the first time I was

              16  pretty darn sure.  And then once we did the

              17  echocardiogram, and then the heart

              18  catheterization, that was for sure.

              19          Q.   All right.  So let's -- let's go

              20  back a second.  Why is it that you didn't

              21  notice this condition that he had, prior to

              22  him coming to the hospital and passing out?

              23          A.   So I assume -- well, I'm not

              24  going to assume.  What condition are you

              25  referring to?



                                                               115


               1          Q.   The one that appears that needed

               2  to be corrected by a surgery?

               3          A.   So aortic stenosis.  So I

               4  absolutely knew the condition.  That is a

               5  condition that develops over 10, 20, 30 years

               6  sometimes.  And I remember very clearly having

               7  a discussion with him, roughly three to four

               8  months before this, in regard to his

               9  condition, the aortic stenosis, and the

              10  reality that at some point in the future, it

              11  was not about if, but just when he was going

              12  to need surgery.

              13          Q.   Okay.  So if you knew that, why

              14  didn't you schedule him for an elective

              15  surgery, as opposed to waiting until he passed

              16  out?

              17          A.   So again, as I said, I told him

              18  he would need to at some point, but he had not

              19  met criteria to undergo surgery.

              20          Q.   So you believe the last time that

              21  you had seen him before he appeared at the

              22  hospital passed out, he did not meet criteria

              23  for surgery, but he might meet that criteria

              24  at some point in the future?

              25          A.   That's correct.



                                                               116


               1          Q.   So you were -- you were surprised

               2  by the level of deterioration in his stenosis

               3  over the three to four month period?

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

               5          A.   So my estimation of his

               6  progression would be based on the symptoms he

               7  reported.  And to answer your question, based

               8  on my very poignant discussion with him, three

               9  to four months beforehand, that he could die,

              10  if he was hiding symptoms from me, and that if

              11  he develops shortness of breath, passing out,

              12  or chest pain, he needed to call me right

              13  away, because that means that he probably

              14  needs surgery, and it could be life

              15  threatening.  So when he swore up and down to

              16  me that I have none of those symptoms, I

              17  absolutely feel great, but I will call you

              18  when I have those problems, or if I have those

              19  problems, I scheduled an appointment for six

              20  months, to see him back in six months, but

              21  again, saw him back earlier than six months,

              22  because he came in the hospital.

              23          Q.   So you had performed an

              24  echocardiogram on or -- in December of -- hang

              25  on one second.  I just want to make sure I get



                                                               117


               1  the year.

               2             You performed an echocardiogram in

               3  December of 2016 on this patient, correct?

               4          A.   Do you have a document for me to

               5  view?

               6          Q.   No.  I'm just asking if you

               7  remember.

               8          A.   I probably did, but I honestly do

               9  not know.

              10          Q.   Was this a complicated or

              11  uncomplicated surgery that had to be

              12  performed?

              13          A.   I would say anytime you're doing

              14  an aortic stenosis, with bypass surgery, I

              15  think that always makes it a little more

              16  complicated than a straightforward valve, or

              17  coronary disease, so I would say fairly

              18  complicated case, yes.

              19          Q.   Do you recall noting on an

              20  echocardiogram that he had critical aortic

              21  stenosis?

              22          A.   No, I do not.

              23          Q.   Of 2016?

              24          A.   Would you -- so you're using a --

              25  I'm not trying to be difficult, but you used



                                                               118


               1  the word critical aortic stenosis, which has a

               2  very important definition.  What is the

               3  definition you're referring to?

               4          Q.   The standard definition that

               5  doctors refer to when they talk about critical

               6  aortic stenosis.

               7          A.   So no, I do not believe that to

               8  be true at all.

               9          Q.   Was the -- do you recall the

              10  patient having symptoms of congestive heart

              11  failure when he presented to you in December

              12  of 2016?

              13          A.   December of 2016, you said?

              14          Q.   Yes.

              15          A.   So he had, just like probably

              16  70 percent of all the patients I see, some

              17  level of heart failure that was controlled.

              18  Certainly that would be true, I'm sure, in

              19  December of 2016.

              20          Q.   And so you noted the potential

              21  that he would have to have a valve

              22  replacement; is that right?

              23          A.   That's correct.

              24          Q.   And then instead of referring for

              25  surgery at that time, you prescribed him a



                                                               119


               1  diuretic; is that right?

               2          A.   So I'm sorry, the question is did

               3  I ever prescribe him a diuretic, is that your

               4  question?

               5          Q.   Yes, in or about December of

               6  2016, do you recall --

               7          A.   I would believe that's probably

               8  true.

               9          Q.   -- (unintelligible.)

              10          A.   Okay.  Go ahead.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And do you know whether or

              12  not -- do you know whether or not the use of

              13  long-term diuretic increases the gradient

              14  across the valve?

              15          A.   Certainly could increase the

              16  gradient across the valve, but is completely

              17  100 percent appropriate for the treatment of

              18  heart failure, with or without aortic

              19  stenosis.

              20          Q.   Now, when the patient first

              21  presented to the hospital, which was in or

              22  about -- give me one second -- in or about May

              23  2017, did you see the patient upon his

              24  presentation?

              25          A.   Yes, I believe so.



                                                               120


               1          Q.   So you drove up from Tiffin?

               2          A.   Wait.  I'm sorry.  You're saying

               3  did I see --

               4          Q.   RR, patient RR, were you already

               5  at the hospital, or did you drive from Tiffin

               6  --

               7          A.   When he presented?

               8          Q.   -- to see him?

               9          A.   Sorry.  So I apologize.  Please

              10  rephrase the question, and where we're talking

              11  about.

              12          Q.   Well, okay.  So the doctor --

              13  this gentleman, RR, or sorry, RR, the patient

              14  --

              15          A.   Yep.

              16          Q.   -- where did he present after

              17  passing out?

              18          A.   To Mercy Health-Tiffin Hospital.

              19          Q.   And then you had him transferred?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   His -- was his surgery performed

              22  in Tiffin Hospital?

              23          A.   Ultimate -- I guess I --

              24  ultimately, days later, he was referred, or

              25  was transferred to Tiffin.  I'm sorry,



                                                               121


               1  transferred to St. Vincent's.

               2          Q.   Okay.  So he -- first he presents

               3  to Tiffin Hospital, having passed out?

               4          A.   Correct.

               5          Q.   And is it correct that upon

               6  presentation, he advised that he had had three

               7  such episodes in one week?

               8          A.   That is correct.

               9          Q.   And just as -- the medical term

              10  syncopal.  I don't know how to pronounce it --

              11          A.   Syncope.

              12          Q.   -- I'm sorry, S-Y-N-C-O-P-A-L.

              13  Syncopal episodes, syncopal -- I don't know

              14  how to pronounce it.

              15          A.   So syncope or syncopal.

              16          Q.   Okay.  That's what -- he had

              17  three of those in a week?

              18          A.   That is what he reported.  And I

              19  --

              20          Q.   And so I --

              21          A.   -- would slightly characterize

              22  that as syncope -- again, can I --

              23          Q.   Yes, please do.  I'm sorry for --

              24          A.   Sorry.  I think I would say that

              25  he had syncope/near syncope.  In other words,



                                                               122


               1  he close to fell out, passed out three times.

               2  The last time, he did actually pass out.  But

               3  he had two previous episodes that were near

               4  passing out.  The third one was actually

               5  passing out.

               6          Q.   Okay.

               7          A.   So syncope/near syncope, three

               8  episodes, yes.

               9          Q.   When you saw the patient at

              10  Tiffin Hospital, who was present with you, if

              11  anyone?

              12          A.   Again, I saw him over a couple of

              13  days, so lots of people were probably with me,

              14  but are you speaking about a specific incident

              15  over those two or three days?

              16          Q.   No.  Let's go back.  So

              17  basically, he comes in.  He's admitted to the

              18  hospital.  He's put under observation in

              19  Tiffin for a couple of days, and then

              20  transferred to St. Vincent; is that right?

              21          A.   That's correct.

              22          Q.   And did a gentleman named

              23  Adam Carruthers see a patient with you in

              24  Tiffin?

              25          A.   No.



                                                               123


               1          Q.   Did he see the patient with you

               2  in Mercy-St. Vincent?

               3          A.   I have no knowledge of that.

               4          Q.   You don't recall ever -- do you

               5  know who Adam Carruthers is?

               6          A.   I do know who it is.  Only by

               7  name and maybe I would recognize him, but

               8  don't know him personally.

               9          Q.   Now, when you transferred the

              10  patient to St. Vincent, what did you do in

              11  terms of indicating who would perform the

              12  surgery, if anybody?

              13          A.   So I spoke with Dr. Hashmi

              14  directly on the phone, relayed the facts of

              15  the case, including the bypass and the -- the

              16  echocardiograph results and his presentation.

              17  I relayed the fact that the patient was

              18  somewhat resistant to coming to -- to

              19  St. Vincent's at all.  They were fairly

              20  adamant about going to Cleveland Clinic, but I

              21  had told him that, the patient and the family,

              22  that if my own father needed this surgery

              23  done, I would not go to Cleveland Clinic, I

              24  would go to Dr. Hashmi.

              25             And based on that, and that alone,



                                                               124


               1  is the only reason the patient and the family

               2  agreed to be transferred to St. Vincent's

               3  Hospital to be done by Dr. Hashmi on Monday.

               4  They were aware of that prior to the transfer

               5  and in agreement with it.

               6          Q.   Why did the family advise you

               7  that they were insistent upon using or talking

               8  about using Cleveland Clinic?

               9          A.   This isn't too unusual, and of

              10  course, I don't know for sure their thinking,

              11  but in general, they were familiar with the

              12  name.  And I think the son lived in Cleveland,

              13  and so big name, I live near Cleveland, why

              14  don't we, you know, take our chance on -- on

              15  the big name and just closer to his son.  But

              16  I honestly don't really know anything.  That's

              17  just speculation to a certain degree.

              18          Q.   They didn't say, they didn't give

              19  you a reason, they just said, we would prefer

              20  Cleveland Clinic?

              21          A.   That's correct.

              22          Q.   And then you said, your

              23  recommendation was, no, transfer to

              24  Mercy-St. Vincent because Dr. Hashmi could do

              25  it?



                                                               125


               1          A.   So what I said, and I have this

               2  conversation frequently with patients, I say,

               3  okay, who do you know at Cleveland Clinic?  To

               4  which most of them say, I don't know.  To

               5  which I say, I also don't know anybody at

               6  Cleveland Clinic, including the surgeon.  So

               7  absolutely, if you prefer, I can transfer the

               8  patient to Cleveland Clinic.  They will take

               9  you, I'm pretty darn sure, and you will get

              10  whoever is in line.  Whoever the next doc is

              11  that's on the docket, it might be the best doc

              12  in the country, or the world.  It may be the

              13  guy that just graduated, and is not good at

              14  all, or maybe the guy who should have retired

              15  a year ago.  We don't know.  You're

              16  absolutely, if you want, you can take your

              17  chances on that.  But I will tell you that if

              18  my own father needed surgery today, and your

              19  dad was my father, I would trust somebody I

              20  know, who does a great job, and that would be

              21  Dr. Hashmi in this case.

              22          Q.   And you agree that Dr. Hashmi,

              23  when you spoke to him, was on vacation?

              24          A.   I understand he was -- yeah.  I

              25  think he was on vacation, correct, yes.



                                                               126


               1          Q.   Do you know whether or not

               2  Dr. Hashmi accepted the patient, prior to his

               3  return from vacation?

               4          A.   So the best of my recollection is

               5  that he said, no problem, I'll call the

               6  hospital, we'll get him set up with the group,

               7  or the hospital room.  We'll get him admitted

               8  to the hospital.  He didn't say whose name

               9  would be on it, but we would get him admitted

              10  to the hospital at St. Vincent's.  We'll watch

              11  him over the weekend, and we'll do the surgery

              12  on Monday, assuming there is no problems over

              13  the weekend.

              14          Q.   Well, who was there to watch him,

              15  if he was going to be away all weekend, do you

              16  know?

              17          A.   His partners.

              18          Q.   And who was that?

              19          A.   Dr. Holland and Dr. Phillips, I

              20  believe.  And the -- and --

              21          Q.   So it was anticipated that they

              22  would be involved in watching this patient

              23  while Dr. Hashmi was away on vacation, just in

              24  case, you know, he needed to be treated before

              25  he returned?



                                                               127


               1             THE REPORTER:  Can you resay that?

               2  You kind of cut out, in and out on that one.

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  Sorry about that.

               4  Sorry about that.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You -- you

               6  anticipated that Dr. Hashmi's partners,

               7  Dr. Holland and Dr. Phillips, would be present

               8  at the hospital, while Dr. Hashmi was still on

               9  vacation.  That way, if anything occurred, and

              10  needed immediate treatment, there would be

              11  someone there, correct?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   Because if something happened

              14  with his condition prior to Monday that made

              15  it emergent, then someone else might need to

              16  do the procedure, correct?

              17          A.   That's correct.

              18          Q.   And but at least it was your

              19  judgment, at least when you sent the patient

              20  to Mercy-St. Vincent, that although he did

              21  need surgery, it could wait until Monday?

              22          A.   That's correct.

              23          Q.   And that was on what day,

              24  Saturday?

              25          A.   No.  I believe that was on



                                                               128


               1  Friday.

               2          Q.   Now --

               3          A.   In fact, I'm almost certain it

               4  was on Friday.

               5          Q.   And do you know when the patient

               6  was transferred, after you decided to have him

               7  transferred?  Was it shortly thereafter?

               8          A.   I believe it was Friday

               9  afternoon.

              10          Q.   And do you know how it was that

              11  either Dr. Phillips or Dr. Holland learned

              12  about the patient being transferred?

              13          A.   I really am not privy to that,

              14  how they found out.

              15          Q.   Do you know if it's permis -- do

              16  you know, and don't guess or speculate, but if

              17  you do know, please tell me, do you know if it

              18  was -- if it is permissible for a surgeon to

              19  accept a patient under their name when they're

              20  on vacation, admitted to the hospital?

              21          A.   So again, in attempts to best

              22  answer that question, I will tell you that

              23  every hospital I know of, including our

              24  hospital, you can admit a patient under your

              25  name, even if you're on vacation, as long as



                                                               129


               1  there's been a pre-setup arrangement with your

               2  partners to cover those patients.

               3             How St. Vincent's Hospital, or

               4  their CT surgery department is set up, I can't

               5  speculate, but I would absolutely not be

               6  surprised, or in fact I'd probably be -- I

               7  would be surprised if -- if that wasn't the

               8  case, that you could admit a patient where

               9  you're on vacation and your partners would --

              10  would cover.

              11          Q.   Well, just to be clear on this,

              12  you know of the procedure where if a person is

              13  unavailable, they can have their partners

              14  admit the patient, if they're not present,

              15  correct?

              16          A.   So again, if I understand your

              17  question, if there is a group of partners, and

              18  somebody is on vacation, but yet their patient

              19  needs to be admitted, the partners can admit

              20  them, yes.  I -- I think that is true.

              21          Q.   Under the partnership name, is

              22  what you think?

              23          A.   Say it again.

              24          Q.   Whose name do they admit the

              25  person under?



                                                               130


               1          A.   Oh, I have -- I -- I assume it

               2  was probably Dr. Hashmi, but I really don't

               3  know.  I'm sorry.

               4          Q.   Well, do you know if it's a

               5  medical -- do you know, and don't speculate or

               6  guess, do you know whether or not it was a

               7  medical staff violation for a doctor to accept

               8  the patient, when they were on vacation, in

               9  their name, as opposed to doing it through

              10  their partners, who were present at the

              11  hospital?

              12          A.   I'm not aware of that being a

              13  violation.

              14          Q.   You don't think it is?  You don't

              15  think that's a violation?

              16          A.   I am not aware of that being a

              17  violation.

              18          Q.   Do you know what -- well, you say

              19  not aware.  Do you think it is -- do you think

              20  it is or isn't?

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  Asked and answered --

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You don't

              23  know?

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  -- objection.

              25          A.   As I said before, the only thing



                                                               131


               1  I have to draw on this is from Mercy-Tiffin

               2  Hospital.  Do you want me to tell you the only

               3  experience I have to draw on?

               4          Q.   No.  I don't want to talk to you

               5  about Tiffin Hospital.  I want to talk to you

               6  about whether you know it's proper, improper,

               7  or don't know whether it's a violation of the

               8  medical staff --

               9          A.   As I said, I'm not aware that

              10  that is a violation.

              11          Q.   You said you're not aware.  But

              12  what you're saying is, you're not aware it is.

              13  Well, how do you know whether it isn't?

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              15  argumentative.

              16          A.   I don't know.

              17          Q.   You don't know --

              18          A.   I told you I don't know.

              19          Q.   But you would admit your father

              20  to a hospital when the doctor wasn't there,

              21  right?  You would do that, right?

              22          A.   As long as there were

              23  arrangements where he would be taken care of,

              24  absolutely.

              25          Q.   Well, did you make any



                                                               132


               1  arrangements with Dr. Holland or Phillips to

               2  make sure that they were act -- you called --

               3  strike that.

               4             You called Dr. Hashmi directly on

               5  his cellphone; is that right?

               6          A.   That's correct.

               7          Q.   Did you make any arrangements at

               8  all with Dr. Phillips or Dr. Holland to try to

               9  take care of this patient, or even tell them

              10  the patient was coming?

              11          A.   So with all patients, whether I'm

              12  calling Phillips, or Holland, or Hashmi, I

              13  make the phone call to the doctor.  If they

              14  think the patient can be done outpatient, we

              15  make the arrangement outpatient, not me, other

              16  people.  If they feel the case is urgent, or

              17  emergent, we make, the staff make arrangements

              18  to have the patients transferred to the -- the

              19  hospital, the receiving hospital.  That is all

              20  done by other staff than me.

              21             The only single thing I need to

              22  know is, number one, a receiving doctor, have

              23  you spoke to a doctor who has accepted this

              24  patient to take care of them.  If that has

              25  been done, and the patient agrees they want to



                                                               133


               1  go there, everything is done by other people

               2  than myself.

               3          Q.   Okay.  So -- fine, but I asked

               4  about you.  Did you -- do you do anything, you

               5  say staff and things, do you recall doing

               6  anything yourself to talk to either

               7  Dr. Phillips, or Dr. Holland, prior to

               8  transferring the patient to tell them that the

               9  patient was on the way?

              10          A.   I do not remember that.

              11          Q.   And do you recall asking any

              12  staff or anyone to do that for you?

              13          A.   So I ask the staff to do every

              14  arrangement that I've always done with every

              15  patient; call the transfer center, tell them

              16  that I've spoke with Dr. Hashmi, or whoever

              17  the doctor is, tell them they've accepted the

              18  patient and transfer it, give them the

              19  diagnosis for transfer.  And then who calls

              20  who, and what -- who is contacted is -- is all

              21  beyond me.  But it happens every day, really,

              22  when we do a transfer.

              23          Q.   Now, when the patient was

              24  transferred, do you know where Dr. Phillips

              25  was at the time that the patient was



                                                               134


               1  transferred to the hospital?

               2          A.   Did I know where he was at the

               3  time?

               4          Q.   Yes.

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Have you come to learn where he

               7  was at the time?  Or did you come to learn

               8  where he was?

               9          A.   Well, when I called him to try

              10  and stop this case from happening, he said he

              11  was either in between surgeries or going into

              12  a surgery.  So at some point, while he was

              13  there, he was either in between surgeries, or

              14  going into a surgery, but I don't know

              15  anything more than that.

              16          Q.   Okay.  So it would be consistent

              17  with your recollection then if it turned out

              18  that Phillips learned of the transfer when he

              19  was in the OR with another patient that he was

              20  operating on, would that be consistent?

              21          A.   I -- I would not contest that.

              22          Q.   And that Dr. Phillips was in

              23  another OR performing a remedial surgery on a

              24  prior patient of Dr. Hashmi's, would you know

              25  that?



                                                               135


               1          A.   I don't know anything of that.

               2          Q.   And do you know whether -- what

               3  happened to that patient, that patient of

               4  Dr. Hashmi's that needed to come back for

               5  another surgery, do you know what happened to

               6  that patient?

               7          A.   I have absolutely no --

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               9  foundation.

              10          A.   -- idea what you're talking

              11  about.

              12          Q.   And but you don't know how

              13  serious or not serious that surgery was that

              14  Dr. Phillips was in in the OR, or did you

              15  know?

              16          A.   I'm not sure how I can say it

              17  differently.  All I know was he said, I -- I'm

              18  either in between surgeries, or going into a

              19  surgery.  That is all I know.

              20          Q.   Sorry about that, Doctor.  You

              21  came back.  We lost you for a minute.

              22          A.   Yeah.  I actually saw that.  It

              23  did click out.

              24          Q.   I don't know if you answered or

              25  not.  If you did --



                                                               136


               1          A.   Okay.  I will try again.

               2          Q.   Sure.  Thank you.

               3          A.   All I know is that when I called

               4  Dr. Phillips, he was either in between cases,

               5  or going into a case, but I know nothing else

               6  about any kind of case he was doing, or any of

               7  the details.

               8          Q.   Okay.  Okay.  Now, at the time

               9  you called Phillips about trying to prevent

              10  the procedure from going forward, were you at

              11  the hospital?

              12          A.   I was at Mercy Health-Tiffin

              13  Hospital.

              14          Q.   All right.  So you weren't

              15  actually there to see the patient in

              16  Mercy-St. Vincent, the condition the patient

              17  was in?

              18          A.   I did not, again, from Tiffin

              19  Hospital, no.  I did call the nurse to ask his

              20  condition, his vitals, and what was going on.

              21  I also talked with the family about his

              22  condition.  I tried to talk to Dr. Holland,

              23  but he wouldn't take my call.  But no, I was

              24  not in person to evaluate him, only through

              25  the phone.



                                                               137


               1          Q.   Okay.  So in paragraph 5A of your

               2  affidavit, you say, after much persuasion, I

               3  convinced him to use Dr. Hashmi, because I

               4  hold him in the highest regard as a cardiac

               5  surgeon.

               6             I read that part correctly,

               7  correct?

               8          A.   Yes.

               9          Q.   Dr. Hashmi could not do the

              10  surgery until the Monday after his vacation.

              11  That was an acceptable time frame.

              12             I read that portion correctly,

              13  correct?

              14          A.   Yep.

              15          Q.   And that's basically what you

              16  testified to already today, right?

              17          A.   Correct.

              18          Q.   Now, the acceptable time frame

              19  was based upon what you saw in the patient on

              20  Friday, as opposed to what -- after his

              21  transfer, correct?

              22          A.   It was based both on what I saw

              23  beforehand, all the data that had been done,

              24  including the echo, and my conversations with

              25  the nurse and the patient family.  I would



                                                               138


               1  have liked to have additional information of

               2  Dr. Holland's, but he would not take my call,

               3  as I stated.

               4          Q.   The patient was admitted before

               5  that Monday to get prepared for the procedure.

               6  Dr. Holland was on call that day and told the

               7  family that the patient needed surgery

               8  immediately.

               9             Did I read that part correctly?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And that is true, Dr. Holland

              12  told the patient, the family, that the patient

              13  needed surgery immediately?

              14          A.   That is my understanding.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And are you also aware

              16  that Dr. Phillips told the family that the

              17  patient needed surgery immediately?

              18          A.   I have no direct knowledge of

              19  that.

              20          Q.   Well, you talked to Dr. Phillips,

              21  who told you that he believed the patient also

              22  -- he also believed the patient needed surgery

              23  immediately, correct?

              24          A.   That is absolutely not correct.

              25          Q.   He denied -- you deny that he



                                                               139


               1  said that?

               2          A.   When I called Dr. Phillips to

               3  say, please help me avoid this disaster that

               4  is going to happen, there is a patient, I told

               5  him the patient name, and said he's been

               6  transferred up there.  I do not want

               7  Dr. Holland to do the surgery.  This will be a

               8  big mistake.  And he said, hey, look, I'm in

               9  between cases, I'll see what I can do, but I

              10  don't know.  I'm kind of busy.  I mean, he

              11  said it in a nice way.  He wasn't a jerk, but

              12  I had to get the feeling he would do what he

              13  could, but that is the only interaction with

              14  Dr. Holland that day.  Doctor, I'm sorry,

              15  Dr. Phillips.  Sorry.  The only interaction

              16  with Dr. Phillips that day was when I called

              17  him to try and stop the case.  And he said,

              18  I'll do what I can.  He said nothing about

              19  whether the case should or should not be done.

              20          Q.   So you never heard from any

              21  source that when Dr. Phillips entered the room

              22  of the patient, and after reviewing the films,

              23  he stated, how is he alive?

              24          A.   I read that in -- sorry.

              25          Q.   You never heard that he said



                                                               140


               1  that?

               2          A.   I never heard that.  I read that

               3  in Dr. Holland's testimony.

               4          Q.   Were you made aware that there is

               5  an audio regarding with Dr. Phillips saying

               6  that, how is he alive?

               7          A.   I'm not aware of that.

               8          Q.   Well, I'll represent to you that

               9  there is.

              10          A.   Okay.

              11          Q.   Now, just to be clear then, if

              12  Dr. Phillips in fact did say that on an audio,

              13  how is he alive, or words to that effect,

              14  that's not the message he conveyed to you,

              15  though, right?

              16          A.   No, not at all.

              17          Q.   He conveyed the message that this

              18  guy was doing just dandy, and that he could

              19  wait until Hashmi came on Monday, right?

              20          A.   I told you what he conveyed to

              21  me.  He conveyed to me, I'll look into it.

              22  That's all he conveyed to me.  He didn't -- as

              23  far as I knew, I -- it was the first he was

              24  hearing from, when I called him.

              25          Q.   So you didn't hear from



                                                               141


               1  Dr. Phillips again after that, after he looked

               2  into it?

               3          A.   I absolutely do not remember any

               4  conversation with Dr. Phillips beyond what I

               5  just told you.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  The next

               7  sentence, This caused unnecessary drama and

               8  anxiety.

               9             Did I read that correctly?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And who did it cause anxiety for?

              12          A.   The patient, the patient's

              13  family, and yeah.  Let's go with that.

              14          Q.   And how do you know that?

              15          A.   When the son called me, very

              16  upset, saying what the heck is going on.  This

              17  is not what we agreed to.  Who the heck is

              18  this Holland guy?  We never agreed to this.  I

              19  took from that that they were upset.

              20          Q.   Now, if a person needs surgery

              21  immediately, is it proper for the surgeon to

              22  tell the patient that he needs to have surgery

              23  immediately, or should he lie and hide it and

              24  not tell him?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,



                                                               142


               1  argumentative.

               2          A.   I would think it would be

               3  appropriate, if a patient indeed needed

               4  emergent surgery, to tell them, that's

               5  correct.

               6          Q.   And when a person is told that

               7  they need emergent surgery, that, at least,

               8  usually causes at least some type of anxiety,

               9  doesn't it?

              10          A.   If they're told.  I would say

              11  when they're told inappropriately, it causes

              12  even more anxiety.

              13          Q.   When you say -- well, I'm just

              14  asking about when they're told that they need

              15  immediate surgery.  That normally causes a

              16  person to have anxiety, right?

              17          A.   I'm sure.

              18          Q.   Now, in terms of drama -- hang on

              19  one second.

              20             Now, do you know whether at the

              21  time Dr. Holland advised the family that the

              22  patient needed surgery immediately, that

              23  Dr. Phillips also agreed with him that that

              24  was the case?

              25          A.   I'm sorry.  Repeat the question.



                                                               143


               1          Q.   Do you know whether or not at the

               2  time Dr. Holland told the family that the

               3  patient needed immediate surgery, or emergent

               4  surgery, that Dr. Holland -- that Dr. Phillips

               5  agreed with him?

               6          A.   I'm not aware of that.  As I

               7  said, I only had that one interaction with

               8  Dr. Phillips.  He didn't say anything about

               9  the case, and Dr. Holland wouldn't take my

              10  phone call.

              11          Q.   Did you ever talk to Dr. Phillips

              12  after the case?

              13          A.   I honestly do not remember even a

              14  single time discussing this case, after that

              15  single interaction I already told you about.

              16          Q.   All right.  Next is, I repeatedly

              17  tried to contact Dr. Holland.  This is the

              18  next in your affidavit.  I repeatedly tried to

              19  contact Dr. Holland to stop him from the

              20  surgery.  He admit -- admittedly intentionally

              21  evaded my phone call, until after he performed

              22  the surgery.

              23             There is a couple of points here.

              24  Did I read that general correctly?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               144


               1          Q.   Now, the first part is you said

               2  you were repeatedly tried to contact

               3  Dr. Holland to stop him from the surgery.

               4  Correct?

               5          A.   That's correct.

               6          Q.   And you admit doing that?

               7          A.   Yes.  Well --

               8          Q.   And were there films made of this

               9  man when he was in the hospital, upon being

              10  presented to Mercy-St. Vincent?

              11          A.   Are you talking about a heart

              12  catheterization or an echocardiogram?

              13          Q.   Yes.

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   Okay.  And you -- did you

              16  personally read those?

              17          A.   Certainly the heart cath, I

              18  definitely did.  I cannot say for sure, on the

              19  echo.  My partner may or may not have read

              20  that one.  I don't know.  But it could have

              21  been me or my partner.  Those are probably the

              22  only two people that would have read the echo,

              23  though.  But I certainly reviewed the echo,

              24  even if I was not the signing doctor, doctor.

              25          Q.   Why was it you state here that



                                                               145


               1  you were repeatedly attempting to contact

               2  Dr. Holland to stop him from doing the

               3  surgery?

               4          A.   Well, because the family

               5  contacted me to try and stop the procedure.

               6  When I called the nursing staff to say what is

               7  going on, and they said, he's fine, there is

               8  nothing going on.  Well, tell me the vitals,

               9  and is he passed out, is he having rhythm

              10  problems?  No, he's fine.  It seemed clear to

              11  me, without further information from

              12  Dr. Holland, that we should stop this surgery,

              13  which again, had no indication that it needed

              14  to be done emergently.

              15             Now, if Dr. Holland would have

              16  taken my phone call, perhaps he would have

              17  explained something different to me, but he

              18  would not take my phone call.

              19          Q.   Do you know how long the right

              20  coronary artery had been blocked in this

              21  patient?

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   Now, do you know -- did you ever

              24  review the medical records of this patient

              25  after his surgery?



                                                               146


               1          A.   Certainly directly after his

               2  surgery, I was keeping track of his care up in

               3  the hospital.  And of course, I saw him for

               4  several months after the surgery, so yes, I

               5  have reviewed his medical records since then.

               6          Q.   So you reviewed the history and

               7  things of that nature that Dr. Holland and

               8  others had written down in the records?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   And after you -- after the

              11  surgery is performed, did you notice -- note

              12  anywhere that this patient had become

              13  lightheaded during preop evaluations?

              14          A.   I, again, just trying to be

              15  totally honest with -- with what I can

              16  remember.  I -- the best of my ability, I

              17  would not be surprised if somewhere

              18  Dr. Holland said the patient was lightheaded.

              19  That's all I can state.

              20          Q.   Do you know whether or not the

              21  patient had to be placed supine in bed?

              22          A.   No, I don't really remember that.

              23          Q.   Do you know whether or not

              24  placing a patient supine in bed is an ominous

              25  sign?



                                                               147


               1          A.   Well, it certainly can be

               2  ominous, but it's certainly not always

               3  ominous.  By -- by the way, doing it doesn't

               4  make it ominous.  If it needed to be done, and

               5  patient was deteriorating, then yes, that -- I

               6  would argue that could be an -- an ominous

               7  sign.

               8          Q.   Normally, you would defer to the

               9  surgeons that are in the hospital to review

              10  the condition of the patient, as opposed to

              11  you yourself inter -- intervening, correct?

              12          A.   If they called me and told me

              13  that what I believed, and what was agreed upon

              14  was no longer true, and were persuasive in

              15  their assessment of why it needed to be done

              16  differently, I would absolutely defer to the

              17  person there.  Without any knowledge, no, I

              18  can only go on the knowledge I have of the

              19  patient's care.

              20          Q.   Do you recall ever Dr. Phillips

              21  not repeatedly returning your calls, or you

              22  just didn't call him, after that one call?

              23          A.   I'm sorry, repeat the question

              24  again.

              25          Q.   After you had the one discussion



                                                               148


               1  with Dr. Phillips, where he said he would look

               2  into it --

               3          A.   Yep.

               4          Q.   -- do you recall him refusing to

               5  talk to you about the case?

               6          A.   No.  I had no reason to talk to

               7  him about the case.

               8          Q.   Did you call Doctor -- did you

               9  call Dr. Kabour with regard to this patient?

              10          A.   I did.

              11          Q.   Did you call him before or after

              12  you called Dr. Phillips?  To the best of your

              13  recollection.

              14          A.   I honestly do not know the answer

              15  to that.  They were all rapid succession.

              16  Three, four, maybe five calls.  I don't

              17  remember which order it was in.

              18          Q.   But according to what you're

              19  saying then, whether it was Phillips or

              20  Holland, or anyone else, no one gave you any

              21  indication whatsoever that this -- that this

              22  gentleman needed emergent heart surgery?

              23          A.   That is correct.

              24          Q.   You were surprised to learn that

              25  he had had one?



                                                               149


               1          A.   Surprised would be an

               2  understatement.

               3          Q.   Well, you called Dr. Kabour, and

               4  you requested that Dr. Kabour assist you in

               5  preventing Dr. Holland to perform the

               6  procedure, right?

               7          A.   That's correct.

               8          Q.   And you told him that if the

               9  gentleman did need a procedure, even then,

              10  that the patient should be transferred to the

              11  Cleveland Clinic?  You told Dr. Kabour that,

              12  didn't you?

              13          A.   I don't remember that at all.

              14          Q.   You don't recall telling

              15  Dr. Kabour you wanted to transfer the patient

              16  to the Cleveland Clinic, instead of having

              17  Holland do a procedure?

              18          A.   I'll do the best I can with what

              19  I remember saying.  The primary reason of him

              20  calling was saying, hey, Dr. Kabour, I know

              21  you're very busy, but I am very concerned

              22  about this patient who has been transferred up

              23  there.  The patient was very adamant that only

              24  Dr. Hashmi do the surgery, otherwise, they

              25  want to go to Cleveland Clinic.  Will you



                                                               150


               1  please help me in intervening?  I said, I've

               2  already called the, or I don't think I already

               3  did, but, again, I was trying to pursue other

               4  means to stop this surgery.  But if he could

               5  do anything to help prevent this from going

               6  forward, I'd really appreciate it.

               7          Q.   And do you have a generally good

               8  relationship, to the best of your knowledge,

               9  with Dr. Kabour?

              10          A.   I would say we have a relatively

              11  cordial working relationship.

              12          Q.   Did you also call Mr. Dempsey?

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   Or -- you did?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   And he was -- what was his

              17  position?

              18          A.   Seemed quite alarmed.

              19          Q.   Who was the -- no.  What was his

              20  position?

              21          A.   Oh, well, he's not a doctor.  He

              22  doesn't know.

              23          Q.   What was Dempsey's job title?

              24          A.   Say it again, I'm sorry.

              25          Q.   What was Mr. Dempsey's job title?



                                                               151


               1          A.   He was either interim CEO or CEO,

               2  I believe.

               3          Q.   So you called the CEO of the

               4  hospital about this case as well?

               5          A.   That's correct.

               6          Q.   Why did you call him?

               7          A.   I felt a patient was going to be

               8  harmed, probably irrevocably, and so I did

               9  whatever I could do to try and stop that from

              10  happening.

              11          Q.   What was the -- well, the --

              12  well, he was going to have surgery on Monday,

              13  but instead he was having it on Saturday?

              14          A.   With what I felt was a far

              15  inferior surgeon.

              16          Q.   And that was based upon the cases

              17  you referenced previously?

              18          A.   That's correct.

              19          Q.   And you had hadn't actually

              20  looked at any of Dr. Holland's statistics?

              21          A.   I think what I said was I had

              22  gotten all kinds of data from Dr. Phillips

              23  over the years, based on discussions with him,

              24  and cases, and patients coming back, so yes,

              25  that is all data that I have had on



                                                               152


               1  Dr. Holland prior to this time.

               2          Q.   And that's not -- that's not

               3  data, that's anecdotal evidence, sir.

               4          A.   No --

               5          Q.   Data is when you --

               6          A.   -- outcomes are data, whether the

               7  patient died or not, whether they got a right

               8  coronary artery or not, whether they had the

               9  surgery done, or even turned down the patient,

              10  all of it is absolutely data.

              11          Q.   Yeah, sure.  Sir, this data that

              12  you claim to have reviewed, it was not

              13  accumulated in any statistical format, it was

              14  just -- right?

              15          A.   I did not do any statistics, that

              16  is correct.

              17          Q.   And your conclusion was -- what

              18  type of procedure did this gentleman need?

              19          A.   He needed a multivessel bypass

              20  and an aortic valve surgery, replacement.

              21          Q.   So he needed nonemergent,

              22  according to what you knew on Friday, a

              23  nonemergent multivessel bypass with aortic

              24  valve replacement?

              25          A.   I'm 90 percent sure, but say that



                                                               153


               1  again, especially that last part, and I will

               2  confirm that, I believe.

               3          Q.   A multivessel bypass with aortic

               4  valve replacement?

               5          A.   Yes.  That is my understanding.

               6          Q.   And it was nonemergent, meaning

               7  it could wait until Monday, as opposed to

               8  being done Friday or Saturday?

               9          A.   Correct.

              10          Q.   And what part of this procedure,

              11  based upon your, what you stated is your

              12  knowledge of Dr. Holland's skills, what part

              13  of this procedure did you believe Dr. Holland

              14  was unable to perform correctly?

              15          A.   So again, based on that very

              16  similar case, in a 50-year-old, in which he

              17  said, gosh, this guy is too sick, and I don't

              18  think I can do it safely, was probably one of

              19  the first things that came to my mind.  If in

              20  a much sicker patient, arguably based on his

              21  age, and the fact that he was, I think more

              22  symptomatic, certainly with the passing out

              23  recently episodes, I felt very justified that

              24  this was not a case Dr. Holland I thought was

              25  -- I would have sent my own father to.  And



                                                               154


               1  furthermore, certainly not what I promised the

               2  patient or the family, when they agreed to be

               3  transferred to St. Vincent's in the first

               4  place.

               5          Q.   Did you advise this family that

               6  Dr. Hashmi, prior to transferring them to the

               7  hospital, was the only surgeon you knew of

               8  that could perform this procedure --

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   -- on him correctly?

              11          A.   No, I did not tell them that.

              12          Q.   What other -- what other

              13  surgeons, if any, did you advise the family

              14  that could perform this procedure, other than

              15  Dr. Hashmi, prior to transferring?

              16          A.   They asked me who they think

              17  should do the surgery.  I told them I thought

              18  Dr. Holland should do the surgery.  Sorry, I

              19  told them Dr. Hashmi should do the surgery.

              20  They did not ask for any other names.

              21          Q.   Okay.  The procedure that was

              22  ultimately performed here on RR was more

              23  complicated, was it not, than the one that was

              24  performed on the patient you referred to

              25  earlier from 2013, correct?



                                                               155


               1          A.   I think that could be

               2  questionable.  I think they were of similar

               3  complexity, I suppose.  There was a valve, and

               4  a -- and a multivessel bypass, so similar

               5  complexity.  Again, I don't know if you care

               6  about this, but I do believe the EF, the heart

               7  strength, on the first case was a little bit

               8  less.  In this case, his heart strength was

               9  normal.  But the fact that he was older, and

              10  you know, might -- so had similar complexity.

              11          Q.   Now, did Dr. Holland ever tell

              12  you, or Dr. Phillips, either of them ever tell

              13  you that they refused to do this procedure, or

              14  didn't think that this one should go forward?

              15          A.   On RR?

              16          Q.   Yes.

              17          A.   He wouldn't take my phone call.

              18          Q.   But you -- in your affidavit, you

              19  wrote that he wasn't taking your call, because

              20  he knew that you would want him to cancel the

              21  surgery, right?

              22          A.   So after --

              23          Q.   That's what you wrote.

              24          A.   I know.  That was after he called

              25  me after the surgery, I'm telling you what he



                                                               156


               1  said.

               2          Q.   Okay.  But you were trying to

               3  cancel the surgery, and he wasn't calling you

               4  back, right?

               5          A.   He wasn't taking my phone call

               6  from the nurse, he wasn't taking my phone call

               7  from the patient's family, and he wasn't

               8  taking the phone call on his own phone.

               9          Q.   And did Dr. Holland ever text

              10  you, call you, or email you and say that he

              11  didn't feel competent or capable of doing this

              12  procedure?

              13          A.   He gave no communication.  He

              14  refused to take my communication and gave me

              15  no communication.

              16          Q.   But in the instance of 2000 and

              17  whatever, that prior care that we talked

              18  about, in that instance, when Dr. Holland

              19  believed that he did not want to, or could

              20  not, for whatever reason, perform the

              21  procedure, he advised you of that, right?

              22          A.   That's correct.

              23          Q.   And you had indicated before, it

              24  wouldn't surprise you if for some reason here

              25  or there you would text message with



                                                               157


               1  Dr. Holland, correct?

               2          A.   Yes, that's correct.

               3          Q.   And so you don't recall ever

               4  seeing anything -- you got no feedback, that

               5  you're aware of, from either Dr. Holland or

               6  Phillips, that either one of them was telling

               7  you that they were incapable of doing the

               8  procedure, or they didn't think the procedure

               9  should be performed, correct?

              10          A.   I got no communication from

              11  Dr. Holland period.  And the information I got

              12  from Dr. Phillips, I've already shared with

              13  you.  That is the only communication I had

              14  from them.

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  I'll object to the

              16  form of the last question and asked and

              17  answered several times.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Do you know

              19  how much water had to be removed from the

              20  chest cavity outside the patient's lung during

              21  this procedure?

              22          A.   No, I do not.

              23          Q.   Do you know what plural effusion

              24  is?

              25          A.   I do.



                                                               158


               1          Q.   What is your understanding of

               2  what a plural effusion is?

               3          A.   Fluid around the lungs.

               4          Q.   All right.  Now, is it your -- if

               5  we go down to your affidavit, you note here

               6  that the family was very unsatisfied with the

               7  experience, as well as the physician who

               8  referred the patient to me to make the

               9  referral of the surgeon, correct?

              10          A.   Are you reading that verbatim?

              11          Q.   Yes.  The family was -- in

              12  paragraph 5A.

              13          A.   Okay.

              14          Q.   The family was very unsatisfied

              15  with the experience --

              16          A.   Yep, I see it.

              17          Q.   -- as well as the physician who

              18  referred the patient to me to make the

              19  referral of the surgeon.

              20             Did I read that correctly?

              21          A.   That's correct.

              22          Q.   And that's not true, is it?

              23          A.   No, that's quite true.

              24          Q.   You believe that's true?

              25          A.   That is true.



                                                               159


               1          Q.   Are you aware that recordings

               2  were made with regard to this patient, audio

               3  recordings?

               4          A.   Someone mentioned, or I saw in an

               5  affidavit or somewhere that there was a

               6  recording made.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Give me one second.

               8             Were you ever made aware that a

               9  quarter and a half of fluid outside the right

              10  lung was discovered?

              11          A.   I'm going to need to take a break

              12  to cancel patients.  I can answer this

              13  question, if you'd like, but I guess I'm going

              14  to need to take a break here, but I'm sorry,

              15  repeat the question.

              16          Q.   You know what, why don't you take

              17  the break now, do what you have to do, and

              18  then I'm going to be finishing up relatively

              19  soon, I think.  Mr. Wiencek may have some

              20  questions for you.  Let's just take your break

              21  real quick, let you do that, and I will zero

              22  in on what I have to finish up with you, okay?

              23             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason, do you have

              24  any idea your -- how much more time you think

              25  you'll need?



                                                               160


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  I -- 20 minutes

               2  maybe.

               3          A.   Okay.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  I'll need about a

               5  half an hour.

               6             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the

               7  record.

               8             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

               9  12:45 until 12:53.)

              10             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on

              11  record.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did the family

              13  of RR tell you that Dr. Holland was rude to

              14  them?

              15          A.   I don't remember that, that they

              16  did -- I do not believe -- I don't remember

              17  them saying that.  Sorry.

              18          Q.   Do you recall ever being told

              19  that one of the family members of RR said

              20  thank you to Dr. Holland immediately after

              21  performing the procedure?

              22          A.   I have no knowledge of that.

              23          Q.   Do you know whether or not the

              24  son of the patient told Dr. Holland and

              25  Dr. Phillips that they had made the right



                                                               161


               1  decision?

               2          A.   I am not aware of that.

               3          Q.   You weren't aware of that?

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to form and

               5  the characterization of the record.

               6          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Were you ever

               7  made aware that one of the family members told

               8  Dr. Holland that they appreciated everything

               9  that he had done?

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

              11          A.   I am not aware of that.  I can

              12  tell you all the interaction I know about the

              13  family, which I'm sure we'll get to, but no, I

              14  don't have any information about what was done

              15  at the hospital before I saw the patient in my

              16  office.

              17          Q.   Were you ever made aware that

              18  Dr. Holland said the following:  I will take

              19  care of him the way I will take care of all my

              20  patients.  We will be watching everything that

              21  goes on.  And one of the family members

              22  responded by saying, and all the nurses

              23  confirm that, they absolutely like you very

              24  much here and respect you, and they were --

              25  they said good things.



                                                               162


               1             Did you know about that?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Same objection.

               3          A.   I would again say I have no -- no

               4  knowledge of that.

               5          Q.   Do you know whether or not the

               6  nurses at St. Vincent liked and respected

               7  Dr. Holland?

               8          A.   Quite honestly, I do not have any

               9  inside knowledge of that either.

              10          Q.   Do you know whether or not

              11  Dr. Holland also gave the family his cellphone

              12  number and told them that they could call him

              13  if they had any questions?

              14          A.   I read that Dr. Holland had

              15  stated that in his deposition.

              16          Q.   Do you have any reason to think

              17  that that isn't true?

              18          A.   I have no knowledge that it's

              19  true or not true.

              20          Q.   Doctor, what indication did you

              21  have at all that the family was unsatisfied

              22  with Dr. Holland after the procedure?

              23          A.   Well, when the patient came back

              24  to me, probably a good, at least six to

              25  eight weeks after the surgery, which is quite



                                                               163


               1  unusual, they -- I said what is going on.  And

               2  they said, told me how awful the last six to

               3  eight weeks were, and how he was still very

               4  short of breath, and he kept continuing to

               5  gain weight, and Dr. Holland had done multiple

               6  procedures to try and draw fluid off.  They

               7  said, this is not what we expected at all, and

               8  he's not getting any better.  That was my

               9  first indication that they were unhappy with

              10  how things went.

              11             The next thing is when they said,

              12  should we sue Dr. Holland, was the next

              13  indication that they may have had their doubts

              14  about Dr. Holland.

              15          Q.   And so you documented that in

              16  your records, right?  You wrote down that this

              17  family wanted to, asked you if they could --

              18  should sue Dr. Holland?

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form.

              20          A.   Yeah.  I don't believe that was

              21  written down, but I generally keep my records

              22  to pertinent patient care, you know,

              23  discussions, and I don't write about their

              24  brother and sister, or those kind of things,

              25  so no, I don't believe that I put that in the



                                                               164


               1  record.

               2          Q.   Well, this isn't talking about

               3  writing down about brothers and sisters.  This

               4  is talking about them threatening or

               5  considering suing Dr. Holland.  That sounds

               6  pretty serious.

               7          A.   Yeah.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form.

               9          A.   To be totally honest, the reason,

              10  in fact, I had multiple reasons why I didn't

              11  put it in the chart, but probably the biggest

              12  one is out of respect for Dr. Holland.  If

              13  they would have said, I'm going to sue, you

              14  know, Dr. Holland, and -- I may have put

              15  something like that into it, but just to ask

              16  me whether they should sue Dr. Holland, I

              17  thought would be needlessly, potentially

              18  damaging to Dr. Holland, if any other person

              19  would read that chart.

              20          Q.   Did you document anything in the

              21  records of any complaints the family had about

              22  any care Dr. Holland, or anyone else

              23  performed?

              24          A.   Outside of his very delayed

              25  recovery, which took about three months,



                                                               165


               1  instead of about three weeks, and the repeated

               2  visits over and over again, which I think

               3  would be documentation of the poor outcome, I

               4  did not mention derogatory messages about

               5  Dr. Holland directly.  And I -- that's kind of

               6  what I told the patient too.  And if you want

               7  to know what I said, I'll tell you, but you

               8  didn't ask, so I won't.  But I will say that

               9  one of the things I said was, look, right now,

              10  we have got RR in front of us here.  He's

              11  suffering.  It's not what he expected.  It's

              12  not what either of us expected.  Let me focus

              13  on trying to get him better.  I will do

              14  whatever you want.  I will help you for as far

              15  as you want to go.  But right now, my main

              16  concern is trying to get RR breathing better

              17  and recovering from the surgery.

              18          Q.   And what you just said about all

              19  this RR stuff is just not true, right?

              20  Because you sent Dr. Holland a text on or

              21  about June 28, 2017, in which you told him

              22  that you had seen Mr. R today, and although he

              23  is still trying to pretend he's not improving,

              24  he's down 10 pounds over the last week.  And

              25  his wife says he is definitely getting better.



                                                               166


               1  I think we will keep with the aggressive

               2  outpatient management and see what happens.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

               4  narrative, argumentative.

               5          A.   Okay.  So I think we need to back

               6  up here.  So when was that text that you're

               7  referring to?

               8          Q.   June 28, 2017, approximately --

               9          A.   June --

              10          Q.   -- one month after he left the

              11  hospital.

              12          A.   -- 28th, a month later.

              13          Q.   Yes.

              14          A.   Okay.  So what was your question?

              15  Actually, why don't you repeat the text first,

              16  and then --

              17          Q.   Well, he was down 10 pounds as of

              18  one month later, and you told Dr. Holland that

              19  you thought he was improving, right?

              20          A.   If you have a text, feel free to

              21  read it to me.  I honestly don't really

              22  remember that text enough to comment on it

              23  much.

              24          Q.   No.  Okay.

              25             FYI, I saw -- this is the text.



                                                               167


               1  FYI, I saw Dr. R -- I saw Mr. R today.

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  Strike the name,

               3  please, from the record, if you don't mind,

               4  just to protect.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) FYI, I saw

               6  Mr. R today, and although he is still trying

               7  to pretend he's not improving, he is down 10

               8  pounds over the last week, and his wife says

               9  he is definitely getting better.  I think we

              10  will keep up with the aggressive outpatient

              11  management and see what happens.

              12             Do you recall --

              13          A.   So I could respond to that --

              14          Q.   -- sending a text like that to

              15  Dr. Holland?

              16             THE REPORTER:  Wait, wait, wait,

              17  guys.

              18          A.   Sorry, my fault.

              19          Q.   Do you recall sending that text

              20  to Dr. Holland?

              21          A.   Could you give me context?  Is

              22  that the first of a list?  Is that the middle

              23  of a text?  Is there a text before that?

              24          Q.   It's the entire text you sent to

              25  him on that day.



                                                               168


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Jason, has that text

               2  been produced?

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  No, but we will.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Huh.  Move to strike

               5  any -- anything related to this.  This is

               6  ridiculous.  Absolutely.  You know, you're all

               7  tactical, Jason.  You're all tactical.  That's

               8  incredible to me that you wouldn't have given

               9  that to us first.  That's incredible to me.

              10  Unbelievable.

              11             MR. ARCHINACO:  First of all, it's

              12  impeachment evidence, so you're wrong.  You

              13  don't even know the law.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  No.  No.

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Tom, you make these

              16  statements designed to intimidate witnesses

              17  every time they --

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  No, I don't.  You're

              19  the one who intimidates witnesses.

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  Don't interrupt me

              21  anymore.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  No.  I'm not

              23  interrupting you.

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  (Unintelligible.)

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  And I'm tired of your



                                                               169


               1  --

               2             THE REPORTER:  Wait, guys.

               3             MR. WIENCEK:  I'm tired of your

               4  tactical nonsense here.

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  You're -- sir, you

               6  don't know the rules of law --

               7             MR. WIENCEK:  Yeah.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- and you do this

               9  every time.  You yell and you raise your voice

              10  --

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  I'm not yelling at

              12  you.  I'm being direct with you, and you don't

              13  like people who are direct with you.

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  You raise your

              15  voice with witnesses on purpose, because you

              16  try to intimidate them.

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  No.

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Your conduct with

              19  Adam Carruthers was unbelievable.  I mean, and

              20  you do it every deposition, when you don't

              21  like what is going on.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  No.

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  This is impeachment

              24  evidence.  I have no obligation to provide it

              25  to him at all --



                                                               170


               1             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason, we --

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  -- or you, but I

               3  will anyway, because I've already impeached

               4  him.  He already got fried on it.

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  No.

               6             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason --

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Then you can make

               8  your argument to the Judge.  You can cite

               9  whatever cases you think are appropriate.

              10  We'll do it with the Court, not in a

              11  deposition.

              12             MR. BRAZEAU:  Jason, we need to be

              13  out of here by 1:30, so I, you know, you can

              14  carry on your debate, but if you've got more

              15  questions for this witness, so that he can get

              16  on with his practice, I would appreciate it.

              17             MR. ARCHINACO:  We agree with you,

              18  sir.  We'll move on with the question.  I

              19  completely agree with you.

              20             MR. BRAZEAU:  Thank you.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, in terms

              22  of the recovery of the patient after

              23  approximately three months, he was recovered;

              24  is that correct?

              25          A.   That is my rough recollection,



                                                               171


               1  correct, yes.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And do you recall if --

               3  strike that.

               4             You do recall that there were times

               5  when fluid still had to be removed

               6  post-surgery from this patient, correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   And that Dr. Holland had seen the

               9  patient and done that, correct?

              10          A.   That is my understanding.

              11          Q.   Finally, I wanted to ask you

              12  about your declaration 5D, paragraph 5D.

              13          A.   Yep.

              14          Q.   5D, you indicated that several of

              15  your patient -- well, let me just read it.

              16  "Several of my patients complained that

              17  Dr. Holland was rude to them."

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   Now, you had mentioned patients

              20  you had remembered today, and I didn't hear

              21  any of the patients, or at least I didn't hear

              22  anything in any of those conversations today

              23  that indicated Dr. Holland was rude.  But if

              24  those were the patients you were talking

              25  about, please advise.  If there is other



                                                               172


               1  patients that you're talking about here,

               2  please tell me what you're talking about.

               3          A.   So the only one that we talked

               4  about today that I think would easily be

               5  considered rude was the patient, the first

               6  patient, that I remember referring to him,

               7  where he called him on the morning of the

               8  surgery to tell him he was cancelling it.

               9  When the patient called, and they were very

              10  upset, they felt it was rude that he would

              11  cancel the patient, have his office staff

              12  cancel the patient the morning of the surgery.

              13  And so that would be an example of certainly a

              14  rude way a patient was treated.

              15             The other ones, I cannot think of

              16  specific examples, just the general feeling

              17  that when they came back, that -- not all of

              18  them, by any means -- but some of them were

              19  unhappy with his, the way they treated him, or

              20  them.

              21          Q.   So do you remember of anyone

              22  else?  I mean, that patient he actually did

              23  not see.  Can you think of any patient he

              24  actually saw --

              25          A.   No.  No.  He saw that patient.



                                                               173


               1          Q.   Well, okay.  So he did see the

               2  patient, and -- and you said that he made a

               3  phone call, or had his staff cancel the

               4  procedure?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   But Dr. Holland saw the patient

               7  and told the patient why, correct?

               8          A.   The -- he told the patient we

               9  were going to do the surgery in two weeks, and

              10  then did not do it.

              11          Q.   Dr. Holland saw him the day of

              12  the surgery as well, or no?

              13          A.   No, I don't believe he saw him --

              14  honestly, I don't know that for sure, but I --

              15          Q.   Okay.

              16          A.   -- it's not my understanding that

              17  he saw him the day of surgery.

              18          Q.   Any other patients that you can

              19  specifically remember complaining about him

              20  being rude to them?

              21          A.   Not specific examples, I'm sorry.

              22          Q.   And any other patients, other

              23  than what you have mentioned today, where a

              24  patient complained about any outcome that they

              25  had?



                                                               174


               1          A.   Not that I can remember.

               2          Q.   Any -- anything other than you've

               3  mentioned today, that you can think of, where

               4  a person felt that they were being dismissed

               5  by Dr. Holland, a patient?

               6          A.   I'm sorry, what do you mean by

               7  dismissed?

               8          Q.   Dismissive.

               9          A.   Oh, dismissive.

              10          Q.   Do you recall ever him being --

              11  anything other than what you have mentioned

              12  today, any other patients you can think of

              13  where Dr. Holland was told to have been

              14  dismissive of their concerns about --

              15          A.   No, I -- not that I can think of.

              16          Q.   Any patients that you can --

              17  strike that.

              18             In your -- the next sentence in

              19  your affidavit, or the last sentence in 5D, it

              20  says, Dr. Holland tends to have a "know it

              21  all" attitude.

              22             Is that based upon what you've

              23  already testified to today, or is there

              24  anything else that you think you need to add?

              25          A.   No.  I think that would be



                                                               175


               1  included in certainly the RR case mostly, but

               2  in other cases as well, but no, everything I

               3  said already.

               4          Q.   Now, in terms of RR case, what --

               5  what about the procedure, if anything, did

               6  Dr. Holland perform that should not have been

               7  performed?

               8          A.   I, as I told him, was upset that

               9  he had not bypassed the right coronary artery,

              10  so he had closed him up before that was done,

              11  but other than that, the valve was replaced.

              12          Q.   So then after three months, even

              13  though Dr. Holland did not bypass the right

              14  coronary artery, the patient wound up doing

              15  pretty well, is your recollection, correct?

              16          A.   No, that's not correct at all.

              17          Q.   It's not?  I thought you said the

              18  patient RR did well?

              19          A.   Was doing better.  I never did

              20  answer that question, but I think I'll tiptoe

              21  into that, and again, without -- I prefer to

              22  have seen the text, but in referring to that

              23  one context text, which I don't think for a

              24  second is the first text that I gave back to

              25  him before that.  But nonetheless, if about a



                                                               176


               1  month afterwards, he was doing better, it was

               2  only because I had already seen the patient,

               3  rearranged his care completely, and -- and

               4  although, I want to be as respectful of

               5  Dr. Holland as possible.  He's not a

               6  cardiologist, and he was trying to get this

               7  patient through the surgery, after the

               8  surgery, I'm sorry, and he had no idea what he

               9  was doing.  Again, I actually -- I feel bad

              10  about saying that, but I'll just say that when

              11  people after surgery do well, they do well

              12  with the cooperation of the cardiothoracic

              13  surgeon and the cardiologist.

              14             When he purposely, according to the

              15  patient, told them not to come to me, and that

              16  he could take care of it, it continued to

              17  deteriorate his condition, to as bad as it

              18  was, until I finally saw him.  After just a

              19  week of me getting involved, he absolutely was

              20  doing better.  That ultimately took at least

              21  another month and a half to two months, before

              22  he was recovered from the heart failure.  And

              23  to be honest, he ended up getting an infection

              24  of that valve, and I believe is probably dead

              25  to this day.



                                                               177


               1             So no, I don't think I would

               2  characterize it as he did great, but he did do

               3  better, after I was brought back into the

               4  case.

               5          Q.   So you believe that he got an

               6  infection in that valve at a subsequent point

               7  in time?

               8          A.   Well, the Cleveland Clinic thinks

               9  that he got an infection in that valve shortly

              10  afterwards.  Because when he came back to the

              11  hospital with an infection, there was no

              12  talking at this time.  He wanted to go to

              13  Cleveland Clinic.  I said, I -- I failed you

              14  to a certain degree in following through on my

              15  commitment to you, so I understand your

              16  concern.  Family was right there.  There was

              17  nothing I was going to do anyway.  They were

              18  100 percent adamant, so the patient was

              19  transferred to Cleveland Clinic.

              20          Q.   In any of these times, where you

              21  indicate the family was complaining to you

              22  about Dr. Holland, did they ever mention to

              23  you that approximately six months after the

              24  surgery, they invited him to dinner with them?

              25          A.   No.  They certainly never



                                                               178


               1  mentioned that.

               2          Q.   So that seemed to be inconsistent

               3  with supposably what they were saying, where

               4  they were unhappy with him?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               6  argumentative, form.

               7          A.   So what we were talking about was

               8  not Dr. Holland.  We were talking about their

               9  husband and father, about his deteriorating

              10  condition, so we did not talk about

              11  Dr. Holland or having dinner.  We talked about

              12  what we were going to do to try and get their

              13  loved one over this pretty serious

              14  complication.

              15          Q.   No, but you had indicated, at

              16  least I thought I heard words to the effect,

              17  that this family was unhappy with Dr. Holland

              18  post-surgery, right?

              19          A.   What I said was that they were

              20  very dismayed by the prolonged course, that

              21  they did not expect.  And number two, they

              22  asked me if they should sue him, because they

              23  were unhappy with how the case had gone, and

              24  -- and his delayed recovery.

              25          Q.   Okay.



                                                               179


               1          A.   So that's what I told you was my

               2  indication that they were perhaps not pleased

               3  with Dr. Holland's care.

               4          Q.   Okay.  So to be clear then, it

               5  would at least sound, based upon your

               6  conversations that you say you had with this

               7  family, it would seem inconsistent, given the

               8  fact that they were talking about suing

               9  Dr. Holland, that they would actually invite

              10  him to dinner six months later?

              11             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form.

              12          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) That seems --

              13  that would seem inconsistent, based upon your

              14  observation of his family, right?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Form and

              16  argumentative.

              17          A.   I have no opinion on what they're

              18  thinking, or why they're thinking it, or what

              19  their attitude is.  For all I know, they want

              20  to have lunch with, dinner with him, to, I

              21  don't know, try and get more information to

              22  sue him.  I haven't got a clue why they want

              23  to have dinner with him, if indeed that's

              24  true.

              25          Q.   What did -- do you know what the



                                                               180


               1  Cleveland Clinic did with the infected valve?

               2          A.   Repeat the question.

               3          Q.   What the Cleveland Clinic did

               4  with the infected valve?

               5          A.   Repeat the question.

               6          Q.   Do you know what the Cleveland

               7  Clinic did with what they thought or stated

               8  was the infected valve?

               9          A.   So again, I'll do the best I can.

              10  Probably four or five months, roughly, three

              11  to six months certainly, I believe anyway,

              12  when he came back to the hospital, clearly

              13  infected, or septic, is the medical term, with

              14  positive blood cultures.  There was little to

              15  no doubt that that valve was the source of the

              16  infection.  He was sent to Cleveland Clinic,

              17  where they discussed replacing the valve, but

              18  he had deteriorated so much, that they really

              19  felt that that would be more dangerous than

              20  good.

              21             So the last I heard, he was getting

              22  -- actually, a little bit more I know.  He

              23  came back to Mercy-Tiffin Hospital, like, I

              24  don't know, three, four weeks after that, on

              25  IV antibiotics.  He had already been on IV



                                                               181


               1  antibiotics for two or three weeks, and then

               2  we again transferred him back to Cleveland

               3  Clinic, because he was failing the more

               4  conservative IV antibiotic route in response

               5  to the infected valve.

               6          Q.   And is that the last recollection

               7  you have of the patient?

               8          A.   That's correct.

               9          Q.   And it -- antibiotics typically

              10  clear an infected valve; is that right?

              11          A.   Typically, would be -- definitely

              12  would not use that word.  It sometimes can.

              13          Q.   That's usually what's used first,

              14  correct?

              15          A.   It depends how infected it is,

              16  how good a surgical candidate the person is.

              17  Certainly, if they're infected, and they're a

              18  good surgical candidate, in good shape, then

              19  sometimes they would do it right away.  When

              20  the patients are more in rough shape,

              21  sometimes they know that the risk of death

              22  will be too high, and so they'll do

              23  antibiotics instead.

              24          Q.   And that is -- that was diagnosed

              25  by the Cleveland Clinic and not you?



                                                               182


               1          A.   It was diagnosed by me in the

               2  emergency room, and then confirmed by the

               3  Cleveland Clinic.

               4          Q.   How many months was that after

               5  the procedure?

               6          A.   Like I said, I do the best I can,

               7  but I would say certainly between two and

               8  six months, I believe, but probably more like

               9  three or four months.  I apologize I don't

              10  have a more solid answer.

              11          Q.   Okay.  That's all I have.  Thank

              12  you.

              13                     EXAMINATION

              14  BY MR. WIENCEK:

              15          Q.   I'll follow up with one question

              16  on the affidavit.  It's Plaintiff's Exhibit

              17  122.  In paragraph A, in the middle of the

              18  paragraph A, it says, I repeatedly tried to

              19  contact Dr. Holland to stop him from the

              20  surgery, and he admittedly, intentionally

              21  evaded my phone call until after he had

              22  performed the surgery.

              23             Did I read that correctly?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Did he actually admit to you that



                                                               183


               1  he was avoiding your phone calls?

               2          A.   When he finally called me,

               3  probably between 11 or 11:15 that night, and

               4  said that he did the surgery, I let him speak

               5  about what happened and how it went, and then

               6  I said, I'm -- I'll be honest, I'm quite upset

               7  that you wouldn't take my phone call.  This

               8  guy, in my opinion, did not need to have

               9  urgent or emergent surgery, or emergent

              10  surgery.  To which he kind of cut me off and

              11  said, see, this is exactly why I didn't take

              12  your phone call, because I knew you would

              13  argue with me and tell me why you didn't think

              14  it needed to be done, and -- and that was the

              15  end of the productive conversation.  There was

              16  a little bit of arguing back and forth, but

              17  that was mostly the rest of the conversation.

              18          Q.   Now, do you -- did you have every

              19  opportunity to edit and update this affidavit

              20  that is in Plaintiff's Exhibit 122?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Is there anything in this

              23  affidavit that you believe is incorrect?

              24          A.   Absolutely not.

              25          Q.   Is there anything in the



                                                               184


               1  affidavit that you object to?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Did anyone direct you as to what

               4  to put into this affidavit?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   And now that you been examined

               7  about your affidavit, is there anything you

               8  would recant from this affidavit?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   Now, during your experiences

              11  referring patients to Mercy-St. Vincent, did

              12  you ever see or hear of anything that would

              13  lead you to believe that patient referrals for

              14  surgery at Mercy-St. Vincent, or even

              15  Mercy-St. Anne, were done based on a surgeon's

              16  race or national origin?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   When you were using the surgical

              19  office to direct patient referrals, did you

              20  hear or see anything that would lead you to

              21  believe that any person was directing, or

              22  redirecting, patient referrals based on the

              23  surgeon's race or national origin?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   I have no further questions.



                                                               185


               1                    REEXAMINATION

               2  BY MR. ARCHINACO:

               3          Q.   Doctor, a couple -- and I'll let

               4  you get out of here soon, I promise you, so

               5  you can see your patients.

               6             You were just asked some questions

               7  about race and national origin, so I have some

               8  follow-up questions for you on that.

               9             First, what is your understanding

              10  as to what race is?

              11          A.   That's a good question.  My

              12  understanding would be basically, I guess,

              13  country of origin, I think.  There is

              14  Caucasian and I guess a rough -- I can name

              15  races, but basically it's a characterization

              16  of people, mostly based on their -- their

              17  color or region of -- of being from.

              18          Q.   Okay.  So you don't, to your

              19  knowledge, again, you're a physician, but

              20  you're not trying -- you're not a lawyer.  To

              21  you, there is not really a distinction between

              22  race and national origin?

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

              24  mischaracterization.

              25          A.   I'm sure there is a difference.



                                                               186


               1  If you'd like to ask me a question about the

               2  difference, I would be happy to try and answer

               3  the best I can.

               4          Q.   Well, do you know if there is a

               5  difference or not?

               6          A.   Between race and national origin?

               7  So I guess what I would say, the best I can

               8  do, is say that probably Asian people is a

               9  race from China, and you know, Japan, but

              10  national origin is Japan or China, so I

              11  suppose that would be my best deciphering of

              12  the difference.

              13          Q.   Okay.  And just to be clear,

              14  nobody from Mercy-St. Vincent or

              15  Mercy-St. Anne, any physicians, or anything,

              16  ever talked to you about race or national

              17  origin issues, correct?

              18          A.   Never that I can ever recall.

              19          Q.   And you don't recall anyone

              20  talking to you in particular, or saying to you

              21  in particular, anything along the lines, that

              22  there is a pattern that has developed in

              23  St. Vincent or St. Anne's with regard to

              24  referrals, correct?

              25          A.   I'm not aware of any pattern



                                                               187


               1  discussions.

               2          Q.   Right.  And you don't -- and you

               3  were not personal friends with Dr. Holland,

               4  correct?

               5          A.   I would not consider him a

               6  friend, I don't think.

               7          Q.   Couple last questions.  In terms

               8  of Dr. Hashmi, what type of relationship, if

               9  any, did you have with him outside of just

              10  referral, professional?

              11          A.   Only relationship really

              12  professional, but it was a very good, cordial

              13  relationship.

              14          Q.   Did he ever invite you to any

              15  private events or parties?

              16          A.   Not that I remember at all.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Doctor, thank you for your

              18  time today.

              19          A.   Thanks.

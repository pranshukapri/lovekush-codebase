          10    BY MS. FRARE:

          11         Q.    All right.  Good morning, Mr. Jones.

          12         A.    Good morning.

          13         Q.    My name is Suzanne Frare and I represent

          14    Charles Shaffer in this lawsuit brought by you

          15    regarding an accident that happened March 13, 2018 and

          16    I'm going to ask you some questions related to that.

          17         A.    Yes.

          18         Q.    Have you ever testified before in a

          19    deposition?

          20         A.    No.

          21         Q.    Okay.  So there's just a few ground rules.

          22    As you can see, there is a reporter in the room that

          23    is going to take down what is said, so as much as

          24    possible we need to avoid speaking at the same time.

          25    Even if you know what my question is going to be, let

                                                                      6



           1    me finish my question before you begin your answer and

           2    I will try to do the same thing.

           3               Please answer verbally as you have been.

           4    If you just nod your head or shrug your shoulders the

           5    reporter can't take down your response.  Okay?

           6         A.    All right.

           7         Q.    If I ask you something that you don't

           8    understand, just let me know.

           9               Also, if for some reason you need to take a

          10    break, just let me know that.  As long as there is no

          11    pending question that shouldn't be a problem.

          12         A.    Okay.

          13         Q.    What's your date of birth?

          14         A.    July 17, 1969.

          15         Q.    And can you tell me your Social Security

          16    number and, for the record, we'll just put the last

          17    four digits, but if you can tell me the whole thing.

           6         Q.    And can you tell me their names and ages?

           8    Elizabeth just turned 20 last week and Schaller is

           9    turning 17 tomorrow.

          10         Q.    Happy birthday.

          20         A.    We have been separated for over two years.

          21    This place here I just moved into four months ago.

          22         Q.    And where were you before that?

          23         A.    I'm at -- my mailing address or where she

          12         A.    East Hampton, Connecticut.

          13         Q.    And when were you in the Air Force?

          15    I reenlisted when I became salary at Pratt & Whitney

          16    in 2001.  And I got activated at 9/11, so I did

                                                                      9



           1         A.    I was a crew chief, an aircraft mechanic.

           2         Q.    And did you basically have that role --

           3         A.    Yes, the entire time.  Yes.

           4         Q.    -- the entire time?  Okay.

           5               And can you tell me generally what a crew

           6    chief does?

           7         A.    He maintains the entire airplane, basically

           8    all hydraulic systems, engines, airframe.  That's how

           9    I started my career.  I have my A&P license for

          10    aviation.

          11         Q.    And who do you work for now?

          12         A.    Right now my primary job is Pratt & Whitney

          13    United Technologies.

          14         Q.    And what do you do there?

          15         A.    Right now I'm the AWW operations manager

          16    for assembly and test, which is Alternate Work Week,

          17    Friday, Saturday, SUnday.

          18         Q.    I'm sorry.  Say that again?

          19         A.    It stands for Alternate Work Week which is

          20    the Friday, Saturday, Sunday shift.

          21         Q.    Okay.  Is that a full-time position?

          22         A.    Yes.

          23         Q.    So how many hours?

          24         A.    You work 12 hours, 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

          25    or 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.  I work the 6A to 6P, the

                                                                     10



           1    first shift.

           2         Q.    6 a.m.?

           3         A.    You work 36 hours and get paid for 40.

           4         Q.    And how long have you been doing that?

           5         A.    That position itself or how long have I

           6    been at Pratt?

           7         Q.    This is the current position that you have?

           8         A.    That's the current position.  I have been

           9    doing that about two years.

          10         Q.    And what were you doing prior to that?

          11         A.    My entire Pratt & Whitney career or --

          12    I can tell you what I started off as.

          13         Q.    Tell me the general history, yeah.  I don't

          14    want to spend too much time.

          15         A.    I started off as engine mechanic and then

          16    from there I traveled for Pratt and got offered a job

          17    to run the engine test facility in Middletown back in

          18    2000.  So then I became a supervisor there and then

          19    worked my way up through the ranks, supervisor, cell

          20    leader.  And then I troubleshot jet engines for Pratt

          21    for six years from their global operations center.  It

          22    kind of looks like NASA.  Everybody calls in and tells

          23    us their problems and we try to help them out over the

          24    phone.

          25         Q.    Okay.

                                                                     11



           1         A.    And then, from there, they offered me the

           2    position to run the Alternate Work Week, or Test and

           3    Assembly, based on my previous experience of running

           4    tests.  So I have been in this position for going on

           5    two years.

           6         Q.    For about two years?

           7         A.    Yes.

           8         Q.    At the time of this accident you were

           9    working in that position?

          10         A.    I was working there, yes.

          11         Q.    Can you tell me when you started with Pratt

          12    & Whitney?

          13         A.    I started with Pratt & Whitney in 1998.

          14         Q.    Now you said you also have another job?

          15         A.    For Northeast Auto and Truck.

          16         Q.    Northeast Auto and Truck.  Is that the name

          17    of the company?

          18         A.    Yes.

          19         Q.    What do you do for them?

          20         A.    I'm their tow truck driver.

          21         Q.    And how long have you been employed there?

          22         A.    I have been employed there I believe since

          23    2009.

          24         Q.    And how often do you work?

          25         A.    I work -- I used to work nights and

                                                                     12



           1    weekends when I didn't work the Alternate Work Week

           2    shift.  I was their on-call recovery wreck driver.

           3    Whenever accidents happen they call me in.  I work off

           4    a commission.

           5         Q.    So are you salaried or hourly or something

           6    else for them?

           7         A.    Well, again, it's commission.

           8         Q.    Commission?

           9         A.    Whatever the end of the final bill is

          10    I make a percentage of that.

          11         Q.    How often would you say you work for them?

          12         A.    How often?

          13         Q.    Yes.

          14         A.    Well, for right now, because I'm on the

          15    Alternate Work Week shift, I actually work for them

          16    Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  I'm on call 24/7.

          17         Q.    So for those three days you're on call

          18    24/7?

          19         A.    Yes.

          20         Q.    What would you say in an average week over

          21    the last two years?

          22         A.    I probably go out about anything from four

          23    to 14 times.  It's a cyclical business.  It gets very

          24    busy.  You're either wide open or it's slow.  But we

          25    tow for insurance companies and do other things.  At a

                                                                     13



           1    minimum I go out four or five times a week.  But if

           2    it's on a night or a day like that was, that was the

           3    first wreck of the day, but normally that would have

           4    been a very long day for me.

           5         Q.    Is that because there was a snowstorm?

           6         A.    Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  Like I said,

           7    it depends.  It's probably the only business you like

           8    it when it rains or you like it when it snows.

           9         Q.    A lot of work, right?

          10         A.    Yes.

          11         Q.    So probably the most you go out is about 14

          12    times?

          13         A.    Yes.  And it depends.  It's such a -- it

          14    all depends how people want to drive.  Some days for

          15    no reason at all you're very busy and days where it's

          16    snowing out and you'd think you'd be very busy you get

          17    one or two calls.  It all depends how everyone is

          18    driving.

          19         Q.    Can you say on average how many hours a

          20    week you work?

          21         A.    Again, it depends on where the tow is to.

          22    It depends on it could be a local tow.  Could be --

          23    there are times when I have to go all the way to

          24    Pennsylvania, Maine, if people are breaking down that

          25    live in that state sometimes the insurance companies

                                                                     14



           1    pay me to tow them all the way home.

           2         Q.    Is that often that you have to do a long

           3    distance tow?

           4         A.    No.  It's a couple of times a year.

           5         Q.    And so is it fair to say at Pratt & Whitney

           6    you're working about 36 hours a week?

           7         A.    Yes.

           8         Q.    And then as the tow truck, what do you

           9    work?

          10         A.    I would say probably -- if it's -- we

          11    average it out to where I'm doing six to eight calls a

          12    week.  I try to do probably 10 to 12 hours.

          13         Q.    10 to 12 hours a week?

          14         A.    Yes.

          15         Q.    That's kind of an average week?

          16         A.    Yes.

          17         Q.    Did you miss any time from work on either

          18    of these jobs?

          19         A.    Well, again, when it happened I had the

          20    luxury of not having to go to Pratt for a couple of

          21    days, so I took a couple of days off from the accident

          22    because they put me on muscle relaxers and I didn't

          23    feel right driving the truck.

          24         Q.    Other than a couple of days taking off?

          25         A.    No, I can't afford to take time off.

                                                                     15



           1    I have a lot of things going on.

           2         Q.    So you buckled up and you were able to get

           3    into work?

           4         A.    Yes, yes.

           5         Q.    Did you make a workers' comp claim?

           6         A.    No.  Again, it's a very small company,

           7    mom-and-pop operation.  I didn't want to put that

           8    burden on them.

           9         Q.    So there was no claim made?

          10         A.    The only claim that was made I believe was

          11    the original emergency room visit.  After that

          12    everything else was through my regular insurance.

          13         Q.    Okay.  All right.  Just to finish up here,

          14    at Pratt & Whitney is that a physical job that you

          15    have?

          16         A.    I haven't had to physically work since 2000

          17    when I went salary because it's a union shop.  I can't

          18    physically do anything other than direct people on

          19    what to do.

          20         Q.    My husband works for Pratt & Whitney.

          21         A.    Okay.

          22         Q.    So can you tell me generally what you do in

          23    this position?  Is it a desk job?

          24         A.    Yes, a desk job.  A lot of running the

          25    entire facility.  There's a lot of, you know, a lot of

                                                                     16



           1    walking.  There's a lot of overhead work which is why,

           2    you know, I've got to have this thing eventually

           3    fixed.  Most jet engines, they're not at level,

           4    they're just too big or they're up in the test

           5    facility so I'm constantly looking up.

           6         Q.    Are you reaching or --

           7         A.    No, no.  But everything that we're doing is

           8    overhead work.  And that's why this pain bothers me.

           9    By the end of the day all the stuff I'm doing, it's

          10    just a burning sensation that just won't go away.

          11         Q.    And as a tow truck operator, can you tell

          12    me about the physical aspect of that?

          13         A.    It's basically like on -- a thing like this

          14    it's mechanical work and it's a lot of -- especially

          15    accidents.  Accidents is what I like doing because you

          16    have to figure out how to get the car back up the bank

          17    or back off its roof.  Sometimes it's challenging, but

          18    for the most part it's not accidents.  A lot of it is

          19    just breakdowns and stuff, so it's easy work.  But

          20    it's -- it does have its physical times when, again,

          21    the car is down the bank.  You have to manipulate

          22    everything, figure out how to get it up and all this

          23    other stuff.

          24         Q.    And get it on the wrecker?

          25         A.    Yeah.  And as far as strenuous, you try to

                                                                     17



           1    make the wrecker do the work for you.  A lot of

           2    winching, cables, pulleys.  You don't kill yourself

           3    when you have the equipment to do it.

           4         Q.    Do you always drive the same vehicle?

           5         A.    No, no.  There's three different vehicles.

           6    There's this one, which was my main vehicle because

           7    it's the newest vehicle and he doesn't really trust a

           8    lot of other people driving it.

           9         Q.    And this vehicle, just so we're clear, what

          10    kind of vehicle is it?

          11         A.    That's a 2006 Nissan UD.  It's a cab

          12    forward.

          13         Q.    And it's like a flatbed truck?

          14         A.    Yes.

          15         Q.    And how often would you say that you drive

          16    that particular one?

          17         A.    That's the main one.  I drive that all the

          18    time unless someone else is on call and they call me

          19    for backup I will drive the other wreckers.  Sometimes

          20    it's a multiple vehicle accident.  Sometimes it's an

          21    accident way down the bank where you need to use the

          22    boom truck.  Since I know what I'm doing, they'll call

          23    me out with the boom truck to recover it back up to

          24    the street to get it on the flatbed for the guy that's

          25    working that day.

                                                                     18



           1         Q.    You said there were two other vehicles?

           2         A.    Yeah, there's two other wreckers.  One of

           3    them is a four-wheel-drive forward and the other one

           4    is a 99 International Flatbed like this one, but it's

           5    not a -- the UD is the primary one we use because it's

           6    got an excellent turning radius if you get into

           7    dealership parking lots it's much easier to maneuver

           8    around.

           9         Q.    Even though it's such a big vehicle?

          10         A.    Even though it's such a big vehicle because

          11    it's a cab forward that's the one you want to be in.

          12         Q.    All right.  So let's, at this point, turn

          13    to the accident.

          14         A.    Yes.

          15         Q.    March 13, 2018, is that the date?

          16         A.    Yes.

          17         Q.    Do you remember what day of the week it

          18    was?

          19         A.    No, no.  I don't remember what day of the

          20    week.  I can tell you it had to be most likely a

          21    Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.

          22         Q.    Because those are the days you work?

          23         A.    Right.

          24         Q.    And about what time did the accident take

          25    place?

                                                                     19



           1         A.    This was the first one of the day so it

           2    would have been early in the morning, probably right

           3    during rush hour, I would say, between 8:00 and 9:00

           4    or 10:00.

           5         Q.    In the morning?

           6         A.    Yes.

           7         Q.    And where did the accident happen?

           8         A.    This would have been Route 2 eastbound Exit

           9    13.

          10         Q.    And in what town?

          11         A.    Marlborough.

          12         Q.    And the weather conditions you told me, it

          13    was snowing?

          14         A.    Yes.

          15         Q.    Was it a big snowstorm?

          16         A.    It was your average.  For me that's an

          17    average snowstorm.

          18         Q.    Was it snowing at the time of the accident?

          19         A.    Yes.

          20         Q.    Ice and snow on the roadway?

          21         A.    Uh-hum.

          22         Q.    Was the roadway closed at all?

          23         A.    It was closed when this happened.

          24         Q.    Because of this?

          25         A.    Because of this.  Between the wrecker and

                                                                     20



           1    the car went across all the lanes, so they closed the

           2    road.  It was -- there was an officer in front of the

           3    UD which you can't see.  There's like a Suburban type

           4    of vehicle there, all-wheel-drive.  And then behind

           5    the wrecker scene -- I don't know if any of these

           6    pictures show it.

           7         Q.    Just for the record, we previously marked

           8    four photos that were provided by you; is that right?

           9         A.    Right.  So this was the -- prior to this

          10    happening -- I'm sorry -- this vehicle was in front of

          11    me.  When the accident happened, he went around to

          12    block traffic there.  But prior to the turn, you can

          13    see the lights where they stopped the traffic.  There

          14    were two other officers behind me about a hundred

          15    yards apart to slow traffic down and make sure people

          16    are moving to the right-hand lane.

          17         Q.    So just so I'm clear, when this accident

          18    occurred you were already at the accident scene?

          19         A.    Yes.  So without the car being there, this

          20    is where the truck was positioned, maybe a little

          21    further back because it got pushed forward, and this

          22    trooper was in front of me helping the people with the

          23    car.

          24         Q.    So let's start with, what were you

          25    responding to before this accident happened?

                                                                     21



           1         A.    This would have been the scene right there.

           2    I was on the side.  After I evaluated --

           3         Q.    This is Exhibit 1.

           4         A.    Yes.  After I evaluated where the car was

           5    versus the -- there's like rope rails right here --

           6    determined that I had to pull it up through the side.

           7    So that's when I was reaching -- I was inside the cab

           8    reaching behind the front seats.  We have to keep what

           9    is called loop straps in the cab because if they get

          10    wet they freeze up and you can't use them at all.  So

          11    I was reaching behind the cab to get the loop straps

          12    to put to the side of the tires and do a side pull to

          13    pull the car up.

          14         Q.    So there was a car off the road?

          15         A.    Yes.  That's it right there.

          16         Q.    What kind of car?  It's hard to see.

          17         A.    I would have to look that up.  I do this so

          18    often.

          19         Q.    It was a car as opposed to an SUV?

          20         A.    Yes, it was a car.

          21         Q.    And the van was to the left side of the

          22    road?

          23         A.    Yes, this is the left-hand lane.

          24         Q.    And I see, is this area where the yellow

          25    line is, is that the shoulder of the road?

                                                                     22



           1         A.    Yes.

           2         Q.    So you had responded to remove that?

           3         A.    And I couldn't pull right up on the car

           4    because, again, the trooper was there making sure that

           5    the people in the car were okay.

           6         Q.    Okay.  And how long had you been at the

           7    accident scene before the accident happened?

           8         A.    Probably five minutes.

           9         Q.    And in those five minutes you had actually

          10    gotten out of your vehicle?

          11         A.    Uh-hum.

          12         Q.    And when the accident occurred with my

          13    client's vehicle, you said you were reaching in?

          14         A.    Yes.  I was reaching in the cab over the

          15    seats because behind the seats is where we keep all

          16    the equipment that can't get wet.

          17         Q.    So you're reaching in on the passenger

          18    side?

          19         A.    Yes.  I'm reaching over into the passenger

          20    side behind the seats here.  There's three things of

          21    what we call straps.  There's all different kinds

          22    depending what you're going to do and that's where the

          23    loop straps were.  I was reaching over this seat here

          24    behind the other one.

          25         Q.    Were your feet on the ground?

                                                                     23



           1         A.    My feet would have been on the first step.

           2    So the door was open and my feet were on the step and

           3    I'm receiving over to grab the loop straps.

           4         Q.    And just as detailed as you can, were both

           5    feet -- you know, the position of your body, like both

           6    feet on the step?

           7         A.    Yes.  More than likely both feet were on

           8    the step there as I'm reaching behind the front seat.

           9         Q.    Okay.  Did you anticipate the accident

          10    before it happened?

          11         A.    No, no.

          12         Q.    Why don't you describe to me what happened.

          13         A.    Okay.  So I'm reaching behind the front

          14    seat to grab the loop straps.  All of a sudden, I got

          15    lunged into -- again, because it's a cab forward so

          16    the windshield is straight and then there's the dash.

          17    I got lunged forward into the windshield and then

          18    I ended up down between the seats and the dash.  And

          19    as soon as that happened I thought the worst.

          20    I thought somehow the truck rolled forward because the

          21    brake system is there and I'm like, "Oh my God."  I

          22    was freaking out.  "What just happened?"  Because,

          23    again, the last thing I saw was the officer and the

          24    two people in front of me so I thought the truck

          25    rolled forward.  I thought the worse, "Oh my God."

                                                                     24



           1         Q.    You thought your truck had moved?

           2         A.    Yes.  When that happened, again, my

           3    adrenaline is flowing.  I'm "Holy cow."  I jumped out,

           4    ran to the front of the truck, and I'm going "What?"

           5    And then I realized the officer is still in front of

           6    me far enough away.  I'm, "What's going on?"  And the

           7    officer screams, "I think someone ran into the back of

           8    your vehicle," and I came around and saw it.

           9         Q.    So you didn't even realize what had

          10    happened?

          11         A.    I didn't even realize what had happened

          12    because, again, I was so concentrated on -- I thought

          13    I ran into the people in the truck in front of me.

          14         Q.    And you jumped in front of the truck?

          15         A.    Yes.  I jumped out and ran in front of the

          16    truck.  And again, when I saw the officer there

          17    everybody is looking at me, "What just happened?"  And

          18    I'm looking at them, "What the heck just happened?"

          19    Because now, again, once I saw there were --

          20    everything was where it was supposed to be I'm like,

          21    "Okay, what is going on?"  And the cop is, "I think

          22    someone ran into behind you."

          23         Q.    And the cop was there and the people from

          24    the original accident?

          25         A.    Yes.

                                                                     25



           1         Q.    Were they all standing outside?

           2         A.    They were all -- I believe to the -- when

           3    I saw them they were all on the side of the car still,

           4    out of the vehicle though, when it was snowing.  And

           5    again, it's a good thing he was still there getting

           6    information on what happened in the accident because

           7    otherwise I'm usually telling them to get into the cab

           8    of the truck for their safety because they don't want

           9    to be off the side of the road.

          10         Q.    So nobody else was in the truck?

          11         A.    Nobody else.  It was me leaning across the

          12    front seat getting the loop straps.

          13         Q.    Did they see the car running into the

          14    truck?

          15         A.    No, because they were off to the side here,

          16    but the officer must have put two and two together and

          17    said, "Somebody must have slammed into the back of

          18    your truck," and then we both walked around.

          19         Q.    And your truck, when this happened, your

          20    truck was in the position as is shown in Exhibit 1

          21    here?

          22         A.    Yes.  I think it got pushed forward.

          23         Q.    So we're looking at Exhibit 3, just for the

          24    record?

          25         A.    Yes.

                                                                     26



           1         Q.    I see.  So the tire marks are in the snow?

           2         A.    That's where his car hit, but it got pushed

           3    forward, too, because it was snowing at the time, so

           4    that was from him when we removed the car from

           5    underneath it because eventually, like I said, they

           6    closed the whole highway down and that's the first

           7    time I ever spoke to the individual.  I said, "Hey,

           8    does your car still start?"  And he said yes and

           9    I said, "All right.  Let's see if it will back out

          10    from underneath to get traffic flowing again," and he

          11    did that and parked behind the wrecker.

          12         Q.    These photographs, did you take them?

          13         A.    Yes.  The officer asked me to take them.

          14         Q.    Okay.  And Exhibit 1 here and Exhibit 2,

          15    was this -- the vehicles weren't moved after the

          16    accident?

          17         A.    No, no.  That's prior to moving them, but

          18    once he moved out I took pictures of the controls and

          19    how he hit the rear of this to push the mudflap right

          20    up on top of the ....

          21         Q.    And so Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 4 is after the

          22    car was moved?

          23         A.    Yes.

          24         Q.    All right.

          25         A.    And I took this one just to show my boss

                                                                     27



           1    because I wasn't sure I would be able to do anything

           2    at that point because the controls, I wasn't sure if

           3    they would work.

           4         Q.    What did this control?

           5         A.    This controls the bed of the truck and the

           6    winch.

           7         Q.    And just for the record, Exhibit 4, we're

           8    looking at the controls here?

           9         A.    Yes.

          10         Q.    And so the two that are bent --

          11         A.    They're not supposed to be bent.  This

          12    whole thing got pushed up and we had to redo the whole

          13    control mechanism surface there.

          14         Q.    Was it able to work after the accident?

          15         A.    I worked it from the other side.  These

          16    were -- we disconnected these and -- there's controls

          17    on both sides.

          18         Q.    They're the same controls?

          19         A.    Yes.  They look exactly the same but

          20    they're not messed up.

          21         Q.    Okay.  I see.  And Exhibit 3 is just a

          22    further away picture?

          23         A.    Yes.

          24         Q.    And you said from Exhibit 3 you believe

          25    that the truck -- your vehicle actually moved from the

                                                                     28



           1    impact?

           2         A.    Yes, because he hit the controls and then

           3    hit the rear end.

           4         Q.    The tire?

           5         A.    So, and that's, when he did that, that's

           6    what threw me forward because we didn't know it at the

           7    time but later, like four months later, we had to

           8    replace all the brake parts on that side because when

           9    the emergency brake was on, this has air brakes, so

          10    when the emergency brake was set this side controls,

          11    and like I said we didn't know it at the time but they

          12    all broke off.  When I was using my emergency brake,

          13    it was only that side that was catching but we

          14    wouldn't have known that unless -- we finally figured

          15    it out because we were on a hill one time and all of a

          16    sudden it was rolling forward and that's when we

          17    figured out it had to be from when he hit the....

          18         Q.    Just to be clear, at the time you were

          19    stopped, before the accident, you had the emergency

          20    brake on?

          21         A.    Yes.

          22         Q.    And then from the impact of the accident,

          23    there was a problem with the emergency brake?

          24         A.    And again, we didn't know it at the time.

          25    None of that went through the insurance company or

                                                                     29



           1    anything, we just fixed it.  We were like that's from

           2    the accident because the other side was fine.

           3         Q.    And obviously the control panel that you

           4    were telling me about had to be replaced and that was

           5    damaged in the accident?

           6         A.    Yes.

           7         Q.    Was there any other part of the truck

           8    damaged in the accident?

           9         A.    No.  Again, he's kind of lucky.  The car

          10    went underneath the bed.  So when he pulled out it

          11    settled back down, but it's up a little bit here

          12    because his hood is underneath it.

          13         Q.    Was there damage to the underneath part of

          14    the truck?

          15         A.    No, because, again, the only thing in the

          16    way are the controls.

          17         Q.    That's good because the truck stopped the

          18    car from going underneath?

          19         A.    Yes.  Again, there's so much more scenarios

          20    that could have been worse.  I could have been at the

          21    controls.  The bed could have been down.  He would

          22    have went over the top of me.

          23         Q.    And the people in the car, you can go on

          24    and on?

          25         A.    Yes.

                                                                     30



           1         Q.    All right.  Do you know the names of the

           2    people?

           3         A.    No, no.

           4         Q.    What about the officer, is he the one that

           5    filled out the police report?

           6         A.    I don't know the officers' names.  There

           7    were three or four of them.  Like I said, there was

           8    him and then there were two more officers behind us

           9    but I don't know if there were multiple officers in

          10    the car, so I don't know who made the report out.

          11         Q.    Okay.  And as far as you know no one saw

          12    the car slide in, it was after?

          13         A.    Yes.

          14         Q.    Okay.

          15         A.    Because, again, traffic was flowing, but we

          16    were flowing in one lane on the other side.

          17         Q.    And the officers had blocked which lane?

          18         A.    They blocked the left lane behind me

          19    probably a good four hundred yards behind us.

          20         Q.    All right.

          21         A.    And again, there was one there and one even

          22    further back with his lights on to get people to slow

          23    down first.  And then the other one was moving people

          24    over to get by this scene because, again, the right

          25    lane was open.  There was no reason to close the

                                                                     31



           1    highway down.  And they typically don't.  They never,

           2    unless it's blocking more than one lane they won't

           3    close the highway.

           4         Q.    Okay.  So I know you were telling me what

           5    happened to your body when this happened.  You hit the

           6    windshield, you said?

           7         A.    Yes.

           8         Q.    What part of your body hit the windshield?

           9         A.    The back of my head.  I was reaching over

          10    the seat and it threw me this way and the windshield

          11    is right there.

          12         Q.    Did it crack the windshield?

          13         A.    No.

          14         Q.    And can you tell me, again, what other

          15    parts of your body hit what inside the vehicle?

          16         A.    Again, I got tossed around so it was --

          17         Q.    I know it's a very difficult question.

          18         A.    I can tell you I ended up on the floor in

          19    between the seats and the dash and that is a very

          20    tight area.  So I was this way, so I had to, you

          21    know -- and again, I was so jacked up from adrenaline

          22    thinking I might have ran over somebody in front of

          23    me, but....

          24         Q.    In the front seat is it like a bench seat

          25    or two?

                                                                     32



           1         A.    There's two.  The seat that I drive in, the

           2    driver's seat, is an air ride seat because it's a big

           3    truck so when I ride in the seat when you're going

           4    over bumps it cushions the impact.  And then there's

           5    the middle has an arm rest which flips up to another

           6    seat and then there's a passenger seat which is the

           7    same as mine but it's not an air ride seat.

           8         Q.    And so you were reaching over the passenger

           9    seat at the time?

          10         A.    Yes.  I was reaching up.  That middle

          11    section is a raincoat coat that's on a hangar.

          12         Q.    Is there a back seat to the cab?

          13         A.    No.  It's just -- behind the cab, it's an

          14    extra cab, but that is for tool storage.

          15         Q.    And that's where you were reaching?

          16         A.    That's what I was reaching behind to get

          17    the straps.

          18         Q.    Okay.  And your head hit the actual

          19    windshield, right?

          20         A.    Yes.

          21         Q.    And you ended up your whole body on the

          22    floor?

          23         A.    My whole body between the seats and the

          24    dashboard.

          25         Q.    Was your head where the driver's seat was?

                                                                     33



           1         A.    It was in the middle, I assume, only

           2    because I was reaching over.

           3         Q.    Did you have any visible injury?

           4         A.    My shoulder was a little bit black and

           5    blue.

           6         Q.    That's your left shoulder?

           7         A.    Yes.

           8         Q.    And where was the bruising to your

           9    shoulder?

          10         A.    It was up here.  (Indicating)

          11         Q.    The top?

          12         A.    Yes, the top.

          13         Q.    Any photos of that?

          14         A.    No.  It wasn't -- again, it didn't really

          15    go black and blue for a day or so.  That wasn't their

          16    main concern at the emergency room.

          17         Q.    I understand.  I was just asking the

          18    details.

          19               Okay.  So your head hit the windshield and

          20    your body ended up on the floor?

          21         A.    Yes.

          22         Q.    Any other part of your body hitting

          23    anything else that you can recall?

          24         A.    Not that I can recall.

          25         Q.    Afterward you were able to get out

                                                                     34



           1    immediately?

           2         A.    Oh, yes.  I ran to the front.  I didn't

           3    even look in the back.  If I looked in the back

           4    I would have noticed what happened, but I ran toward

           5    the front of the vehicle because I wanted to make sure

           6    everybody was all right.

           7         Q.    Okay.

           8         A.    Because, again, I thought it was something

           9    I did.  I didn't assume somebody slammed into the back

          10    of the truck.

          11         Q.    Did you hear the impact or anything?

          12         A.    No.  Well, all the impact I heard was like

          13    inside the cab.  Yes, I heard it but I thought it was

          14    me hitting someone in front of me.

          15         Q.    Oh, okay.  And did you feel the impact?

          16         A.    Again, my adrenaline -- so, again, if it

          17    was just a normal thing where I didn't think I might

          18    have done, you know, something in front of me,

          19    I probably would have said yes, I felt it then.  But

          20    I was so fired up on what the heck, trying to figure

          21    out what happened.

          22         Q.    All right.  So right after you went over to

          23    the officer?

          24         A.    Yes.

          25         Q.    And to the occupants of the other vehicle?

                                                                     35



           1         A.    Yes.

           2         Q.    Can you describe the occupants of the other

           3    vehicle?

           4         A.    Yeah.  It was a middle-age couple.

           5         Q.    Did you go over to the red car?

           6         A.    This one?

           7         Q.    Yes.

           8         A.    After.  When the officer said that, "Hey,

           9    I think someone slammed in behind you," and so I'm

          10    back there and so the officer went over and he started

          11    to talk to the guy, but I was looking at the car and

          12    what happened and I was like, "Oh, God."

          13         Q.    Okay.  Now, I know your adrenaline and

          14    everything, but immediately after the accident were

          15    you feeling any pain or aware of any injuries?

          16         A.    Again, they asked me, the officers asked me

          17    if I wanted, you know, I said, I know, "I'm banged up,

          18    but no one else is on duty."  My boss was in the other

          19    truck at the other end of the highway.  I said, "I'm

          20    good," because they said, "We'll call an ambulance."

          21    They kept asking me, "I will call an ambulance."

          22    I said, "I'm good.  If I leave the truck there nothing

          23    will get done.  The highway will stay closed.  I will

          24    go afterwards.  Don't worry.  I will figure out what's

          25    going on."

                                                                     36



           1         Q.    So there was no one to replace you with the

           2    tow truck?

           3         A.    No, because if my boss is in the other

           4    truck there is no one to come grab this one.  Even

           5    when he showed up, we would have had to leave one

           6    truck there.

           7         Q.    But can you tell me what you were feeling

           8    at the time right after this happened, the best you

           9    can?

          10         A.    Yeah, just, you know, breathing hard.

          11         Q.    But --

          12         A.    I mean, at that time, I'm a tough guy.

          13    Even if I was hurting I would have sucked it up.

          14         Q.    I'm just trying to get an idea of what you

          15    were feeling right when this happened.  I mean, right

          16    after this happened.

          17         A.    Right after it happened?  I'm just like

          18    that explains everything that happened in the cab, you

          19    know.

          20         Q.    I mean, were you feeling pain to any

          21    particular part of your body?

          22         A.    Well, yeah.  Again, I was bruised up but it

          23    wasn't anything that I was going to stop, you know.

          24         Q.    I understand you were able to keep going

          25    but with some difficulty?

                                                                     37



           1         A.    Right, yes.

           2         Q.    But can you tell me, I know you had

           3    bruising to your shoulder.  Was there any other

           4    bruising to any other part of your body after the

           5    accident?

           6         A.    No, everything was just burning.  But

           7    again, I have had -- I've pulled my leg, that type of

           8    burning, so you figure it's going to stop.

           9         Q.    All right.  And where was the burning, to

          10    what part of your body?

          11         A.    It was on my upper neck.

          12         Q.    In the back, right?

          13         A.    Yes.

          14         Q.    Okay.  Any other part of your body?

          15         A.    No.

          16         Q.    Were you able to continue to tow the

          17    original vehicle?

          18         A.    I stayed there until my boss showed up and

          19    my boss did the majority of the work.  I just drove

          20    the vehicle back.

          21         Q.    What's your boss's name?

          22         A.    Danny Cafro; C-A-F-R-O.

          23         Q.    And what about the red car?  Did you tow

          24    that?

          25         A.    That one got towed with the other truck

                                                                     38



           1    that he brought out.

           2         Q.    That Danny brought out?

           3         A.    Yes.

           4         Q.    Did you ever speak to the driver of the red

           5    car?

           6         A.    Yeah.  Like I said, after we realized the

           7    highway was closed, because it was two lanes, that's

           8    when I went over.  And the first thing I asked him was

           9    if he was all right.  He said yeah and I said, "Does

          10    your car start?"  He said yes, so I said, "If the car

          11    starts we're going to get this one out of the way so

          12    they can reopen the highway."  And the officer that

          13    was there said it was perfect, so that's what we did.

          14    We had him start it up, put it in reverse, and slowly

          15    back out.  Then he drove around and put the car behind

          16    the truck.

          17         Q.    And then they were able to open the

          18    roadway, right?

          19         A.    Yes.

          20         Q.    So what did you do after the accident?

          21         A.    After the accident, again, I just -- Danny

          22    did all the work.  You know, he got the car up.  He

          23    pulled the truck forward, got the car up, and then he

          24    loaded it up on the bed and then he loaded this car on

          25    his truck and I drove back to the shop.  There's a

                                                                     39



           1    turn-around up the street a little ways, so maybe

           2    I went a mile up the street, did the turn-around to

           3    get into the westbound lane for the emergency vehicles

           4    and got back.  And once I got back I said, "All right.

           5    I'm going to head up to the emergency room to have

           6    them look at this."  He said, "That's fine," that he

           7    would take care of all the rest and unloaded the

           8    vehicles and did all of that.

           9         Q.    So you brought the tow truck back to your

          10    office?

          11         A.    Yes, the business.

          12         Q.    And where's that?

          13         A.    That's at 394 North Main Street in

          14    Marlborough.

          15         Q.    And how far was that from the accident?

          16         A.    From that point right there I can tell you

          17    it's exactly two miles.

          18         Q.    And were you involved in unloading either

          19    of the vehicles?

          20         A.    No.  I just brought the vehicle through the

          21    gate, got out, and -- I'm trying to think.  Oh, yeah.

          22    Danny handed me -- I said, "I'm going to the emergency

          23    room," and he handed me their workmen's comp number,

          24    I guess it was, and he said, "Just give them that."

          25         Q.    For the emergency room?

                                                                     40



           1         A.    Yes.

           2         Q.    And did you drive yourself to the emergency

           3    room?

           4         A.    Yes.

           5         Q.    Anyone go with you?

           6         A.    No.

           7         Q.    And what emergency room did you go to?

           8         A.    That was the Marlborough.  They changed the

           9    name on it so many times but it's the Middlesex

          10    Hospital Clinic.  It's a 24-hour.  That's where

          11    everybody goes that gets into an accident.

          12         Q.    Is that right near --

          13         A.    It's right off the exit where our shop is

          14    at, so it's literally a mile, two miles up the street.

          15    Probably a mile because it's two miles from here.

          16         Q.    All right.  And when you got there were you

          17    seen right away?

          18         A.    Yes.

          19         Q.    And what were your -- was it still the same

          20    complaints, the burning to the neck?

          21         A.    Yes.  I told the doctor when I went in, the

          22    first thing they did is they took my blood pressure

          23    and immediately put me in a neck brace.  When I got

          24    into the -- what do you call it, the room there that

          25    they put you in, I had the neck brace on and it

                                                                     41



           1    actually hurt more.  That's when I told the doctor,

           2    "You've got this neck brace on me now.  It's

           3    absolutely killing me."  He said, "It's procedure.  We

           4    have to do it that way."  And that's when they took me

           5    from there in the back to have whatever they do at the

           6    hospital.

           7         Q.    CT scan?

           8         A.    Yes.  I think that's what it is.

           9         Q.    Any other type of testing did they do?

          10         A.    Yeah.  They did whatever they do when you

          11    go in there.  At this point I'm like, "Get this off

          12    me."  I said, "You're absolutely killing me having

          13    this on my neck.  It hurts like crazy."  He said, "We

          14    can't until we figure out what's going on."

          15         Q.    So they took the CT scan?

          16         A.    Yes.

          17         Q.    And did they take you anywhere else for

          18    testing or x-rays?

          19         A.    No.  Everything they did was in the room

          20    there.

          21         Q.    Okay.  And what did they do?

          22         A.    Physically he was looking with his hands

          23    and stuff.  And again, it just was excruciating pain.

          24    Again, I don't understand why they -- I understand

          25    they've got procedures, but having that neck brace on

                                                                     42



           1    really, really made things worse.

           2         Q.    How long did you have to have it on for?

           3         A.    Probably -- I guess I was there for a

           4    couple of hours.

           5         Q.    Did they give you any medication?

           6         A.    Yes.  They gave me some muscle relaxers.

           7         Q.    Do you remember the names?

           8         A.    I think it's in the medical report.

           9         Q.    I have the report.

          10         A.    It's like a different language.

          11         Q.    And how long did you take the muscle

          12    relaxers?

          13         A.    I took them for two days.  They made my

          14    stomach so upset I stopped taking them.  That's why

          15    I saw my normal doctor to see if there was anything

          16    else because my stomach was a disaster with what they

          17    gave me.

          18         Q.    Did they give you any other pain

          19    medication?

          20         A.    They told me to take the high dose

          21    ibuprofen.

          22         Q.    Over-the-counter?

          23         A.    Yes.  They said take up to 800 or a

          24    thousand.  I forget what they said.

          25         Q.    Did you do that?

                                                                     43



           1         A.    Yes.  And I have been doing that,

           2    unfortunately, for the past -- since this happened.

           3         Q.    Now, at the time within 24 hours of the

           4    accident, had you had any type of medication?

           5         A.    No.

           6         Q.    Any type of medication that you were

           7    supposed to take that you failed to take?

           8         A.    No.

           9         Q.    Any alcohol?

          10         A.    No, I don't.  I'm DOT tested here and at

          11    Pratt & Whitney so it's not something....

          12         Q.    All right.  Did they give you a neck brace

          13    to take home from the hospital?

          14         A.    No.  At that point after they did their CT

          15    scan they said, "If it's bothering you, you don't have

          16    to wear it," so I said okay.  And when I left they

          17    said, "Make sure you see your regular doctor," and

          18    that's what we ended up doing.

          19         Q.    And how did you leave the hospital?

          20         A.    With my prescriptions in hand and back in

          21    the car.

          22         Q.    Did you drive yourself?

          23         A.    Yes.  At that time I was living literally a

          24    half a mile from the -- I was living at 77 South Main.

          25         Q.    And that's less than a mile from the

                                                                     44



           1    hospital?

           2         A.    Yes.

           3         Q.    Okay.  And you followed up with your

           4    primary?

           5         A.    Yes.

           6         Q.    Is that Dr. Spada?

           7         A.    Spada, yes.

           8         Q.    I might be saying it wrong.

           9         A.    No, I might be saying it wrong.  Everybody

          10    says his name differently.

          11         Q.    We know who you're talking about.

          12               When did you follow up with him?

          13         A.    I would like to say the following week or

          14    two.  Again, because of my schedule it's tough to get

          15    in to see the doctor right away so....

          16         Q.    It looks like the 28th which is about two

          17    weeks.

          18         A.    Yes.

          19         Q.    And at that time what were your --

          20         A.    Same symptoms.  That's why I told him,

          21    I said, "Listen, I didn't take the muscle relaxers

          22    because they were making my stomach so upset."  I was

          23    taking the ibuprofen and I said, "The pain is still

          24    there.  But the funny thing is it's not there after

          25    I wake up, I'm fine.  About in an hour or two I can

                                                                     45



           1    start feeling it.  At the end of the day it's like

           2    someone has a hot poker in my back."  And that's the

           3    way it's been since then.  And again, at the time

           4    I didn't know why, but eventually we found out why.

           5         Q.    Had you ever had any pain like that in your

           6    neck?

           7         A.    No, never.

           8         Q.    Ever any medical treatment to your neck?

           9         A.    No.

          10         Q.    At this time when you went to your primary

          11    and you had this excruciating pain you described, did

          12    it just stay in the back of your neck?

          13         A.    Yes.  It's -- like right now it's right

          14    here, but it shoots down my shoulder, but the burning

          15    is right there.

          16         Q.    At the base of your neck in the back?

          17         A.    Yes.  It's to the right.

          18         Q.    To the right?

          19         A.    Yes.  And the whole time during physical

          20    therapy I would always point to it and say, "It hurts

          21    right there."  This is what we're going to do.

          22         Q.    Did it go down your right shoulder or right

          23    arm?

          24         A.    It goes -- the pain, the full day, at the

          25    end of the day the pain is really bad at the neck, but

                                                                     46



           1    you can feel it in the shoulder because of just the

           2    way the nerves go.

           3         Q.    And did it radiate at all into the left

           4    side?

           5         A.    No, no.

           6         Q.    Just the back of the neck on the right

           7    side?

           8         A.    Just the right side.

           9         Q.    And is this something you continue to have

          10    every day?

          11         A.    Yes.  Some days are better depending on any

          12    activity.  If I don't do anything it's a better day.

          13    If I go out and do miniscule things, even if it's

          14    getting in this thing and driving it, just the

          15    constant shifting, it just starts to burn after a

          16    while.

          17         Q.    And driving the truck, it's a stick shift?

          18         A.    Yes.

          19         Q.    And are you right-handed?

          20         A.    Yes.

          21         Q.    So when you saw your primary, what did he

          22    to, if anything?

          23         A.    He did basically the same thing they did in

          24    the emergency room.  He checked my back and checked

          25    everything and he looked at -- I think he looked at

                                                                     47



           1    what he had, the film that he had there, and said,

           2    "I can see why they released you because you really

           3    can't see on there what they did, if there's any major

           4    damage, but my assumption is this."  That's when he

           5    said he thought I would benefit from physical therapy

           6    anyways.

           7         Q.    So did you go to physical therapy?

           8         A.    Yes, I did.  Ten weeks of physical therapy

           9    with Ryan.

          10         Q.    Had you ever had physical therapy before?

          11         A.    Never.

          12         Q.    Did it help at all?

          13         A.    At first I wanted to strangle him because

          14    it seemed like -- it really aggravated it.  And then

          15    he explained, "Let's to through it," and we went

          16    through it and ended up finding a couple of exercises

          17    that helped.  You can definitely tell it was helping,

          18    certain things we were doing.  And he said, "Okay,

          19    let's keep that up."  But again, at the end of the day

          20    I would just still have this burning sensation.  The

          21    exercises I could do and it would help for like an

          22    hour.

          23         Q.    Then it would go back to the same?

          24         A.    Yes.  It always returned to that same

          25    burning at night.

                                                                     48



           1         Q.    And this would happen while you were

           2    sleeping, too?

           3         A.    Well, trying to sleep.

           4         Q.    Did it interfere with sleep?

           5         A.    Yes.  That's the whole problem with it

           6    burning like that, it's hard to find a position.  It's

           7    let's try this and then if I get to sleep I will wake

           8    up fine.  But the problem is being on call you find a

           9    position, you get to sleep, and then two hours later

          10    the phone is going off, "Hey, there is a breakdown" or

          11    "a wreck," and you get up, come back, and start the

          12    whole process all over again.

          13         Q.    Do you have to take anything to help you

          14    sleep?

          15         A.    I take melatonin.

          16         Q.    That's not prescribed, right?

          17         A.    It's not prescribed.

          18         Q.    Anything else?

          19         A.    And I take the ZzzQuil.

          20         Q.    Any other type of medication?

          21         A.    No.  Again, I'm very -- I won't take any

          22    type of sleeping medication if it's prescribed because

          23    when I worked at the Global Operation Center for

          24    Pratt, we worked a rotating shift, and I was the only

          25    guy out of 16 that had -- they took Lunesta, whatever

                                                                     49



           1    it was, and the stories they would tell you about the

           2    dreams they had I didn't want any part of that.

           3         Q.    And also three days a week you're on call,

           4    right?

           5         A.    Yes.

           6         Q.    So I'm clear, when you work at the -- when

           7    you're on call, it's 24/7?

           8         A.    24/7.  They prefer it that way because

           9    I know what I'm doing and I don't mind being on call

          10    because, like I said, it's cyclical.  So I'm off or

          11    I'm at home or I get called out for a couple hours, so

          12    I like it like that.  The schedule works for me.

          13         Q.    All right.  So how often were you going to

          14    physical therapy for those ten weeks?

          15         A.    Three times a week.

          16         Q.    And then is there a reason you stopped the

          17    physical therapy?

          18         A.    Yes.  We got to the ten weeks, I guess

          19    that's what insurance covers.  I guess they can put in

          20    for an extension and I just said that at this point it

          21    doesn't seem like -- I'm at a certain point where we

          22    know what's happening and we know -- but at the end of

          23    the day it was the same result.

          24         Q.    So you weren't making much progress there?

          25         A.    No.

                                                                     50



           1         Q.    So did you back to your primary at some

           2    point?

           3         A.    I can't remember if I went back to see

           4    Dr. Spada or not.

           5         Q.    Did you go to another doctor?

           6         A.    I did because, again, once I found out that

           7    this was burning and stuff, and I am not a doctor fan

           8    so I really don't know any experts, so I asked my

           9    attorney if there is someone I should go see and they

          10    had a couple of recommendations.

          11         Q.    Your attorney recommended that you see

          12    Dr. Jambor?

          13         A.    We went to see Jambor.

          14         Q.    And when did you do that?

          15         A.    Again, it's very tough to find a doctor

          16    that is not going to work through workmen's comp.  As

          17    soon as she heard you're not going through workmen's

          18    comp, they don't want anything to do with you.  That's

          19    why I had to go and say, "Listen, I can't find anyone

          20    that will work," and so there was a recommendation to

          21    go see him and he was very nice.

          22         Q.    And what did he do for you?

          23         A.    He was the one that examined me and really

          24    went into depth on what could be done about it.  He

          25    said, "Listen, unfortunately, the CT scan" -- he was

                                                                     51



           1    absolutely right.  He said, "Unfortunately, the CT

           2    scan that they did won't see if there's any damage, so

           3    you need to go in for your MRI."  He said, "You have

           4    to have that done so we can eliminate that there is

           5    nothing wrong."

           6               And eventually we did the MRI and that is,

           7    low and behold, what opened up the whole thing saying,

           8    "Here is why you're having the pain."  And I don't

           9    understand it.  I don't understand why they don't do

          10    that at the hospital right off the bat because

          11    I wasted ten weeks of physical therapy.

          12         Q.    Had you ever had an MRI before?

          13         A.    No.

          14         Q.    The MRI, they told you what it showed?

          15         A.    Yes.

          16         Q.    And did they have a plan or recommendation

          17    for you after that?

          18         A.    After, when I saw them, they said, "Okay,

          19    the worst word we can tell you is extrusion and that's

          20    what you have in one of your... the medical term,

          21    that's the worst scenario you can have is an

          22    extrusion" and he said, "That's what is most likely

          23    causing your pain."

          24         Q.    And did they tell what you you should do

          25    for that?

                                                                     52



           1         A.    They said an extrusion, unfortunately, is

           2    called an operable condition and that's the only way

           3    to fix it.

           4         Q.    Do surgery?

           5         A.    They can mask it.  They asked if I wanted

           6    to do cortisone shots and I said if it gets to that

           7    point where I can't, then I would seek that out as an

           8    option, but I just don't need needles into my neck,

           9    you know.

          10         Q.    Did you try it at all?

          11         A.    I will try it if I have to.  And again,

          12    they all said that that would just mask it.  It is not

          13    fixing an extrusion, it will fix the pain but not the

          14    problem.

          15         Q.    About surgery, did you discuss surgery with

          16    Dr. Jambor?

          17         A.    Yes, but Jambor, he's not a surgeon so he

          18    recommended -- he had two or three recommendations

          19    and, unfortunately, I ran into the same problem again.

          20    As soon as you say that there is no workmen's comp,

          21    you're not going through workmen's comp they say,

          22    "Sorry, Mr. Jones, we don't deal with accidents."

          23         Q.    Did you ultimately go to another doctor,

          24    Mastrianni?

          25         A.    Yes.

                                                                     53



           1         Q.    Now does he perform surgery?

           2         A.    He informed me after the fact, he said,

           3    "I'm going to do a consultant.  I can recommend

           4    certain surgeons, but ultimately surgery is your

           5    choice."  And again, I don't know doctors.

           6         Q.    But did you go to him for an opinion or did

           7    you go to him for treatment?

           8         A.    No, I went to him to find out what my

           9    options would be, you know, and then what this

          10    condition is.  And he -- actually, he's very

          11    knowledgeable.  He had a lot of surgery history.

          12         Q.    But he can't perform it?

          13         A.    Right.

          14         Q.    And so he recommended other surgeons?

          15         A.    Yes.

          16         Q.    Did you go to any of those?

          17         A.    No.  Again, at this point, because I'm the

          18    operations manager at Pratt & Whitney, I was the only.

          19    I just hired a deputy.

          20         Q.    Okay.

          21         A.    Once she is up and trained, which

          22    unfortunately doesn't happen overnight, but once she's

          23    up and trained I do plan on getting the surgery

          24    because I can't go on like this.  But I also can't --

          25    in my position I can't say I need to be out for 8 to

                                                                     54



           1    12 weeks.

           2         Q.    There's no one to replace you?

           3         A.    No.  I'm the operations manager.  There is

           4    no one to replace me, nor would I want someone to --

           5    force someone to say, "Hey, sorry, I'm going out for

           6    surgery and you need to work Friday, Saturday and

           7    Sunday for the next eight weeks."  That's not

           8    something I would do to somebody.

           9         Q.    It's difficult because of the schedule?

          10         A.    Yes.

          11         Q.    You recently hired a deputy, you said?

          12         A.    Yes.  It will be probably take six months

          13    to a year to get her up to speed.

          14         Q.    When did you hire her?

          15         A.    Two months ago.

          16         Q.    And what's her name?

          17         A.    Rosario Puntio.

          18         Q.    And so you are planning to have surgery?

          19         A.    Yes.

          20         Q.    Have you consulted with any surgeons?

          21         A.    No, not yet.  Again, I would like to make

          22    sure that -- I don't know if you know what it entails,

          23    what has to be done.

          24         Q.    What did they tell you?

          25         A.    Again, you'd think it's the back so they'd

                                                                     55



           1    come in from here, but they have to cut next to your

           2    esophagus, move everything over and try to fuse the

           3    disc back in place.  It just gives me the heebies

           4    thinking about it.

           5         Q.    But it's something that you feel you need

           6    to do?

           7         A.    It's something that I know I need to do

           8    because everyone, the doctors and everyone, it's

           9    operable, the only way to fix it.

          10         Q.    Did they tell you about the risks involved?

          11         A.    Yes.

          12         Q.    So as of right now you don't have any

          13    scheduled appointments?

          14         A.    No, no.  I want to make sure that I can

          15    leave work comfortable.

          16         Q.    Okay.  And you believe that will be when?

          17         A.    I would believe sometime, again, depends on

          18    the schedule and depends on -- there's a lot of

          19    changing things that happen at Pratt.  Obviously we're

          20    combining with another company now so I would say

          21    spring.

          22         Q.    All right.  Are there any other medical

          23    treatment or doctors that you went to?

          24         A.    No, not that I can think of.  No.

          25         Q.    And the last doctor that you went to, is

                                                                     56



           1    that Dr. Mastrianni?

           2         A.    Yes.

           3         Q.    And before -- did your attorney recommend

           4    him or somebody else?

           5         A.    Well, again, because I was finding everyone

           6    I called didn't want to deal with me I reached out for

           7    a recommendation.  And I'm actually glad.  He did

           8    thousands of those surgeries.  He actually got me to

           9    relax a little bit about it.

          10         Q.    All right.  Beforehand, when was the last

          11    time you had medical treatment?

          12         A.    I'm not a doctor person, so I don't usually

          13    go.  But the last time would have been my annual

          14    checkup with Dr. Spada.

          15         Q.    And then the last --

          16         A.    I'm sorry.  There was a couple of emergency

          17    room examinations where I got something in my eye.

          18         Q.    But related to this accident?

          19         A.    No, nothing.  Nothing.  No.

          20         Q.    So related to the accident, did you see

          21    Dr. Jambor just two times.

          22         A.    I believe I saw him twice and then his

          23    assistant once and I can't remember his assistant's

          24    name, because he was out that day, but they assured me

          25    when I got to his office that he was very

                                                                     57



           1    knowledgeable and he actually was.

           2         Q.    From the records I have, it looks like the

           3    last time you went was August 23, 2018 about a year

           4    ago; is that right?

           5         A.    I guess.  I don't keep a log when I go.

           6         Q.    I have the records, but I'm asking you.

           7         A.    Yes.

           8         Q.    So from when you saw him a year ago, other

           9    than seeing Dr. Mastrianni one time, have you had any

          10    other medical treatment in the last year?

          11         A.    No.

          12         Q.    So your current condition, has it changed

          13    at all?

          14         A.    No.  It just stays steady.  And again,

          15    based on all the doctors that I have seen, including,

          16    you know, they've all said that, unfortunately, it

          17    becomes a harder operation the longer you keep it with

          18    the disc slipped or extruded.  The longer you wait,

          19    the harder, the more -- the recovery time is going to

          20    be longer.

          21         Q.    And what did they tell you the recovery

          22    time was?

          23         A.    Eight to twelve weeks.

          24         Q.    And you have to be out of work during that

          25    time?

                                                                     58



           1         A.    Yes.

           2         Q.    From both jobs?

           3         A.    Yes.  Again, they said everyone's recovery

           4    is different, so that's why they say eight to twelve.

           5         Q.    I understand.  Now, I know you told me it's

           6    difficult to look up, that's part of your job?

           7         A.    Uh-hum.

           8         Q.    Are there any other activities or things

           9    you do on a regular basis?

          10         A.    This is the first year I haven't really

          11    because usually come springtime I'm hard and heavy

          12    into jogging and going to the gym but I don't do that.

          13         Q.    How often would you go jogging before the

          14    accident?

          15         A.    Three times a week.

          16         Q.    How far would you go generally?

          17         A.    Five to seven miles was my route.

          18         Q.    Did you do that year round?

          19         A.    Not during the winter months.  But I would

          20    say springtime through probably November.

          21         Q.    Have you been able to go jogging since?

          22         A.    No.  I know if I jog like ten minutes this

          23    will be burning.

          24         Q.    Have you tried?

          25         A.    Oh, no.  No.  I just know.  Because, again,

                                                                     59



           1    I -- it's a quarter mile back and forth from my office

           2    through the two buildings that I cover and everything,

           3    and just walking that route at work it just starts

           4    burning.

           5         Q.    And that's required of your job?

           6         A.    Oh, yeah.  I have to cover the entire two

           7    facilities so....

           8         Q.    It's about a quarter of a mile, you said?

           9         A.    It's about a quarter of mile from my office

          10    through the Building 220 and the Building 410 which

          11    I also cover so.....

          12         Q.    How much walking would you say you do on an

          13    average day for your job?

          14         A.    When I had a pedometer on me it was nine

          15    miles a day.

          16         Q.    And so you're still able to do that, but

          17    it's difficult?

          18         A.    Yes.  I actually -- when you say "still

          19    able to do it," by the end of the day I'm getting in

          20    my car and if I have to go to the other building

          21    I drive, I don't walk it.  It stinks because I'm

          22    constantly starting and stopping.  I don't have a

          23    company car so....

          24         Q.    So the nine miles is what you used to do?

          25         A.    The nine miles is, on a busy day, that's

                                                                     60



           1    what I used to do.

           2         Q.    And what would you say it is now on

           3    average?

           4         A.    On average, I'd say it's at least five.  If

           5    it's busy and there's a problem in 410 and I'm

           6    constantly going back and forth it's nine miles a day.

           7         Q.    And did you go to the gym on a regular

           8    basis before the accident?

           9         A.    Probably once or twice a week at work.

          10    There's a work gym.

          11         Q.    Do you have to be a member or through work?

          12         A.    No, it's through work.

          13         Q.    And have you been since the accident?

          14         A.    No.

          15         Q.    Can you give me some examples of anything

          16    else that's been affected by your injuries from the

          17    accident?

          18         A.    Again, I'm always just crazy careful now.

          19    It's not like I jump into things and just do them.

          20    I pause and think, okay, what's this going to do to

          21    affect my day.

          22         Q.    All right.  Is there anything that you

          23    can't do at all other that when you've told us about?

          24         A.    I'm not going to say you can't do at all

          25    because if I want to do it I will do it, but it will

                                                                     61



           1    cause me great aggravation in the end.

           2         Q.    Other than jogging or the gym, anything

           3    else?

           4         A.    Not that I can think of other than work.

           5    I'm a workaholic, unfortunately.

           6         Q.    How many hours, combined, the two jobs,

           7    would you say you work a week?

           8         A.    I would say a minimum of 36 at Pratt and

           9    another 10 to 15 hours so probably 55 to 60 hours a

          10    week.

          11         Q.    And it's pretty much every day of the week,

          12    right?

          13         A.    Well, every week, yeah.

          14         Q.    Between the two jobs.  Do you ever have a

          15    day off?

          16         A.    I take Thursday nights off.

          17         Q.    Okay.  Give me a second.

          18                    (Discussion held off the record.)

          19         Q.    Do you have any outstanding medical bills

          20    that you know of?

          21         A.    Other than the ones that I kept for the

          22    therapy, I know that was over 4,000-some dollars.

          23         Q.    Did insurance cover it?

          24         A.    Insurance covered it, but I keep getting

          25    letters from the insurance company saying, "This looks

                                                                     62



           1    like this was from an accident, are you currently

           2    seeking anything?"  I have to fill out, you know,

           3    checks in the boxes and send it back to them.  But I'm

           4    sure, depending, I don't know how it works with the

           5    operation and all that, that might be....

           6         Q.    An expense there?

           7         A.    Yes.

           8         Q.    Any out-of-pocket expenses?

           9         A.    Other than my co-pays, because I use my --

          10    I have an HSA account, so whenever I go to these it's

          11    the co-pay.

          12         Q.    Do you know the co-pay?

          13         A.    I don't.  I think it's $35 or $25.

          14         Q.    Did you have a deductible?

          15         A.    I'm sure there's a deductible.  Again,

          16    I don't keep track because I have money automatically

          17    go into the HSA.  Every time they say I owe something,

          18    I swipe it and be done with it.

          19         Q.    Okay.  Have you ever been convicted of a

          20    crime?

          21         A.    No.

          22         Q.    Okay.  I think that's all I have.  Your

          23    attorney may have some questions.

          24                    MR. O'BRIEN:  No questions.

          25                    MS. FRARE:  Thank you very much.

           1                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           2                    MS. FRARE:  I hope you feel better.

           12                  MR. HARRISON:  Good morning.           09:13AM

           13            For the Claimant, KBR, I am Geoffrey         09:13AM

           15            is Elisha Barron from Susman Godfrey,        09:13AM

           16            who will be giving our opening               09:13AM

           17            statement.  We also have Vanessa             09:13AM

           20                  We have our two witnesses here         09:13AM

           21            today, we have Haresh Divanji, and we        09:13AM

           22            have Aman Ahmad.  They will introduce        09:13AM

           23            themselves right before their                09:13AM

           24            testimony.  And then we have two             09:13AM

            4            thank you.                                   09:13AM

            6                  MR. HELLER:  Yeah.  Maury Heller       09:13AM

            7            from the firm of Garvey Schubert             09:13AM

            8            Barer.  With me is Jeanne Barenholtz,        09:13AM

            9            also Garvey Schubert.  And Yeli Zhou,        09:13AM

           10            also Garvey Schubert.  And Fahd              09:14AM

           11            Mukhtar of MFC will also be here.  He        09:14AM

           12            is here in the building so he should         09:14AM

           13            be coming shortly in at any moment.          09:14AM

           14                  Regarding the witnesses, I think       09:14AM

           15            the agreement was that witnesses who         09:14AM

           16            have not yet testified will not be           09:14AM

           17            present during the testimony of              09:14AM

           18            others.  So to the extent that both          09:14AM

           19            witnesses are here, I gather and I           09:14AM

           20            assume that KBR will be sending one of       09:14AM

           21            them out while the initial testimony         09:14AM

           22            is given.                                    09:14AM

           23                  MR. HARRISON:  That is correct.        09:14AM

           24                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  And there is        09:14AM

           25            no issue with them being present             09:14AM

            3                  MR. HELLER:  I certainly have no       09:14AM

            4            problem with that.                           09:14AM

            5                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay,               09:14AM

            6            terrific.                                    09:14AM

            7                  So the conduct of the hearing is       09:14AM

            8            something that we've addressed in            09:14AM

            9            detail in procedural orders leading up       09:14AM

           10            to today.  So unless there are any           09:14AM

           11            questions, I don't intend to go over         09:14AM

           12            any of those procedural details.             09:14AM

           13                  Are there any issues that we           09:14AM

           14            need to cover in terms of the ground         09:14AM

           15            rules?                                       09:14AM

           16                  MR. HARRISON:  No.                     09:14AM

           17                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  And          09:14AM

           18            then this is kind of like a movie            09:14AM

           19            theater in the sense that it's a good        09:15AM

           20            time to check and make sure our cell         09:15AM

           23            housekeeping matter I wanted to              09:15AM

           13            who is keeping track, and you can            09:15AM

           14            confer at breaks, and then if there is       09:15AM

           15            any issue that arises at breaks about        09:15AM

           16            how we are keeping track of time, we         09:15AM

           17            will have the Court Reporter's               09:15AM

           18            information as a backup.                     09:15AM

           19                  I don't expect there to be any         09:15AM

           20            issues with that.  We have two days.         09:15AM

           21            We have a plan for the witnesses.  I         09:15AM

           22            am sure we will be able to get through       09:15AM

           23            it all.  But just in case, that's the        09:15AM

           24            procedure that we will be following.         09:16AM

           25                  So who is going to be keeping          09:16AM

            3                  MR. HARRISON:  Vanessa Santos          09:16AM

            4            for the Claimant.                            09:16AM

            7                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  So if        09:16AM

            8            you can -- I'm not necessarily going         09:16AM

            9            to remember to remind you, so if you         09:16AM

           10            can remember to check in each with           09:16AM

           11            other at breaks so that we can put on        09:16AM

           12            the record when we come back how much        09:16AM

           13            time has been spent, that would be           09:16AM

           14            great.                                       09:16AM

           15                  Are there any other issues that        09:16AM

           16            either side would like to address            09:16AM

           17            before we get to opening statements?         09:16AM

           20                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Okay.  I will       09:16AM

           21            invite the Claimant to come up.  We          09:16AM

           22            had agreed on 15 minutes.                    09:16AM

            1                     OPENING - CLAIMANT

            2                  As you noted at the prehearing         09:16AM

            3            conference, the parties agree on the         09:16AM

            4            framework for this dispute.  It's a          09:16AM

            5            straightforward contract dispute.            09:16AM

            6            It's governed by New York law.  The          09:16AM

            7            contract at issue is the November 5,         09:16AM

            8            2013 Ammonia Technology License              09:17AM

            9            Agreement, and specifically three            09:17AM

           10            termination provisions, 11.3, 11.4,          09:17AM

           11            and 11.5.                                    09:17AM

           12                  Now, MFC acknowledges in its           09:17AM

           13            brief that the arbitrator under New          09:17AM

           14            York law is obligated to look to the         09:17AM

           15            parties' intent in construing these          09:17AM

           16            agreements and that special deference        09:17AM

           17            is given where agreements are heavily        09:17AM

           18            negotiated, like the November 5th            09:17AM

           19            agreement, by sophisticated parties          09:17AM

           20            like KBR and MFC.                            09:17AM

           21                  MFC offers a number of                 09:17AM

           22            interpretations in its pre-hearing           09:17AM

           23            brief of 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5, but           09:17AM

           24            those interpretations are refuted by         09:17AM

           25            the plain language, by the extrinsic         09:17AM

                                                                11

            2            documentary evidence.  They are              09:17AM

            3            refuted by MFC's witnesses own               09:17AM

            4            testimony and their statements, and          09:17AM

            5            certainly not supported by that              09:17AM

            6            testimony.  And the law does not             09:17AM

            7            support their reading.  So I will walk       09:17AM

            8            through each.                                09:17AM

            9                  The first argument that MFC            09:17AM

           10            advances in its pre-hearing brief at         09:17AM

           11            Page 14 is that 11.4 could not have          09:18AM

           12            been intended to apply before MFC            09:18AM

           13            achieved Financial Close.  Now just          09:18AM

           14            looking at the three termination             09:18AM

           15            provisions shows why that doesn't make       09:18AM

           16            sense.  11.3 and 11.5 both expressly         09:18AM

           17            reference Financial Close and link the       09:18AM

           18            availability of those termination            09:18AM

           19            provisions to the owner having not           09:18AM

           20            achieved Financial Close by a certain        09:18AM

           21            date.                                        09:18AM

           22                  11.4, on the other hand, is            09:18AM

           23            silent as to Financial Close.  The           09:18AM

           24            only reasonable interpretation of that       09:18AM

           25            is that 11.4 is available without            09:18AM

                                                                12



            1                     OPENING - CLAIMANT

            2            reference to whether Financial Close         09:18AM

            3            has or has not happened.  And                09:18AM

            4            certainly it is available before             09:18AM

            5            Financial Close.                             09:18AM

            6                  Now, MFC curiously cites in its        09:18AM

            7            brief to the Ammonia Engineering             09:18AM

            8            Agreement from November 5, 2013.  They       09:18AM

            9            were negotiated simultaneously and           09:18AM

           10            signed on the same day.  MFC says that       09:18AM

           11            the termination provisions in that           09:18AM

           12            agreement support its argument.  They        09:19AM

           13            do not.                                      09:19AM

           14                  So 10.1 is a termination for           09:19AM

           15            convenience provision in the Ammonia         09:19AM

           16            Engineering Agreement.  It begins, "If       09:19AM

           17            during the project of the work,              09:19AM

           18            following the Notice to Proceed,"            09:19AM

           19            Notice to Proceed and Financial Close        09:19AM

           20            are the same, as Mr. Ausaf Qureshi has       09:19AM

           21            said in his Witness Statement.  So           09:19AM

           22            this provision clearly sets forth that       09:19AM

           23            it applies only following the Notice         09:19AM

           24            to Proceed.  KBR and MFC could have          09:19AM

           25            written that language into 11.4.  They       09:19AM

                                                                13



            1                     OPENING - CLAIMANT

            2            could have said, after Financial             09:19AM

            3            Close, or following the Notice to            09:19AM

            4            Proceed, MFC may terminate for               09:19AM

            5            convenience.  They did not.                  09:19AM

            6                  Importantly, also, 10.7 in the         09:19AM

            7            Ammonia Engineering Agreement                09:19AM

            8            incorporates 11.4 and says, "MFC may         09:19AM

            9            also terminate for convenience under         09:19AM

           10            this Agreement pursuant to 11.4."            09:19AM

           11                  So 10.1 applies following Notice       09:19AM

           12            to Proceed.  10.7, incorporating 11.4,       09:20AM

           13            applies before Notice to Proceed.            09:20AM

           14            That is the only reasonable reading of       09:20AM

           15            this Agreement.  If there is any doubt       09:20AM

           16            about the plain language, the                09:20AM

           17            extrinsic evidence regarding 11.4 is         09:20AM

           18            unambiguous.                                 09:20AM

            4            provision from Mr. Ahmad, Mr. Ahsen          09:20AM

            5            Uddin promptly emailed his colleagues        09:20AM

            6            and noted that a new clause of               09:20AM

            7            termination had been introduced that         09:20AM

            9            exercised by MFC "before Notice to           09:20AM

           10            Proceed/Financial Close."                    09:21AM

           11            Unequivocal.  It was to apply before         09:21AM

           12            Notice to Proceed and Financial Close.       09:21AM

           13                  Later that day, he emails his          09:21AM

           14            colleagues again to reference the            09:21AM

           15            willful termination of contracts by          09:21AM

           16            MFC before Notice to Proceed.  He            09:21AM

           17            notes that KBR had originally asked          09:21AM

           18            for 50%.  MFC had negotiated it down         09:21AM

           19            to 30%.  And that "we think this is          09:21AM

           20            fair value and should be accepted."          09:21AM

           21                  So Mr. Ahsen Uddin, at the time        09:21AM

           22            this provision is introduced, is             09:21AM

           23            saying that they expect to pay it            09:21AM

           24            before Notice to Proceed, before             09:21AM

           25            Financial Close, and that they think         09:21AM

                                                                15

            2            30% is a fair early termination fee.         09:21AM

            3            The provision was never again                09:21AM

            4            discussed before the final signing in        09:21AM

            5            November of 2013.                            09:21AM

            6                  MFC's post-termination analysis        09:21AM

            7            says the same thing.  So one week,           09:21AM

            8            February 5, 2016, after KBR sent MFC a       09:22AM

            9            letter saying you have terminated            09:22AM

           10            under 11.4 and you owe us the fee,           09:22AM

           11            that's JX-95.  We have JX-97.  It's an       09:22AM

           12            internal analysis by MFC of the              09:22AM

           13            termination provision in the License         09:22AM

           14            Agreement.  There are three bullet           09:22AM

           15            points.  The first is 11.4.  It says         09:22AM

           16            we are not required to be exclusive          09:22AM

           17            but we are required to pay 30% in case       09:22AM

           18            of termination.                              09:22AM

           19                  The second provision addresses         09:22AM

           20            11.3 and 11.5 together, which is             09:22AM

           21            important.  It addresses termination         09:22AM

           22            without penalty or fee in case               09:22AM

           23            Financial Close does not occur by 30th       09:22AM

           24            April, 2014 and the project is               09:22AM

           25            canceled.  It draws no distinction           09:22AM

            2            between 11.3 and 11.4 in this internal       09:22AM

            3            analysis.                                    09:22AM

            4                  The last bullet point groups all       09:22AM

            5            the other termination clauses that           09:22AM

            6            apply after Notice to Proceed and,           09:22AM

            7            hence, do not apply.  Now, if MFC had        09:23AM

            8            thought that 11.4 only applied after         09:23AM

            9            Notice to Proceed, then it would have        09:23AM

           10            been grouped in with the last bullet         09:23AM

           11            point.  It would not have been listed        09:23AM

           12            first on this presentation.                  09:23AM

           13                  So that's 11.4.  The evidence is       09:23AM

           14            unambiguous.  It was intended and the        09:23AM

           15            parties understood it to apply before        09:23AM

           16            Notice to Proceed and Financial Close.       09:23AM

           17                  I want to talk a little bit            09:23AM

           18            about some of MFC's other arguments,         09:23AM

           19            and I will discuss them by reference         09:23AM

           20            to this March 28, 2016 Termination           09:23AM

           21            Letter from MFC.  It's JX-101.  It was       09:23AM

           22            signed by Ausaf Qureshi who is a             09:23AM

           23            witness in this arbitration.  Mr.            09:23AM

           24            Qureshi does not so much as mention          09:23AM

           25            this exhibit in his Witness Statement.       09:23AM

            2                  In this letter, MFC writes to          09:23AM

            3            KBR and says we are terminating under        09:23AM

            4            11.3.  We hereby cancel the license.         09:23AM

            5                  One of the arguments that MFC          09:24AM

            6            makes in its brief is that even if           09:24AM

            7            11.4 was available, signing the TKIS         09:24AM

            8            contract didn't terminate.  KBR              09:24AM

            9            disagrees and we address that at             09:24AM

           10            length in our pre-hearing brief.  But        09:24AM

           11            even if that is true, there is no            09:24AM

           12            question that MFC terminated by              09:24AM

           13            March 28th of 2016.  The only                09:24AM

           14            termination provision that was               09:24AM

           15            available at this time was 11.4.  So         09:24AM

           16            even if the constructive termination         09:24AM

           17            didn't apply, they have terminated           09:24AM

           18            here.  They say, Mr. Qureshi, he says        09:24AM

           19            in his agreement, that they are              09:24AM

           20            terminating under 11.3, and his              09:24AM

           21            explanation for that is that Midwest         09:24AM

           22            did not proceed with the project             09:24AM

           23            incorporating the KBR technology.            09:24AM

           24                  But that's not what 11.3 says.         09:24AM

           25            11.3 refers to a project that is             09:24AM

                                                                18

            2            canceled.  And MFC's attempt to read         09:24AM

            3            incorporating KBR technology into that       09:25AM

            4            provision is inconsistent with the           09:25AM

            5            plain language and is inconsistent           09:25AM

            6            with the party's conduct.  They never        09:25AM

            7            once referred to project to mean             09:25AM

            8            project with KBR.  Mr. Qureshi, in his       09:25AM

            9            Witness Statement for this                   09:25AM

           10            arbitration, refers to project as the        09:25AM

           11            Posey County fertilizer plant as a           09:25AM

           12            whole.  There is no basis to read            09:25AM

           13            incorporating the KBR technology into        09:25AM

           14            11.3.                                        09:25AM

           15                  There is also the issue that MFC       09:25AM

           16            raises with the meaning of "is               09:25AM

           17            canceled," which is in both 11.3 and         09:25AM

           18            11.5.  MFC wants to read "is canceled"       09:25AM

           19            to mean could be canceled, hasn't yet        09:25AM

           20            succeeded, might at some point in the        09:25AM

           21            future be canceled.  That is not what        09:25AM

           22            the Ammonia License Agreement says.          09:25AM

           23            It says "is cancelled."                      09:25AM

           24                  Reading these three provisions         09:25AM

           25            together, the only reasonable                09:25AM

            1                     OPENING - CLAIMANT

            2            interpretation is that 11.3 and 11.5         09:25AM

            3            were available if the project was            09:26AM

            4            cancelled.  11.4 was the only                09:26AM

            5            termination fee available as long as         09:26AM

            6            the project was proceeding.                  09:26AM

            7                  I want to just address one more        09:26AM

            8            exhibit, and that's JX-59.  MFC cites        09:26AM

            9            this exhibit numerous times in its           09:26AM

           10            pre-hearing brief, which came as a           09:26AM

           11            surprise to KBR, because we think this       09:26AM

           12            exhibit shows unequivocally that MFC         09:26AM

           13            knew that it owed the penalty payment        09:26AM

           14            if it signed a contract with TKIS in         09:26AM

           15            January of 2016.  This is a May 13,          09:26AM

           16            2015, email from Chris Willburn              09:26AM

           17            reporting that on that day, MFC had          09:26AM

           18            requested to waive 11.4, and                 09:26AM

           19            specifically raised the context of MFC       09:26AM

           20            cancelling the agreement due to going        09:26AM

           21            forward with another bidder.  MFC            09:26AM

           22            would not have waived -- requested to        09:26AM

           23            waive a provision that it believed did       09:26AM

           24            not apply.  Nor would it have                09:26AM

           25            requested to waive the 11.4 provision        09:27AM

            2            if it thought that any other of the          09:27AM

            3            termination provisions was available         09:27AM

            5                  MFC knew that those provisions         09:27AM

            6            were not available and that if it            09:27AM

            7            signed a contract with the competing         09:27AM

            8            Ammonia licensor, TKIS, that it would        09:27AM

           11            which is actually at JX-61 but it's          09:27AM

           12            part of the same communication, Aman         09:27AM

           13            Ahmad, the person who negotiated these       09:27AM

           14            agreements, writes to Haresh Divanji,        09:27AM

           20                  He notes again that MFC said           09:27AM

           21            they were expecting this and                 09:27AM

           22            understood the rationale, which is           09:27AM

           23            consistent with JX-8 where Ahsen Uddin       09:27AM

            3            going to another EPC.  It was merely         09:28AM

            4            to compensate KBR in the event that          09:28AM

            5            that happened.                               09:28AM

            6                  Now, this is the email that MFC        09:28AM

            7            cites numerous times.  And it asks the       09:28AM

            8            arbitrator to take the last sentence         09:28AM

            9            in this highlighted provision, if MFC        09:28AM

           10            can't reach Financial Close then MFC         09:28AM

           11            doesn't incur any penalty to mean that       09:28AM

           12            11.4 could not have been available           09:28AM

           13            before Financial Close.  That doesn't        09:28AM

           14            make sense if you read the highlighted       09:28AM

           15            paragraph as a whole.                        09:28AM

           16                  Mr. Ahmad is saying, "MFC will         09:28AM

           17            need to compensate KBR for costs and         09:28AM

           22                  As Mr. Ahmad testified in his          09:28AM

            3            project was cancelled.  It was               09:29AM

            4            shorthand for what 11.5 allows.              09:29AM

            5                  There is no question that MFC          09:29AM

            6            decided to proceed with a competitor.        09:29AM

            7            It did not cancel the project.  As           09:29AM

            8            every single one of MFC's witnesses          09:29AM

            9            testified, they are today pursuing           09:29AM

           12                  MFC attempts to read this              09:29AM

           13            divorced from the plain language of          09:29AM

           14            the contract which requires                  09:29AM

           15            cancellation and divorced from the           09:29AM

           16            extrinsic evidence as a whole, is            09:29AM

           17            inconsistent with New York law.  This        09:29AM

           18            is a case that MFC cites.  You cannot        09:29AM

            9            Termination Clause, we need to bear in       09:31AM

           10            mind the fact that KBR has the burden.       09:31AM

           11            KBR is the Claimant.  This is a              09:31AM

           14            read as written.  And the Termination        09:31AM

            6            company, meaning MFC, in the words of        09:33AM

            7            KBR, had no money and it wasn't              09:33AM

            8            intended to have money.  Up until this       09:33AM

            9            magic date, which everyone in project        09:33AM

           10            finance understands, is called the           09:33AM

           11            Financial Close.  After which, or            09:33AM

           12            simultaneously therewith, MFC, as the        09:33AM

           13            owner, will issue Notice to Proceed to       09:33AM

           17            finance the project becomes available.       09:34AM

           18            Not before.  At that point, anyone           09:34AM

            2            KBR -- a penalty, MFC may either pay         09:34AM

            3            the penalty or dispute it, depending         09:34AM

            4            on the circumstances, but in this            09:34AM

            5            circumstance, let's assume for a             09:34AM

            6            moment that MFC reached Financial            09:34AM

            7            Close with a contractor other than           09:34AM

            8            KBR, such as TKIS, which it did not,         09:34AM

            9            it would, or could within its                09:34AM

           10            discretion, terminate the KBR                09:34AM

           11            contract.  And that termination is not       09:34AM

           12            done upon notice, according to the           09:34AM

           13            terms of the contract.  It's done upon       09:34AM

           14            the payment of the 30% of the license        09:34AM

           15            fee, which KBR repeatedly over and           09:34AM

           16            over again calls a penalty.  That's          09:35AM

           17            how it's done.                               09:35AM

           18                  Now, a couple of things we need        09:35AM

           19            to understand about the Ammonia              09:35AM

           20            License Agreement.  That Ammonia             09:35AM

           21            License Agreement was, as I mentioned        09:35AM

           22            before, heavily negotiated.  It was          09:35AM

           23            accompanied by an engineering                09:35AM

           24            contract, a procurement contract.            09:35AM

            2            fees that it's supposed to be paid           09:35AM

            3            under the License Agreement, is worth        09:35AM

            4            to KBR about $30-plus million.  Not an       09:35AM

            5            insignificant sum.                           09:35AM

            6                  Given that MFC has no money and        09:35AM

            7            KBR acknowledged that MFC has no money       09:35AM

            8            and will not have money until                09:35AM

            9            Financial Close, there is no way that        09:35AM

           10            KBR is ever going to get paid by the         09:35AM

           11            express terms of the contract until          09:35AM

           12            Notice to Proceed is issued to KBR.          09:35AM

           13            None of this money will ever become          09:35AM

           14            available to KBR until Notice to             09:35AM

           15            Proceed.  And that's expressly set out       09:35AM

           16            in the contract.  And this is big            09:36AM

           17            money.  This is not money that anyone        09:36AM

           18            could ever have expected MFC to come         09:36AM

           19            up with in advance of Financial Close.       09:36AM

           20                  So the terms of the contract.          09:36AM

           21            Let's look at that.  And it's easy for       09:36AM

           22            me to talk about this, because I'm           09:36AM

           23            going to tell you what's not in there.       09:36AM

           24            So I'm not going to project anything.        09:36AM

            2            provision.  KBR has no right to              09:36AM

            3            enforce exclusivity upon MFC.  MFC is        09:36AM

            4            entitled, by KBR's own admission, by         09:36AM

            6            Statements, that MFC is entitled to go       09:36AM

            7            do work with a competitor if it so           09:36AM

            8            chooses.  And there is no express            09:36AM

            9            penalty attached to that.  In fact, if       09:36AM

           10            you look at the words of 11.4, it            09:36AM

           11            says, "Owner may terminate this              09:36AM

           15                  It doesn't say that MFC must           09:36AM

           16            terminate if it works with a                 09:37AM

            8            there are only two, the second               09:37AM

            9            restriction is that MFC cannot assign        09:37AM

           12            restrictions.  Those are the only two        09:37AM

           16                  KBR has acknowledged -- has            09:38AM

           17            argued vociferously in its brief that        09:38AM

           22            it does not prohibit MFC from going          09:38AM

           14            theory that this somehow was a penalty       09:38AM

           15            that kept MFC going -- from going to         09:38AM

           16            another, to a competitor.  It doesn't        09:39AM

           17            say that.                                    09:39AM

           18                  And in retrospect, and in Monday       09:39AM

            6            of stuff into it, as they are, to try        09:39AM

            7            to make it at least a little more            09:39AM

            8            palatable, not only for KBR's people         09:39AM

            9            who happen to be here today, but for         09:39AM

           10            their superiors who might also not           09:39AM

           11            have been happy with the fact that MFC       09:39AM

           12            was able to go to another company.           09:39AM

           13            But none of those prohibitions -- this       09:39AM

           14            contract on its face does not prohibit       09:39AM

           15            any of that.                                 09:40AM

           16                  Now, there is a -- this word           09:40AM

           17            floating around called "penalties."          09:40AM

           18            Penalties are unenforceable under New        09:40AM

           19            York law.  Very simple.  And                 09:40AM

           20            everything we hear over and over             09:40AM

           21            again, we have counted about 30 times        09:40AM

           22            in KBR's correspondence where they           09:40AM

           23            refer to this clause as a penalty.           09:40AM

           24            Ms. Barron referred to this clause as        09:40AM

           25            a penalty three times during her             09:40AM

            2            opening statement.  It is a penalty.         09:40AM

            3            It has no relationship to KBR's              09:40AM

            4            damages because KBR has no damages.          09:40AM

            5            Under this contract, the only time KBR       09:40AM

            6            is entitled to get paid is when there        09:40AM

            7            is Financial Close.  So the 9. -- the        09:40AM

            8            $9.5 million license fee only comes          09:40AM

            9            due on the date of Financial Close           09:40AM

           10            expressly.  Notice to Proceed is             09:40AM

           11            issued to KBR.  KBR is then entitled         09:40AM

           12            to bill, and incrementally that is,          09:40AM

           13            for the $9.5 million.  Not before.           09:40AM

           14            Never before.  So at no time during          09:40AM

           15            this whole analysis has KBR ever             09:41AM

           16            suffered any damage under this               09:41AM

           17            Agreement.                                   09:41AM

           18                  Now, KBR has alleged that it had       09:41AM

           19            to do free work.  That it expended           09:41AM

           20            time, man-hours, thousands and               09:41AM

           21            thousands of man-hours, for which we         09:41AM

           22            don't see any time sheets.  We haven't       09:41AM

           23            seen any proof of that, except, of           09:41AM

           24            course, these statements made by these       09:41AM

            4            with me to the lectern, which says           09:41AM

            5            specifically that, "KBR's obligations        09:41AM

            6            under this License Agreement shall not       09:41AM

            7            include," "shall not include any             09:41AM

           11            operating services."  Virtually              09:41AM

           12            everything else other than providing a       09:41AM

           13            Technology License.                          09:41AM

           14                  There is no obligation upon KBR        09:42AM

           15            in this Agreement to provide any of          09:42AM

           16            that.  Not a single one of those             09:42AM

           17            services.  KBR did provide those             09:42AM

           18            services.  And not only that, but KBR        09:42AM

           19            billed MFC for those services and KBR        09:42AM

           20            was paid.  Under separate contracts,         09:42AM

           21            as envisioned by 3.1, KBR was paid for       09:42AM

           22            all the service, anything they decided       09:42AM

           23            to bill.                                     09:42AM

           24                  Now, they might have decided not       09:42AM

           25            to bill some stuff.  And, indeed, as a       09:42AM

            2            sales tactic, that's what companies          09:42AM

            3            sometimes do.  They want to keep a           09:42AM

            4            client in its corral, so they won't          09:42AM

            5            bill the whole thing.  It happens.           09:42AM

            6            You know, these are losses that              09:42AM

            7            companies generally accept as part of        09:42AM

            8            the cost of doing business.  That's          09:42AM

            9            the way it works.                            09:42AM

           10                  But here, these are not -- even        09:42AM

           11            if KBR wasn't paid for any of this           09:42AM

           12            stuff, these are not damages under the       09:42AM

           13            contract.  The only damage KBR can           09:42AM

           14            possibly suffer under the contract is        09:42AM

           15            the failure to pay the license fee.          09:42AM

           16            And, conceptually, that's where the          09:43AM

           17            idea of the Termination Clause pops          09:43AM

           18            in, because if at some point MFC felt        09:43AM

           19            as though it might become liable to          09:43AM

           20            pay this license fee to KBR, I mean,         09:43AM

           21            yes, there was a relationship and            09:43AM

           22            maybe MFC felt a duty, but it didn't         09:43AM

           23            have to feel a duty to KBR to                09:43AM

           24            terminate this contract.  But if it          09:43AM

            4            about to deliver Notice to Proceed, to       09:43AM

            5            potentially another contractor, then         09:43AM

            6            under this document, under the way           09:43AM

            7            this contract is structured, it could        09:43AM

            8            terminate at its own volition, its own       09:43AM

            9            decision, it may do so, it doesn't           09:43AM

           10            have to do so, it can terminate the          09:43AM

           11            contract and pay KBR its penalty.  It        09:43AM

           12            can do that.                                 09:43AM

           13                  And, in fact, had MFC reached          09:43AM

           14            Financial Close ever, it did not, but        09:43AM

           15            had it reached Financial Close, that's       09:43AM

           16            what it probably would have done or          09:43AM

           17            might have done.  I mean, we don't           09:43AM

           18            know because that juncture never             09:44AM

           19            happened.  But nothing under the             09:44AM

           20            contract obligated it to do otherwise.       09:44AM

           21                  Now, you saw some of the               09:44AM

           22            purported admissions by Mr. Uddin            09:44AM

           24            clause that requires that if MFC             09:44AM

            3            terminate before a notice to proceed,        09:44AM

            4            yeah, I mean, that is true.  MFC             09:44AM

            5            could, before a Notice to Proceed, if        09:44AM

            6            it chooses, terminate this contract by       09:44AM

            8                  And perhaps there are situations       09:44AM

            9            where that might be important, or that       09:44AM

           10            it might be necessary for MFC's              09:44AM

           11            business plan.  For example, if it's         09:44AM

           12            simply not getting along with KBR, if        09:44AM

           13            it feels as though it must leave KBR         09:44AM

           14            because there is a flaw, they detect a       09:44AM

           15            flaw in its technology, because, etc.,       09:44AM

           17            possibilities.  Then, yes, MFC could         09:44AM

           18            exercise this clause before a Notice         09:44AM

           19            to Proceed.                                  09:44AM

           20                  It doesn't -- there is nothing         09:44AM

           22            that says that this clause can't be          09:45AM

           23            exercised after Financial Close and          09:45AM

            7            well have terminated this provision          09:45AM

            8            under 11.4 and paid the fee.  It might       09:45AM

            9            have done that.                              09:45AM

           10                  But what happened in the               09:45AM

           11            interim, it's kind of complicated,           09:45AM

           12            that process, because in March of            09:45AM

           13            2016, KBR -- sorry, in January of            09:45AM

           14            2016, KBR sent a notice.  That notice        09:45AM

           15            said that you have, even though you          09:45AM

           16            didn't intend to, even though you            09:45AM

           17            didn't -- and the language says may,         09:45AM

           18            you terminated because you signed a          09:45AM

           19            deal with another contractor.  And, by       09:45AM

           20            the way, that deal, as we will               09:45AM

           21            discuss, and we're not going to do it        09:45AM

           22            in the presence of the witnesses here,       09:45AM

           23            because that is something that remains       09:45AM

           24            highly confidential, no such thing           09:45AM

           25            happened.  There was a deal signed,          09:46AM

                                                                39

            2            nothing else about it was correct,           09:46AM

            3            with TKIS.                                   09:46AM

            4                  But they -- MFC said -- KBR            09:46AM

            5            said, you signed the deal, therefore,        09:46AM

            6            you have terminated for convenience.         09:46AM

            7            I mean, what?  It was a constructive         09:46AM

            8            termination for convenience.  The deal       09:46AM

            9            could easily have said, this contract        09:46AM

           10            could easily have said, if you sign          09:46AM

           11            with a competitor, you pay a fee.  It        09:46AM

           12            didn't say that.  And that's not what        09:46AM

           13            it was intended to do.  It, despite          09:46AM

           14            the 11th hour spin that KBR has put on       09:46AM

           15            it, and despite, apparently, some            09:46AM

           16            internal talk which MFC was not privy        09:46AM

           17            to, that this is why they wanted it in       09:46AM

           18            there.  And, of course, all that             09:46AM

           19            internal talk talks about this being a       09:46AM

           20            penalty.  Okay?  Penalties are               09:46AM

           21            unenforceable.  KBR did not have any         09:46AM

           22            damage.  There's no conceivable damage       09:46AM

           23            under this contract.  It is a penalty,       09:46AM

           24            pure and simple.  It is unenforceable        09:46AM

           25            under New York law.                          09:46AM

            2                  But even putting that aside,           09:46AM

            3            when KBR sent out the Notice in              09:46AM

            4            January, KBR said, we are not                09:47AM

            5            providing you with the technical             09:47AM

            6            services anymore, effectively                09:47AM

            7            terminating the project.  And, of            09:47AM

            8            course, in order to take what KBR says       09:47AM

            9            literally, you must believe that             09:47AM

           10            Sections 11.3 and 11.5 mean exactly          09:47AM

           11            the same thing, even though they use         09:47AM

           12            different words.                             09:47AM

           13                  So section 11.3 says that the          09:47AM

           14            owner, meaning MFC, can terminate the        09:47AM

           15            agreement before Financial Close.  If        09:47AM

           16            it does not reach Financial Close            09:47AM

           17            prior to April 30th, and despite its         09:47AM

           18            best efforts, and, and this project is       09:47AM

           19            therefore canceled.  Pay careful             09:47AM

           20            attention to the word "this" and             09:47AM

           21            "therefore."  Okay?                          09:47AM

           22                  If MFC does not reach Financial        09:47AM

           23            Close, April 30, 2014, this project,         09:47AM

           24            okay, not the project, but this              09:47AM

            2            that was envisioned by this particular       09:47AM

            3            document of which it is a part, is           09:48AM

            4            cancelled, that MFC can terminate            09:48AM

            5            without any payment or any penalty or        09:48AM

            7                  Then 11.5, which is different          09:48AM

            8            words, does not use the words "best          09:48AM

            9            efforts."  It talks about if the             09:48AM

           10            Financial Close does not happen before       09:48AM

           12                  MR. HARRISON:  Pardon me, if I         09:48AM

           13            could.  I'm sorry.  It's just been           09:48AM

           16            do you have?                                 09:48AM

           17                  MR. HELLER:  I think we also           09:48AM

           18            timed you at about that, so I am ready       09:48AM

           19            to wrap up, but...                           09:48AM

           20                  MR. HARRISON:  Okay.                   09:48AM

           21                  MR. HELLER:  It says the North         09:48AM

           22            American project is cancelled.  That         09:48AM

           23            is a broader statement.  There was --        09:48AM

           24            this was a component of that project,        09:48AM

            2            But there is much more to it.                09:48AM

            3                  So if anything that happened --        09:48AM

            4            even without KBR's best efforts, I'm         09:48AM

            5            sorry, MFC's best efforts, that would        09:48AM

            6            be -- give MFC the right to terminate        09:48AM

            7            without fee.                                 09:48AM

            8                  So briefly, if I might sum up.         09:48AM

            9            You make your bed, you sleep in it.          09:48AM

           10            If you argue that a contract is              09:49AM

           11            unambiguous, if you argue that its           09:49AM

           12            terms mean what they say, as KBR has,        09:49AM

           13            you have to live with that.  There is        09:49AM

           14            nothing in these, in this Agreement          09:49AM

           15            that comports with what KBR says it          09:49AM

           16            says.  This Agreement is very clear as       09:49AM

           17            to what it says.  No exclusivity and         09:49AM

            2            make sure that you keep your voice up.       09:54AM

            3                  THE WITNESS:  Sure.                    09:54AM

            4                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  And she may,        09:54AM

            5            or I may remind you from time to time,       09:54AM

            6            she might -- I don't know, Rebecca, do       09:54AM

            7            you wave or do you audibly ask him to        09:54AM

            8            speak up?                                    09:54AM

            9                  THE REPORTER:  I'll audibly ask.       09:54AM

           10                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So the second       09:54AM

           11            thing is that if you are asked a             09:55AM

           12            question and you don't understand it,        09:55AM

           13            what's most helpful to me would be if        09:55AM

           14            you ask for it to be rephrased or            09:55AM

           15            repeated.  Try and answer the                09:55AM

           16            questions as directly as you can that        09:55AM

           17            you are asked.  And, beyond that, we         09:55AM

           18            should be okay.                              09:55AM

           19                  So if you would like to call the       09:55AM

           13            Q.    Mr. Ahmad, could you introduce         09:55AM

           14       yourself to the arbitrator and state your         09:55AM

           19            Q.    And where do you live?                 09:55AM

           20            A.    I live in Dubai in the United Arab     09:55AM

           21       Emirates, and I traveled here for this            09:56AM

           22       hearing.                                          09:56AM

           23            Q.    When did you first begin working       09:56AM

           24       with Fatima or MFC on their fertilizer plant      09:56AM

           25       in the United States?                             09:56AM

                                                                46

            2            A.    This would go back to early 2012       09:56AM

            3       before --                                         09:56AM

            4                  MR. HELLER:  I'm going to              09:56AM

            5            object.  The procedure was that the          09:56AM

            6            witness would be introduced and then         09:56AM

            7            immediately subjected to                     09:56AM

            8            cross-examination.  We had proposed          09:56AM

            9            giving also our witnesses a brief            09:56AM

           10            period to testify.  That was withdrawn       09:56AM

           11            with the expectation that would have         09:56AM

           12            been denied.  So to the extent that          09:56AM

           13            this is direct examination, we object.       09:56AM

           14            There is no room in the schedule for         09:56AM

           15            direct examination.  That's what the         09:56AM

           16            Witness Statement is for.                    09:56AM

           17                  MS. BARRON:  May I respond?  We        09:56AM

           18            saw that you allowed for ten minutes         09:56AM

           19            of introductory testimony, but we are        09:56AM

           20            happy to dispense with that and --           09:56AM

           21                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  The                 09:56AM

           22            procedure, I'm looking at paragraph          09:56AM

           23            12, I think it refers to no more than        09:57AM

           24            ten minutes of limited introduction,         09:57AM

           25            during which time counsel shall ask          09:57AM

                                                                47

            2            the witness to affirm the truth and          09:57AM

            3            accuracy of the testimony given, or          09:57AM

            4            state any corrections, and that no new       09:57AM

            5            evidence shall be introduced during          09:57AM

            6            direct testimony.  So I think the ten        09:57AM

            7            minutes which you can point to matters       09:57AM

            8            in the testimony, but nothing to add.        09:57AM

            9            So if we're trying to warm-up the            09:57AM

           10            witness, that's fine, but there's no         09:57AM

           11            new evidence.                                09:57AM

           12                  MR. HARRISON:  And, Arbitrator,        09:57AM

           13            we are happy to limit it to two              09:57AM

           14            minutes.                                     09:57AM

           15                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Well, that's        09:57AM

           16            up to you, but the procedure order           09:57AM

           17            allows each party to have up to ten          09:57AM

           18            minutes with those restrictions.             09:57AM

           20            Q.    Mr. Ahmad, you can continue --         09:57AM

           21            A.    Thank you.                             09:57AM

           22            Q.    -- if you would like, explaining       09:57AM

           23       when you first began working with Fatima.         09:57AM

           24            A.    Sure.  So this would go back to        09:57AM

           25       early 2012, prior to the formation of MFC as      09:57AM

            4       Agreement was executed in 2013, it was just       09:58AM

            5       enormous amount of effort that was invested       09:58AM

           16            to do with the period before 2012.           09:58AM

           17            There is nothing in the Witness              09:58AM

           22       believe there is reference to a meeting in        09:58AM

           17       edited very significantly where needed,           09:59AM

           18       redlined it, had subsequent conversations         09:59AM

            9            A.    Good morning.                          10:00AM

           10            Q.    You had just testified in response     10:00AM

           11       to questions by your counsel that you had         10:00AM

           12       conversations with members of the legal team      10:00AM

           13       at KBR that assisted you in preparing your        10:00AM

           14       Witness Statement; isn't that correct?            10:00AM

           15            A.    Correct.                               10:00AM

           16            Q.    Okay.  And in addition to those        10:00AM

           17       conversations, you also had conversations         10:00AM

           18       with persons at KBR who were not part of the      10:00AM

           19       legal team; isn't that right?                     10:01AM

           20            A.    We had conversations with a lot of     10:01AM

           21       people who were involved in the development       10:01AM

           22       of this project.  So there were a lot of          10:01AM

           23       people who were involved in various phases of     10:01AM

           24       the project, correct.                             10:01AM

            4            A.    I wouldn't say I had conversations     10:01AM

            5       with a lot of other people outside of our         10:01AM

            6       legal team, because I am -- was directly          10:01AM

            7       involved in the development of this project       10:01AM

            8       from the beginning, so I am very familiar         10:01AM

           11       lot of conversations with a lot of people,        10:01AM

           12       but you might have had conversations with         10:01AM

           13       some people who are not lawyers, right?           10:01AM

           14            A.    No, I did not.                         10:01AM

           15            Q.    Did you speak, for example, to         10:01AM

           16       Dennis Lippmann?                                  10:01AM

           17            A.    No, I did not.                         10:01AM

           18            Q.    Okay.  You know who Mr. Lippmann       10:01AM

           19       is, correct?                                      10:01AM

           20            A.    Yes, I know --                         10:01AM

           21            Q.    Okay.  Who is Mr. Lippmann?            10:01AM

           22            A.    He used to be Vice President of        10:01AM

           23       Ammonia at KBR.  He no longer works for KBR.      10:01AM

           24       I believe he now works for TKIS.                  10:01AM

           25            Q.    Okay.  And would it be fair to say     10:01AM

            7            A.    He was deeply involved.  I would       10:02AM

            8       say that his role was -- how would you define     10:02AM

           11            A.    No.  I was the lead negotiator.        10:02AM

           12            Q.    Okay.  And was he by your side or      10:02AM

           13       was he taking a middle seat during the course     10:02AM

           14       of these negotiations?                            10:02AM

           15            A.    He was by my side, because he was      10:02AM

           16       the Vice President for Ammonia.  So he had a      10:02AM

           17       say in technical matters.                         10:02AM

            2            Q.    So your job as marketing, as the       10:05AM

            3       marketing and sales VP, right, was to develop     10:05AM

            4       this relationship, the relationship you           10:05AM

            5       discussed with the Fatima Group and               10:05AM

            6       subsequently with MFC, which was formed by        10:05AM

            7       Fatima Group as its sponsor, correct?             10:05AM

            8            A.    Amongst other clients, correct.        10:06AM

            9            Q.    All right.  But this is one of         10:06AM

           10       those clients, right?                             10:06AM

           11            A.    Sure, sure.                            10:06AM

           12            Q.    You have other clients.  This was      10:06AM

           13       a relationship that you had developed,            10:06AM

           14       correct?                                          10:06AM

           15            A.    It was a relationship that I was       10:06AM

           16       leading for this pursuit.  I think, as you        10:06AM

           17       may be aware, you know, the Fatima Group and      10:06AM

           18       KBR or KBR's predecessor, M.W. Kellogg, has a     10:06AM

           19       very old relationship with the Fatima Group.      10:06AM

           20       We've done other projects for the Fatima          10:06AM

           21       Group in Pakistan.  So it was not as though       10:06AM

           22       this was our first venture in developing          10:06AM

           23       business with the Fatima Group, but for this      10:06AM

           24       particular project, I was leading the             10:06AM

           25       development of the project with MFC and --        10:06AM

            2       well, with Fatima and then subsequently with      10:06AM

            3       MFC.                                              10:06AM

            4            Q.    Okay.  So there was a preexisting      10:06AM

            5       relationship with KBR.  This was something,       10:06AM

            6       if you had developed and it had come to           10:06AM

            7       fruition, you would have gotten credit for,       10:06AM

            8       financial credit, correct?                        10:06AM

            9            A.    Absolutely.                            10:06AM

           10            Q.    Okay.  Now, you discussed in your      10:06AM

           11       Witness Statement a series of negotiations        10:07AM

           12       that took place between KBR and                   10:07AM

           13       representatives of the Fatima Group, soon to      10:07AM

           14       become MFC, which took place during mid to        10:07AM

           15       late 2012; is that correct?                       10:07AM

           16            A.    Yes, there were several meetings.      10:07AM

           17            Q.    Okay.  When you say "several           10:07AM

           18       meetings," are you talking about certainly        10:07AM

           19       more than one or two, right?  There were a        10:07AM

           20       number of meetings?                               10:07AM

           21            A.    Correct.                               10:07AM

           22            Q.    All right.  And during the course      10:07AM

           23       of those meetings, there was a lot of             10:07AM

           24       negotiation going on?                             10:07AM

           25            A.    I wouldn't characterize it as          10:07AM

                                                                59

            2       negotiation at that time, because MFC's           10:07AM

            3       project was at very early stage.  So a lot of     10:08AM

            4       the discussions or conversations or meeting       10:08AM

            5       or dialogue that we had with MFC at that time     10:08AM

            6       was how we could help MFC develop the project     10:08AM

            7       and identify various issues that developers       10:08AM

            8       should be -- should keep in mind.  So they        10:08AM

            9       were not really negotiations because we had       10:08AM

           10       not entered into contracts at that time.          10:08AM

           11            Q.    All right.  But the bottom line is     10:08AM

           12       you were offering KBR's expertise to MFC to       10:08AM

           13       help and develop the project, correct?            10:08AM

           14            A.    Yes.                                   10:08AM

           15            Q.    And was that offer of KBR's            10:08AM

           16       expertise, was that ever withdrawn?               10:08AM

           17            A.    I'm not sure I understand.             10:08AM

           18            Q.    Did you ever reach a point during      10:08AM

           19       your communications with MFC where you or         10:08AM

           20       someone from KBR said, we're not offering our     10:09AM

           21       expertise anymore?                                10:09AM

           22            A.    No.                                    10:09AM

           23            Q.    So that would have continued           10:09AM

           24       throughout the course of the relationship,        10:09AM

           25       that KBR had made its expertise available to      10:09AM

            2       MFC; isn't that right?                            10:09AM

            3            A.    At various stages of the project,      10:09AM

            4       we were providing different levels of             10:09AM

            5       expertise.  So at certain points where we         10:09AM

            6       were in the early stages where we needed to       10:09AM

            7       develop the project from scratch, the             10:09AM

            8       expertise was a lot more.  At certain stages,     10:09AM

            9       the expertise was less.  At certain stages,       10:09AM

           10       we had one group involved.  At some stage, we     10:09AM

           11       had another group.  So, again, the project of     10:09AM

           12       this magnitude required a lot of input from a     10:09AM

           13       lot of different people.                          10:09AM

           14            Q.    At KBR?                                10:09AM

           15            A.    At KBR.                                10:09AM

           16            Q.    Okay.  And that input was provided     10:09AM

           17       by KBR; isn't that correct?                       10:09AM

           18            A.    That's right.                          10:09AM

           19            Q.    Okay.  Now, there came a time that     10:09AM

           20       a License Agreement and two other agreements,     10:10AM

           21       meaning the Basic Engineering Agreement and       10:10AM

           22       the Proprietary Equipment Agreement, that         10:10AM

           23       package of three agreements was executed          10:10AM

           24       between MFC and KBR, right?                       10:10AM

           25            A.    Right.                                 10:10AM

            6            Q.    Okay.  And would you consider the      10:10AM

           10            Q.    They had expertise in a wide           10:10AM

           11       variety of areas, particularly with respect       10:10AM

           12       to the production of fertilizer?                  10:10AM

           13            A.    I would say they had expertise in      10:10AM

           14       projects in Pakistan, but their expertise         10:10AM

           15       with setting up projects in the US, this was      10:10AM

           16       the first.                                        10:11AM

           17            Q.    Which is why they came to KBR,         10:11AM

           18       right?                                            10:11AM

           19            A.    That's right.                          10:11AM

           20            Q.    KBR has roots in the United States     10:11AM

           21       and has expertise in the United States,           10:11AM

           22       right?                                            10:11AM

           23            A.    Well, they went to several other       10:11AM

           24       people as well.  I mean, we were one of the       10:11AM

            2       also having discussions with several other        10:11AM

            3       technology licensors or maybe even other          10:11AM

            4       EPCs.                                             10:11AM

            6       when were these documents, the ones we just       10:11AM

            7       recited, when were they executed?                 10:11AM

            8            A.    November 5, 2013.                      10:11AM

            9            Q.    Okay.  So before that, you are         10:11AM

           10       saying that MFC was negotiating with other        10:11AM

           11       potential licensors?                              10:11AM

           12            A.    I wouldn't -- they were having         10:11AM

           13       conversations, perhaps, but I'm not sure if       10:11AM

           14       they were negotiating with others.                10:11AM

           15            Q.    Okay.  So they were having             10:11AM

           16       conversations with other potential licensors.     10:11AM

           17       Did you tell MFC you may not have                 10:11AM

           18       conversations with other potential licensors?     10:11AM

           19            A.    No.                                    10:11AM

           20            Q.    And as far as you knew, those          10:11AM

           21       conversations continued even during --            10:12AM

           22            A.    I wasn't aware of those                10:12AM

           23       conversations at the time we signed the           10:12AM

           24       agreements.                                       10:12AM

           25            Q.    So are you saying that those           10:12AM

                                                                63

            2       conversations stopped once the agreements         10:12AM

            3       were signed?                                      10:12AM

            4            A.    I don't know.                          10:12AM

            5            Q.    You don't know, right?                 10:12AM

            6            A.    I don't know.                          10:12AM

            7            Q.    Okay.                                  10:12AM

            8            A.    But we -- if I may, but, of            10:12AM

            9       course, once you sign with the licensor a         10:12AM

           10       firm contract, the assumption there is that       10:12AM

           11       you are not going to continue dialogue with       10:12AM

           12       other licensors, particularly because you are     10:12AM

           13       relying on that licensor to provide very          10:12AM

           14       specific technical data to EPCs who are in        10:12AM

           15       the process of developing firm EPC numbers        10:12AM

           16       for you such as MFC was having with Toyo,         10:12AM

           17       Tecnimont and Kawasaki.                           10:12AM

           18            Q.    So you are saying that KBR, by         10:12AM

           19       signing the License Agreement, obligated          10:13AM

           20       itself to provide technical data?                 10:13AM

           21            A.    No.                                    10:13AM

           22            Q.    So you are saying that KBR, by         10:13AM

           23       signing the Engineering Agreement, obligated      10:13AM

           24       itself to provide MFC technical data?             10:13AM

           25            A.    We were not obligated to provide       10:13AM

                                                                64

            2       MFC anything.  However, we were providing         10:13AM

            3       MFC, as we had been providing MFC for             10:13AM

            4       18 months now, supporting information to help     10:13AM

            5       them develop the project.                         10:13AM

            6            Q.    And I guess the same question          10:13AM

            7       would apply to the proprietary equipment          10:13AM

            8       contract.  Was KBR obligated to provide MFC       10:13AM

            9       with technical data under the proprietary         10:13AM

           10       equipment contract?                               10:13AM

           11            A.    So the answer would be the same,       10:13AM

           12       that we were not obligated to, but we             10:13AM

           13       provided a lot of information in a way to         10:13AM

           14       help MFC move the project forward.  And that      10:13AM

           15       information included information, for             10:13AM

           16       example, with regard to proprietary               10:13AM

           17       equipment.  We disclosed approved vendor          10:13AM

           18       lists.  We helped MFC identify sources of         10:14AM

           19       equipment in different countries.  There was      10:14AM

           20       a very specific conversation where MFC did        10:14AM

           21       not want to source material and equipment         10:14AM

           22       from India that required us to take certain       10:14AM

           23       vendors off our list.  There were cost            10:14AM

           24       implications.  So, yes, there was a lot of        10:14AM

           25       conversations on -- with regard to the            10:14AM

            2       proprietary equipment, but we were not            10:14AM

            3       obligated.  We were helping MFC take things       10:14AM

            4       forward.                                          10:14AM

            5            Q.    And you took that forward because      10:14AM

            6       you wanted to develop this relationship           10:14AM

            7       hopefully into fruition as a potential EPC        10:14AM

            8       contractor for KBR, right?                        10:14AM

            9            A.    Absolutely not.  Our technology        10:14AM

           10       business is completely independent of our EPC     10:14AM

           11       business.  In fact, I think there are             10:14AM

           12       exhibits where you may see our EPC leaders        10:14AM

           13       trying to request our technology president to     10:14AM

           14       push for exclusivity, and we have completely      10:15AM

           15       pushed back internally on our people saying       10:15AM

           16       that technology licenses are completely           10:15AM

           17       separate.  There was never any intent from        10:15AM

           18       our side to tie technology to EPC, which is       10:15AM

           19       why technology agreements were executed as        10:15AM

           20       the first agreements with no relation or          10:15AM

           21       obligation for MFC to sign EPC with KBR.          10:15AM

           22            Q.    All right.  So let's back away         10:15AM

           23       from the EPC component of this.  It was in        10:15AM

           24       KBR's interest to see that this project           10:15AM

           25       succeeded; isn't that correct?                    10:15AM

            2            A.    It's absolutely correct.  We spent     10:15AM

            3       a lot of time developing it and we had our        10:15AM

            4       name out there and MFC's, you know, when they     10:15AM

            5       were filing for extension of their bonds, it      10:15AM

            6       was being projected in the bond filing that       10:15AM

            7       they had executed contracts with KBR.  So,        10:15AM

            8       yes, we had a reputational risk there, too.       10:15AM

            7       Proceed is delivered to KBR a sizable amount      10:16AM

           11            Q.    All right.  KBR had an interest in     10:16AM

           12       seeing this project succeed, correct?             10:16AM

           13            A.    Correct.                               10:16AM

           14            Q.    And KBR, if, according to the          10:16AM

           15       terms of the -- and I'm not quoting this out      10:16AM

           18       Agreement and the terms of the Proprietary        10:17AM

           20       obligations, those obligations are not            10:17AM

           21       triggered immediately, they are triggered         10:17AM

           22       when Notice to Proceed is delivered to KBR,       10:17AM

           23       correct?                                          10:17AM

           24            A.    We would commence our work only        10:17AM

            3       actual deliverables, would only be triggered      10:17AM

            4       after we -- after they gave us Notice to          10:17AM

            5       Proceed.                                          10:17AM

            6            Q.    And KBR didn't get paid anything       10:17AM

            7       until Notice to Proceed, correct?                 10:17AM

            8            A.    Correct.                               10:17AM

            9            Q.    Under any of its contracts?            10:17AM

           10            A.    The only -- well, if MFC were to       10:17AM

           11       stick with KBR, then our payments would start     10:17AM

           12       at Notice to Proceed, that is correct.            10:17AM

           13            Q.    So the answer is yes?                  10:17AM

           14            A.    If MFC were to stick with KBR, the     10:17AM

           15       answer is yes, we would get paid only after       10:17AM

           16       Notice to Proceed.                                10:17AM

           17            Q.    When you say "stick with KBR," you     10:17AM

           18       mean deliver Notice to Proceed to KBR, right?     10:17AM

           19            A.    Correct.                               10:17AM

           20            Q.    So let's make sure we've got the       10:17AM

           21       terminology straight.                             10:18AM

           22                  So MFC delivers Notice to Proceed      10:18AM

           23       to KBR, these three agreements will kick in,      10:18AM

           24       KBR would start receiving payments, right?        10:18AM

           25            A.    Correct.                               10:18AM

            3       addition, pursuant to these agreements, KBR       10:18AM

            5       deliverables at Notice to Proceed?                10:18AM

            7            Q.    Right?  But not before?                10:18AM

            9       we were providing support before, but             10:18AM

           10       deliverables under the agreements would only      10:18AM

           11       be provided after Notice to Proceed is            10:18AM

           12       provided.                                         10:18AM

           13            Q.    All right.  And you say you were       10:18AM

           14       providing support before, but that support is     10:18AM

           15       not called for by any of these agreements,        10:18AM

           16       correct?                                          10:18AM

           17            A.    I'm not sure I understand.             10:18AM

           18            Q.    There's no provision in any of         10:18AM

           19       these agreements that obligates KBR to            10:18AM

           20       provide what you call support before Notice       10:18AM

           21       to Proceed, right?                                10:18AM

           22            A.    There is nothing that obligates        10:18AM

           23       us.  We were doing it to help the project         10:18AM

            3       good guys, right?                                 10:19AM

            4            A.    We are doing something to support      10:19AM

            5       our customer.                                     10:19AM

            6            Q.    Okay.  That's what you as the          10:19AM

            7       business development/salesperson had an           10:19AM

            8       interest in happening, correct?                   10:19AM

            9            A.    I wouldn't say it's just me as the     10:19AM

           10       business development salesperson or lead.  I      10:19AM

           11       would say it's KBR.  You know, as I mentioned     10:19AM

           12       earlier, KBR had a prior business                 10:19AM

           13       relationship with Fatima that we respected        10:19AM

           14       very much and we still do to this day.  This      10:19AM

           15       was in our interest to see this project go        10:19AM

           16       forward.  Not for me or for John Derbyshire       10:19AM

           17       or for Haresh or anybody, but for KBR to have     10:19AM

           18       its technology used by MFC and have our           10:19AM

           19       customer come into a new market.                  10:19AM

           20            Q.    And you would get paid?                10:19AM

           21            A.    That's right.                          10:19AM

           22            Q.    So, yes, best for KBR, best for        10:19AM

           23       all concerned, you, your team, everyone would     10:19AM

           24       do better if this deal actually happened,         10:19AM

           25       right?                                            10:20AM

            2            A.    Yeah.  I mean, KBR is a                10:20AM

            3       publicly-traded firm, as you are aware.  You      10:20AM

            4       know, we are in the business to provide           10:20AM

            5       services and earn a profit.  And, you know,       10:20AM

            6       that's -- so the answer to your question          10:20AM

            7       would be yes.                                     10:20AM

            8            Q.    Okay.  Now, in order to -- for KBR     10:20AM

            9       to provide services before, before Notice to      10:20AM

           10       Proceed, right, which it was not obligated to     10:20AM

           11       do, as you can see under these contracts,         10:20AM

           12       there are people at KBR who actually have to      10:20AM

           13       do work, correct?  Yes?                           10:20AM

           14            A.    Correct.                               10:20AM

           15            Q.    You need to answer audibly to          10:20AM

           16       answer the question.                              10:20AM

           17            A.    Yes, correct.                          10:20AM

           18            Q.    Okay.  And these people can come       10:20AM

           19       from different parts of KBR, providing these      10:20AM

           20       types of services that you thought KBR ought      10:20AM

           21       to be performing during this time, right?         10:20AM

           22            A.    Um-hum.                                10:20AM

           23            Q.    Okay.  And these people who            10:20AM

           24       perform these services, they have to keep a       10:21AM

            2       perform, right?                                   10:21AM

            3            A.    That's right.                          10:21AM

            4            Q.    Okay.  And do you have a timesheet     10:21AM

            5       system at KBR?                                    10:21AM

            6            A.    We do.                                 10:21AM

            7            Q.    Okay.  And so these individuals        10:21AM

            8       who were performing work for KBR would have       10:21AM

            9       to -- I'm sorry, for MFC, would have to make      10:21AM

           10       a notation in a timesheet that they were          10:21AM

           11       doing work for MFC, right?                        10:21AM

           12            A.    So for -- in KBR, we have business     10:21AM

           13       development and project development, and then     10:21AM

           14       we have actual projects.  If we have an           10:21AM

           15       actual project, once the project -- assuming      10:21AM

           16       the MFC project had moved forward, the people     10:21AM

           17       who are providing technical information would     10:21AM

           18       have documented their hours under an actual       10:21AM

           19       project code.  When we are developing             10:21AM

           20       business, it is under overhead numbers.  The      10:21AM

           21       overhead numbers are, we don't open separate      10:21AM

           22       numbers or separate projects.  So as an           10:21AM

           23       example, all of my time, all of John              10:21AM

           24       Derbyshire's time, all of Dennis Lippmann's       10:22AM

           25       time, all of the other Ammonia people, their      10:22AM

                                                                73

            2       times, their charged to one code.  My time        10:22AM

            3       would only go to one code.  For the last ten      10:22AM

            4       years that I've been with KBR, I have not         10:22AM

            5       charged my time to MFC or ExxonMobil or Sabay     10:22AM

            6       (phonetic) or Saudi Aramco.  It's been just       10:22AM

            7       one business development code.                    10:22AM

            8                  So, yes, we do charge to -- that       10:22AM

            9       is an overhead code, it's not charged to a        10:22AM

           10       client.  It's all overhead and then charged       10:22AM

           11       to KBR internally.  So, yes, we do have time      10:22AM

           12       sheets.  But those hours are, you know, not       10:22AM

           13       under an MFC charge code because the MFC          10:22AM

           14       project had not officially moved forward.         10:22AM

           15            Q.    And the MFC project would have         10:22AM

           16       officially moved forward when Notice to           10:22AM

           17       Proceed was delivered, right?                     10:22AM

           18            A.    In technology, yes.                    10:22AM

           19            Q.    Okay.  And technology is your          10:22AM

           21            A.    Correct.                               10:22AM

            6            Q.    And now if you were to go back         10:23AM

           10       spoken about, if you did a search, if you         10:23AM

           11       searched, say, MFC or Fatima or whatever it       10:23AM

           12       is, you would be able to come up with how         10:23AM

           13       much time you actually spent developing this      10:23AM

           14       business for KBR, right?                          10:23AM

           15            A.    I don't believe we could come up       10:23AM

           16       with how much time we spent.  As an example,      10:23AM

           17       you know, if the CEO of Fatima called up John     10:23AM

           18       Derbyshire, our president, to have a              10:23AM

           19       conversation and there were multiple              10:23AM

           20       conversations, John would not document, you       10:23AM

           22       Mr. Mukhtar or that he took 30 minutes to         10:24AM

           23       talk to me, to update me, or that he wrote an     10:24AM

           24       email, those kinds of things don't get            10:24AM

           25       documented.  What we know is that from about      10:24AM

            2       May of 2012 'til November of 2013, we had         10:24AM

            3       many different people, several levels of the      10:24AM

            4       organization, from executive to sales to a        10:24AM

            5       PSL, product service line, proposals, working     10:24AM

            6       on -- with MFC on these projects.  We had         10:24AM

            7       meetings in Dubai, you know, where we would,      10:24AM

            8       we would rent conference rooms for these          10:24AM

            9       meetings.  We had meetings in Houston.  We        10:24AM

           10       had meetings in, you know, at the site.  So       10:24AM

           11       there was a lot of time that was spent.  And      10:24AM

           12       we were doing it because, again, like I said,     10:24AM

           13       we wanted the project to move forward.            10:24AM

           14            Q.    And all this time and all these        10:24AM

           15       expenses and everything that you just talked      10:24AM

           16       about, all of this would be logged under this     10:24AM

           17       overhead code, right?                             10:25AM

           18            A.    Well, various overhead codes.  I'm     10:25AM

           19       not privy to where John Derbyshire codes his      10:25AM

           20       time.  I'm just here to tell you where -- you     10:25AM

           21       asked me about, you know, let's say my time.      10:25AM

           22       So my time goes -- like I mentioned, the last     10:25AM

           23       ten years that I've been in KBR, I've used        10:25AM

            2       that's been -- that's what's been given to us     10:25AM

            3       by our HR department and so that's what it        10:25AM

            4       is.                                               10:25AM

            5            Q.    Let's talk then solely from your       10:25AM

            6       perspective.  If you are logging your time        10:25AM

            7       under an overhead code, and it's got to do        10:25AM

            9       Fatima, relating to the project that you were     10:25AM

           10       developing, you would make a notation, talk       10:25AM

           11       to X, Y, Z from Fatima, right, or X, Y, Z         10:25AM

           12       from MFC, or something like that, you would       10:25AM

           13       add some description in your time log as to       10:25AM

           14       what you were doing, right?                       10:26AM

           15            A.    No.  Because we had -- let's say,      10:26AM

           16       I mean, to just give you an example, I mean,      10:26AM

           17       I could be having ten conversations with MFC      10:26AM

           18       in one day, which was not unusual when we         10:26AM

           19       were moving forward in these negotiations.        10:26AM

           20       It would be an extremely -- it would be an        10:26AM

           21       extreme waste of my time if I started noting      10:26AM

           22       and logging, and somebody at my level is not      10:26AM

           23       required to note every minute that I'm            10:26AM

           16       customers, right?                                 10:26AM

           17            A.    For all my customers.  You would       10:26AM

           18       not -- if I am traveling somewhere, you know,     10:26AM

           19       it would not -- my time would not be assigned     10:27AM

           20       to that customer.  It's a general overhead        10:27AM

           10       because we did not code anything by MFC.  So      10:27AM

           11       I could not pull it up by MFC.                    10:27AM

           12            Q.    Right.  And now, with respect to       10:27AM

           16            A.    For this project, I was the only       10:27AM

           17       one leading and essentially taking the deal       10:27AM

           18       forward.  I was the sales lead on this            10:28AM

            6       would be no way for them to actually sort out     10:28AM

           14       agreements were signed and possibly before        10:28AM

           15       the agreements were signed?                       10:28AM

           16            A.    Yeah.  There were several people       10:28AM

           17       in Dennis's team who were supporting the          10:28AM

           18       development of technical information such as      10:29AM

           19       project flow sheets, equipment information.       10:29AM

           20       Of course, we had -- our lawyers were             10:29AM

           21       involved, you know, people working, you know,     10:29AM

           22       on Gary's team.  So there were several other      10:29AM

           23       people who were involved in other tasks other     10:29AM

           24       than business development.                        10:29AM

            2       other than business development, what do you      10:29AM

            3       mean by that?                                     10:29AM

            4            A.    I mean technically, obviously,         10:29AM

            5       there is -- you know, so the technical team       10:29AM

            6       are the ones who are putting together or          10:29AM

            7       speaking with MFC's technical team members        10:29AM

           10       things like permitting.  Of course, then we       10:29AM

           11       had people involved form our finance team who     10:29AM

           12       were discussing things with Mr. Arif Dar          10:29AM

           13       relating to bonds.  We had people from our        10:29AM

           14       legal team who were involved in negotiating       10:29AM

           15       contracts.  That's what I mean by other           10:30AM

           16       people, other functions.                          10:30AM

           17            Q.    Okay.  So you had technical people     10:30AM

           18       who you say were preparing flow sheets and        10:30AM

           19       who were --                                       10:30AM

           24                  And these efforts were aimed           10:30AM

            9            Q.    Okay.  And no doubt we have copies     10:30AM

           10       of those proposals somewhere that were            10:30AM

           11       produced in the course of this litigation         10:30AM

           12       that were produced prior to or actually           10:30AM

           15            A.    Oh, absolutely.                        10:30AM

           17       there?                                            10:30AM

           18            A.    Absolutely.                            10:30AM

           19            Q.    Okay.  And the time that went into     10:30AM

           20       preparing these technical proposals was           10:30AM

           21       logged by the persons who prepared them,          10:30AM

           23            A.    I'm -- I assume so.                    10:31AM

            3       assume they did.                                  10:31AM

            4            Q.    Okay.  Why would you assume they       10:31AM

            5       did?                                              10:31AM

            6            A.    Well, you asked me if they would       10:31AM

            7       have logged their time.  Everybody in KBR has     10:31AM

            8       to log their time to something.  Whether          10:31AM

            9       it's, like I mentioned, a project code or an      10:31AM

           10       overhead code.  So I'm assuming they -- I         10:31AM

           11       mean, they would have to, not assuming, they      10:31AM

           12       would have to log time their to a code.           10:31AM

           14       you know what code they logged their time to      10:31AM

           13            Q.    Yeah.  You don't know that what        10:32AM

           14       that number is, right?                            10:32AM

           15            A.    I don't know that that number -- a     10:32AM

           16       number that has been documented, but like I       10:32AM

           17       said, not all the hours were documented.          10:32AM

           18            Q.    Right.                                 10:32AM

           19            A.    Like I said, if I'm picking up the     10:32AM

           20       phone, or if John Derbyshire is speaking with     10:32AM

           21       the CEO of Fatima, he is not logging that         10:32AM

           22       down.  If Dennis Lippmann is taking a call        10:32AM

           23       from an EPC contractor, which he did many         10:32AM

           24       times, he is not logging that time down.  So      10:32AM

            3       was spent at MFC, because in the course of a      10:32AM

           12       technical people, were they expected to log       10:33AM

           13       their time?                                       10:33AM

           14            A.    No.  Because at the time we were       10:33AM

           15       having these technical conversations, we had      10:33AM

           16       developed a very close working relationship       10:33AM

           12            hear what that last question was?            10:33AM

           13                  (Whereupon, the aforementioned         10:33AM

           14            question was read back by the Court          10:33AM

           16                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  So the answer       10:34AM

           17            is no, because at the time you were          10:34AM

           18            having those -- I'm not going to             10:34AM

           19            strike the answer, but -- and I think        10:34AM

           20            the response was a fair elaboration in       10:34AM

           21            response to your question.                   10:34AM

           22                  But if you can try and answer as       10:34AM

           23            directly as possible the questions,          10:34AM

           24            that's what's going to allow us to           10:35AM

           25            move forward.                                10:35AM

            2                  THE WITNESS:  Okay, I will.            10:35AM

            3            Thank you.                                   10:35AM

            4            Q.    Now, in the course of the              10:35AM

            5       gratuitous testimony you just provided, you       10:35AM

            6       mentioned that there were calls that came in      10:35AM

            7       from people like Mr. Uddin and Mr. Aslam,         10:35AM

            8       right, looking for information from KBR?          10:35AM

            9            A.    Yes.                                   10:35AM

           10            Q.    And KBR would tell them, you           10:35AM

           11       really shouldn't be calling this -- making        10:35AM

           12       these calls or asking for this information,       10:35AM

           13       because this is really stuff we ought to be       10:35AM

           14       charging you for, ever say that?                  10:35AM

           15            A.    No.                                    10:35AM

           16            Q.    And when you talk about work that      10:35AM

           17       was provided for MFC during the course of the     10:35AM

           18       relationship here, were there people other        10:35AM

           19       than technical people doing work for MFC?         10:35AM

           20            A.    KBR primarily has commercial and       10:35AM

           21       technical people only and then we have            10:36AM

           22       functions, as I mentioned, like legal and         10:36AM

           23       finance.  So in a project like this, we had       10:36AM

           24       people, technical, legal, finance, and            10:36AM

           25       commercial involved in the pursuit.               10:36AM

                                                                87

            2            Q.    Okay.  And the legal and               10:36AM

            3       commercial people and the finance people,         10:36AM

            4       right, were they also expected to log their       10:36AM

            5       time that they devoted to MFC issues?             10:36AM

            6            A.    No, they were not -- well, Bryan       10:36AM

            7       Blades, who was our attorney, he may have         10:36AM

            8       logged his time, for example, specifically,       10:36AM

            9       you know, when he traveled somewhere, he may      10:36AM

           10       have logged his time.  But I'm not sure.  The     10:36AM

           11       finance people, probably not.  Because if I       10:36AM

           12       may elaborate, your permission?                   10:36AM

           13            Q.    Yes, please.                           10:36AM

           14            A.    So the finance people and the          10:36AM

           15       legal people in KBR, generally, these support     10:36AM

           16       functions are at a level where they're not        10:36AM

           17       required -- they are not working on specific      10:37AM

           18       projects.  So we just feel that it's -- you       10:37AM

           19       know, it's these kind of at macro levels, at      10:37AM

           20       high levels in the organization, were not         10:37AM

           21       giving individual charge codes for every          10:37AM

           22       conversation that may come in during the day.     10:37AM

           23       It's considered routine business, if you          10:37AM

           24       will.                                             10:37AM

           25            Q.    Now, the legal people, the finance     10:37AM

            2       people, the commercial people, if they were       10:37AM

            3       logging their time, were they also putting it     10:37AM

            4       under this business -- or, I'm sorry, this        10:37AM

            5       overhead rubric or this overhead category?        10:37AM

            6            A.    I apologize, I don't know what --      10:37AM

            7       where they charged their time.  I just know       10:37AM

            8       that, you know, I would assume that there is      10:37AM

            9       an overhead function.  I don't know where         10:37AM

           10       they charged their time.                          10:37AM

           11            Q.    Okay.  And before you got here         10:37AM

           12       today, you never asked, right?                    10:37AM

           13            A.    No.                                    10:37AM

           14            Q.    Okay.  Now, you have experience,       10:37AM

           15       no doubt, as a business development               10:38AM

            6            A.    He was our Senior Vice President       10:38AM

            7       of commercial.  I reported to him during the      10:38AM

            8       time the MFC contract was being negotiated.       10:38AM

            9       He no longer works at KBR.                        10:38AM

           11            A.    I think 2017 or around that time.      10:38AM

           12       Maybe late 2017 or early, mid 2017.  I'm          10:38AM

           19            A.    No.                                    10:39AM

            8       then, did you consult with Mr. Centner            10:40AM

            9       regarding that potential or that actual           10:40AM

           10       project that KBR was undertaking with MFC?        10:40AM

           11            A.    Yes, on occasion.                      10:40AM

           12            Q.    Okay.  And what were those             10:41AM

           13       conversations about?                              10:41AM

           14            A.    Again, as I mentioned, the             10:41AM

           15       conversations would be around certain             10:41AM

           16       concessions that MFC would have liked.  They      10:41AM

           17       would be around discounts that MFC was            10:41AM

           18       requesting.  Those sorts of things.               10:41AM

           19            Q.    Okay.  And as you sit here today,      10:41AM

           20       you don't recall any specific conversations       10:41AM

           21       about concessions or discounts with               10:41AM

           22       Mr. Centner, right?                               10:41AM

           23            A.    Well, like I said, there were          10:41AM

           24       several conversations, but, you know, I -- if     10:41AM

           25       I see something, then, I may remember             10:41AM

           23            Q.    Okay.  So it was understood at         10:46AM

           24       that point that MFC had no money, right?          10:46AM

           25            A.    That's what it appears.                10:46AM

                                                                97

            2            Q.    The only source of MFC's potential     10:46AM

            3       funding would have been the completion of the     10:46AM

            4       financing, right?                                 10:46AM

            5            A.    Well, MFC had money.  I believe        10:46AM

            6       what is being referenced over here is MFC         10:47AM

            7       doesn't have the funds to achieve Financial       10:47AM

            8       Close or the Financial Close is not being         10:47AM

            9       pulled together.                                  10:47AM

           10            Q.    All right.  And you understand the     10:47AM

           11       concept of Financial Close, right?                10:47AM

           12            A.    I believe I do.                        10:47AM

           13            Q.    Okay.  And you also understand the     10:47AM

           14       concept of Notice to Proceed?                     10:47AM

           15            A.    Right.                                 10:47AM

           16            Q.    Okay.  Notice to Proceed happens       10:47AM

           17       at Financial Close or maybe soon thereafter,      10:47AM

           18       right?                                            10:47AM

           19            A.    Well, sometimes Notice to Proceed      10:47AM

           20       can happen before Financial Close.  We have       10:47AM

           21       had that happen in projects where owners have     10:47AM

           22       decided to move forward with their own            10:47AM

           23       injected equity to get a schedule advantage.      10:47AM

           24            Q.    All right.  But you have no reason     10:47AM

           25       to suspect that MFC would act in that way,        10:47AM

                                                                98

            2       right?                                            10:47AM

            3            A.    In this case, the way the contract     10:47AM

            4       was written, while MFC could have acted in        10:47AM

            5       that way, because those proceeded at owner's      10:47AM

            6       discretion.  It really depends on the owners,     10:47AM

            7       on when they want to give a Notice to             10:47AM

            8       Proceed.  There is no contractual language        10:47AM

            9       that say the Notice to Proceed has to occur       10:47AM

           10       by April 30th.  That's a backstop.  It could      10:47AM

           11       occur before.                                     10:48AM

           12            Q.    Well, if MFC had no money, then it     10:48AM

           13       would have to wait until Financial Close to       10:48AM

           14       get the money to do the project, right?           10:48AM

           15            A.    Well, they could have                  10:48AM

           16       authorized -- again, I'm not sure if you want     10:48AM

           17       me to elaborate on that answer or just give       10:48AM

           18       you a yes or no, but MFC did have money.          10:48AM

           19       They were spending money in other areas.  So      10:48AM

           20       they could have issued the Notice to Proceed      10:48AM

           21       for, if they wanted to move forward with a        10:48AM

           22       certain part of the project like other            10:48AM

           23       customers have done.                              10:48AM

           24            Q.    As far as you know, though, MFC        10:48AM

           25       didn't have $30 million with KBR, right?          10:48AM

                                                                99

            2            A.    The -- they would not have             10:48AM

            3       required $30 million to commence KBR's work.      10:48AM

            4       If you refer to the agreements that were          10:48AM

            5       signed, the vast majority of those payments       10:48AM

            6       were months down the road.  The only 10% --       10:48AM

            7       there's only 10% of the License Agreement         10:48AM

            8       that was due at NTP, a fraction of the            10:48AM

            9       Engineering Agreement and 10% of the              10:48AM

           10       Equipment Agreement.  Most of the -- the          10:48AM

           11       largest contract was for equipment, 27            10:48AM

           12       million.  Most of the equipment payments were     10:49AM

           13       deferred, several months down the road when       10:49AM

           14       equipment would start getting delivered.          10:49AM

           15            Q.    Right.  And if MFC decided to          10:49AM

           16       deliver Notice to Proceed before Financial        10:49AM

           17       Close, that would have been its decision,         10:49AM

           18       right?                                            10:49AM

           19            A.    Yes.                                   10:49AM

           20            Q.    Not KBR's decision?                    10:49AM

           21            A.    It's never KBR's decision.  It's       10:49AM

           22       always the client's decision.  The Notice to      10:49AM

           23       Proceed is issued by the client.                  10:49AM

           10            A.    He was the head of business            10:50AM

           11       development, the head of commercial, so he        10:50AM

           23       sentiment, that we should support TCM?            10:50AM

           24            A.    Yes.                                   10:50AM

            7            Q.    So KBR was willing to devote           10:50AM

           11            Q.    And that would have included           10:50AM

           12       providing information, technical support,         10:50AM

           13       etc., etc., not only to TCM, but to MFC as        10:50AM

           15            A.    So the whole context of this           10:51AM

           16       particular dialogue is that we were getting       10:51AM

           17       requests from MFC's team, specifically            10:51AM

           12            A.    Yes.  Specifically it had to do        10:52AM

           22            A.    Correct.                               10:52AM

           23            Q.    Okay.  But turning back to TCM,        10:52AM

           24       you said in that context you were getting         10:52AM

            3            A.    Yes.                                   10:52AM

            4            Q.    -- to provide support, for lack of     10:52AM

            5       a better word, right?                             10:52AM

            6            A.    Yes.                                   10:52AM

            7            Q.    And you and KBR decided to             10:52AM

            8       continue providing that information, right?       10:52AM

            9            A.    Yes.                                   10:52AM

           10            Q.    And you did that in part because       10:52AM

           11       you wanted to support potentially TCM, which      10:52AM

           12       was a KBR-approved contract?                      10:52AM

           13            A.    No.  We were doing it to support       10:52AM

           14       MFC.  So in fact as I mentioned, you know,        10:52AM

           15       the first amendment that we signed was with       10:52AM

           16       MFC, where MFC wanted us to revise the            10:53AM

           17       environmental permit guarantee.  This is          10:53AM

           18       right after we had -- a couple of --              10:53AM

           19       actually, April of 2014, after the                10:53AM

           20       engineering and license agreements were           10:53AM

           21       executed.  So that was to help MFC with their     10:53AM

           22       permit application because certain parameters     10:53AM

           23       had changed.  So we were working with MFC and     10:53AM

           24       we were working with Tecnimont.  It was in        10:53AM

           25       our interest and in MFC's interest to have        10:53AM

            7            Q.    So by supporting MFC, by               10:53AM

            8       supporting Tecnimont, you supported the           10:53AM

           10            A.    Sure.                                  10:53AM

           11            Q.    And it was in KBR's interest to        10:53AM

           12       have the project go forward?                      10:53AM

           13            A.    Absolutely.                            10:53AM

           14            Q.    Because KBR would have provided        10:53AM

           15       the technology to Tecnimont?                      10:53AM

           16            A.    We would have provided the             10:53AM

           17       technology to -- we had already signed a          10:53AM

           18       direct License Agreement with MFC.  We would      10:53AM

           19       always provide the technology to MFC.  And we     10:53AM

           20       had always made it very clear to MFC that the     10:53AM

           21       agreements that we had signed would be            10:54AM

           22       novated to any EPC that they are able to          10:54AM

            3       earlier, but Toyo, with Kawasaki.  But the        10:54AM

            4       agreements were directed between us and MFC,      10:54AM

            5       with the provision that they would be novated     10:54AM

            6       to the successful EPC.                            10:54AM

            7            Q.    Which would ultimately have            10:54AM

            8       resulted in KBR providing technology to TCM       10:54AM

            9       had the documents been novated, correct?          10:54AM

           10            A.    We would never have provided the       10:54AM

           11       technology to Tecnimont.  The technology is       10:54AM

           12       always provided to the end user.  The way the     10:54AM

           13       novation agreements work is that the              10:54AM

           14       contracts or the agreements are novated to        10:54AM

           15       the EPC contractor for the duration of the        10:54AM

           16       EPC for them to engineer the plant.  As soon      10:54AM

           17       as the plant is built and commissioned, the       10:54AM

           18       agreements are novated back to the end user,      10:54AM

           19       which, in this case, would always be MFC.         10:54AM

           20            Q.    Right.  Now, after you got this        10:54AM

           21       email, did you go back to Mr. Centner and         10:54AM

           23       money.  Did you do that?                          10:55AM

           24            A.    No.                                    10:55AM

           17            that's JX-16, the License Agreement?         10:59AM

           18                  MR. HELLER:  JX-16, yes --             10:59AM

           19            sorry, JX-16, Section 3.1, where it          10:59AM

           20            says, "KBR's obligation under this           10:59AM

           21            License Agreement shall not include          10:59AM

            2            went ahead and signed the separate           10:59AM

            3            contracts with MFC because it was not        10:59AM

            4            obligated to provide these services          10:59AM

            5            under the License Agreement, right?          10:59AM

            6            A.    We were not obligated to               10:59AM

            7       provide -- well, I mean, I can -- once the        11:00AM

            8       project is executed, or is in kickoff mode,       11:00AM

            9       whatever deliverables we provide under the        11:00AM

           10       Engineering Agreement, the Engineering            11:00AM

           11       Agreement includes intellectual property, it      11:00AM

           12       includes KBR's designs, our technology.           11:00AM

           13       That's -- the grants to use that technology       11:00AM

           14       is provided under the License Agreement.  So      11:00AM

           15       they are really linked.  There's really --        11:00AM

           16       you can't divorce one from the other.             11:00AM

           17            Q.    Right.  And when you say "kickoff      11:00AM

           18       mode," you mean Notice to Proceed, right?         11:00AM

           19            A.    Correct.                               11:00AM

           20            Q.    Okay.  And that's when KBR begins      11:00AM

           21       to provide these deliverables, under these        11:00AM

           22       contracts and not before, right?                  11:00AM

           23            A.    After Notice to Proceed is when we     11:00AM

           24       start to provide specific deliverables            11:00AM

           25       associated with the official, official scope      11:00AM

            2       of work under the engineering agreement.          11:00AM

            3       That's correct.                                   11:00AM

            4            Q.    Okay.  So if KBR was to provide as     11:00AM

            5       it did air permit applications support            11:00AM

            6       services and rezoning application support for     11:01AM

            7       MFC, it would have to do so under a separate      11:01AM

            8       agreement, right?                                 11:01AM

            9            A.    That had nothing to do with KBR        11:01AM

           10       technology.  That is something to do with the     11:01AM

           11       facility as a whole, where MFC was trying to      11:01AM

           12       develop not just an Ammonia plant, but all        11:01AM

           13       the downstream units, urea, granulation,          11:01AM

           14       diesel exhaust fluid and so forth.  So that       11:01AM

           15       had nothing to do with -- the Ammonia was one     11:01AM

           16       part of it, where we were providing source        11:01AM

           17       data, but we are not providing any                11:01AM

           18       technology-related designs.  We are not           11:01AM

           23       flow sheets.  None of that stuff.                 11:01AM

            4            Q.    All right.  So just recited a          11:02AM

            5       bunch of things that you're not providing --      11:02AM

            6       you were not providing to MFC, meaning you,       11:02AM

            7       the technical area, okay, flow sheets,            11:02AM

            8       technical support, etc., etc., there were a       11:02AM

            9       whole list of things that you said that KBR       11:02AM

           10       was not providing at this time to MFC, right?     11:02AM

           11            A.    We were not providing under the        11:02AM

           12       contracts that you asked me in provision 13       11:02AM

           13       or paragraph 13, we're not providing under        11:02AM

           14       those contracts.  But we had provided MFC a       11:02AM

           15       lot of that information to help MFC get the       11:02AM

           16       project to the point where we signed the          11:02AM

           17       Licensing and Engineering Agreements and          11:02AM

           18       Proprietary Equipment Agreements in November      11:02AM

           19       of 2013.  We had provided a lot of that           11:02AM

           20       information because until you have clearer        11:02AM

           21       definition on those things, you would not         11:02AM

           22       sign those agreements.  The agreements -- the     11:02AM

           23       body of the agreement may be 25, 30 pages,        11:02AM

           24       but to arrive at specific process guarantees      11:03AM

            5            Q.    Okay.  So that I understand your       11:03AM

            8            A.    Officially, yes.                       11:03AM

            9            Q.    Officially, right.  Before that,       11:03AM

           10       KBR would have done some work, right, to          11:03AM

           11       support MFC in the project, right?                11:03AM

           12            A.    Correct.                               11:03AM

           13            Q.    That work is not delivered under       11:03AM

           16            A.    That is not delivered as               11:03AM

           17       officially under those agreements.  However,      11:03AM

           18       we provided a lot of information to help MFC      11:03AM

           19       get better definition of the project.             11:04AM

           20            Q.    So when you say "officially," you      11:04AM

           21       mean pursuant to the terms of those               11:04AM

           16       Those become official deliverables for our        11:04AM

           17       project.  And those are the deliverables that     11:04AM

           18       MFC would then use to go out in the market,       11:04AM

           22       MFC would have been done either pursuant to a     11:06AM

           23       separate contract or as a matter of overhead      11:06AM

           24       or business development, right?                   11:06AM

           25            A.    It was done in the interest of         11:06AM

            3            Q.    And if an accounting was made of       11:06AM

            4       the efforts that KBR devoted in delivering        11:06AM

            5       these services, to the extent they were not       11:06AM

            6       covered under a different contract, those         11:06AM

            7       would have been put under the rubric of KBR's     11:06AM

            8       overhead; isn't that correct?                     11:06AM

            9            A.    So I can speak for myself and I        11:06AM

           10       can speak for a lot of other people who were      11:06AM

           11       involved in the project, that I'm aware,          11:06AM

           12       the -- their time is not allocated to             11:06AM

           13       specific projects.  And like I had used the       11:06AM

           14       example of some senior management.  There may     11:06AM

           15       be some people who may have worked on some        11:06AM

           16       specific tasks.  I'm really -- I mean, again,     11:07AM

           17       I said this before, this is an 18-month           11:07AM

           18       pursuant, so there may be some people with        11:07AM

           19       some specific charge codes, but the vast          11:07AM

           20       majority of people who were supporting it         11:07AM

           21       were business development or overhead people,     11:07AM

           22       personnel, whose times would be allocated to      11:07AM

           23       maybe one or two charge codes.                    11:07AM

           24            Q.    Which were all overhead charge         11:07AM

           25       codes, right?                                     11:07AM

           17            Q.    Okay.  Mr. Ahmad, if you will turn     11:25AM

           19       paragraph 14.  Now, you state here that KBR       11:25AM

           20       also helped -- toward the end of the              11:26AM

            3            Q.    All right.  And Tecnimont we           11:26AM

            4       already discussed in the context of               11:26AM

            5       Mr. Centner's email, right?                       11:26AM

            6            A.    Yes.                                   11:26AM

            7            Q.    Okay.  Isn't it true that              11:26AM

            8       Tecnimont had a preexisting relationships         11:26AM

            9       with Toyo and Kawasaki?                           11:26AM

           10            A.    I'm not aware of Tecnimont's           11:26AM

           11       preexisting relationship with Toyo.               11:26AM

           12            Q.    But you are aware of its existing      11:26AM

           13       relationship with Kawasaki, right?                11:26AM

           15       relationship either.  I believe Kawasaki may      11:26AM

           16       have helped Fatima with relocation of an          11:26AM

           17       asset from Europe to Pakistan, but I'm not        11:27AM

           20            Q.    All right.  So when you say that       11:27AM

           21       MFC helped KBR -- I'm sorry, KBR helped MFC       11:27AM

            4       possible -- the possibility of that               11:27AM

            6            A.    Yes.                                   11:27AM

            7            Q.    Okay.  Did you -- when you did         11:27AM

            8       this -- strike that.                              11:27AM

            9                  By the way, who at KBR made these      11:27AM

           10       introductions, was it you?                        11:27AM

           11            A.    The introductions for Tecnimont        11:27AM

           12       would probably have been made with -- through     11:27AM

           13       Charles Centner or maybe John Derbyshire, who     11:27AM

           14       is the president of technology.  Same with        11:27AM

           15       Toyo, because they manage the executive           11:27AM

           16       relationship with Toyo.  But Kawasaki, I'm        11:28AM

           17       not aware.                                        11:28AM

           18            Q.    It wasn't you who made that            11:28AM

           19       introduction with Kawasaki, was it?               11:28AM

           20            A.    No.                                    11:28AM

           21            Q.    It was some other person at KBR?       11:28AM

           22            A.    Possibly, yes.                         11:28AM

           23            Q.    Right.  So this statement, this        11:28AM

           24       whole sentence then, is not based on your         11:28AM

            3       not based on personal knowledge, I can speak      11:28AM

            4       for Kawasaki.  But for Toyo and Tecnimont, I      11:28AM

            5       am aware that we did make introductions.          11:28AM

            6            Q.    Okay.  So you personally did not       11:28AM

            7       make these introductions, right?                  11:28AM

            9            Q.    It would been someone else at KBR,     11:28AM

           10       whether it be Derbyshire or Centner, right?       11:28AM

           11            A.    Correct.                               11:28AM

           12            Q.    Okay.  And the way you would have      11:28AM

           13       found about this is by talking to either          11:28AM

           14       Derbyshire or Centner about these                 11:28AM

           15       introductions, right?                             11:28AM

           16            A.    Or by having a lot of the usual        11:28AM

           17       interaction that we had with the Toyo and --      11:28AM

           18       Toyos and Tecnimonts on the phone and once        11:29AM

           19       they start developing their own                   11:29AM

           20       specifications for the project.  Because at       11:29AM

           21       that time, they would need a lot of               11:29AM

           22       information support from us, which we were        11:29AM

           23       providing.                                        11:29AM

           11            A.    I said that in response to your        11:29AM

           12       earlier question when you asked me that you       11:29AM

           13       would have -- they would have called you and      11:29AM

           14       told you that had Centner or John told me         11:29AM

           15       they had connected.  What I was saying, they      11:29AM

           16       would not have to tell me, you would hear         11:29AM

           17       about it once they make the introductions,        11:29AM

           22       said in your testimony before.  I'm referring     11:29AM

           23       you specifically to paragraph 14 of your          11:30AM

           24       statement.  You say that "KBR also helped MFC     11:30AM

            3            A.    KBR did.                               11:30AM

            4            Q.    That's right.  KBR did.  But you       11:30AM

            5       personally did nothing?                           11:30AM

            6            A.    Correct.                               11:30AM

            7            Q.    And you found out about this           11:30AM

            8       through conversations with others, right?         11:30AM

            9            A.    Correct.                               11:30AM

           10            Q.    Okay.  And this would have been        11:30AM

           11       either Mr. Derbyshire or Mr. Centner, right?      11:30AM

           12            A.    No.  As I said earlier, it could       11:30AM

           13       be from the EPC's themselves.  I don't            11:30AM

           14       remember -- this was seven, eight years ago.      11:30AM

           15       I don't remember exactly how I found out the      11:30AM

           16       connection had been made, but once the            11:30AM

           17       connection is made, then we are working           11:30AM

           18       collaboratively with the EPCs to develop          11:30AM

           19       things and take things forward.                   11:30AM

           20            Q.    Okay.  So -- but you would agree,      11:30AM

           21       then, that this statement is not saying that      11:30AM

           22       you personally had made the connection            11:30AM

           23       between MFC and these various contractors?        11:30AM

           24            A.    So I'm saying the statement reads      11:31AM

           25       KBR helped MFC connect.  It does not read I.      11:31AM

            2       So, yes.  I don't -- as I've said a couple of     11:31AM

            3       times, I don't recall making those                11:31AM

            4       connections or those introductions myself         11:31AM

            5       personally.                                       11:31AM

            6            Q.    Right.  And so to make this            11:31AM

            7       statement comport with what we would expect       11:31AM

            8       in a Witness Statement, you would -- you          11:31AM

            9       should have said, would you not, would you        11:31AM

           10       agree, that I learned that KBR had made           11:31AM

           11       connections to an IFC, these contractors          11:31AM

           12       after having spoken to these contractors, or      11:31AM

           13       John Derbyshire, potentially, or through the      11:31AM

           14       records of KBR.  That's what you should have      11:31AM

           15       said, right?                                      11:31AM

           16            A.    The way the statement is written I     11:32AM

           17       believe reflects the way it happens, which is     11:32AM

           18       that KBR helped MFC connect with EPC              11:32AM

           19       contractors.  So I don't believe this             11:32AM

           20       current -- the way the statement is written       11:32AM

           21       at the moment is inaccurate.                      11:32AM

           22            Q.    I'm not saying it's inaccurate.        11:32AM

           23       My question to you, and you have already          11:32AM

           24       answered as far as I'm concerned, is that         11:32AM

           16       don't know, really, whether or not Fatima had     11:32AM

           17       previous relationships with Toyo, Tecnimont       11:32AM

           20            A.    To my knowledge, Tecnimont has not     11:33AM

           10       disagree, standard industry practice is to        11:35AM

           11       have the payment stream kick in upon signing      11:35AM

           12       of the document, right?                           11:35AM

           14            Q.    What do you mean by "award"?           11:35AM

           15            A.    When the documents are signed,         11:35AM

           16       usually the agreements become effective and       11:35AM

           17       that's when payments kick in.  That's the --      11:35AM

           18       I would say in the vast majority of cases,        11:35AM

           19       that's how it happens.  Because at that time,     11:35AM

           20       when clients sign these agreements, a lot of      11:35AM

           21       other things that are needed to take the          11:35AM

           22       project forward are in place.  Either that or     11:35AM

           23       they want to get the agreements signed ahead      11:35AM

           24       of time and gain a head start on the EPC          11:35AM

            2            Q.    Right.  So I think you gave us two     11:35AM

            3       alternatives, either it kicks in at award or      11:35AM

            4       it kicks in at NTP, right?                        11:35AM

            5            A.    That's right.                          11:35AM

            6            Q.    And both of those are standard         11:35AM

            7       industry practice?                                11:35AM

            8            A.    Well, they can be.  It depends on      11:35AM

            9       what stage the customer is in their               11:35AM

           10       financing.  But, yes, they could be.              11:35AM

           11            Q.    Right.  So you will concede, then,     11:35AM

           12       that Notice to Proceed as the trigger for the     11:35AM

           13       payments could also be standard industry          11:36AM

           14       practice, right?                                  11:36AM

           15            A.    It varies project to project.  But     11:36AM

           16       in a project where finance is tied to Notice      11:36AM

           17       to Proceed, it could be.                          11:36AM

           18            Q.    Okay.  And that's the way it           11:36AM

           19       happened here, right, with respect to the         11:36AM

           20       License Agreement?                                11:36AM

           21            A.    That's the way it was written.         11:36AM

           22            Q.    Right.                                 11:36AM

           23            A.    In 11.3.                               11:36AM

           24            Q.    Which was not a break from             11:36AM

           25       standard industry practice?                       11:36AM

            2            A.    It was not a break from industry       11:36AM

            3       practice for a project that does not have         11:36AM

            4       finance lined up yet.                             11:36AM

            5            Q.    And this project did not have          11:36AM

            6       finance lined up yet, right?                      11:36AM

            7            A.    That's right.                          11:36AM

            8            Q.    Let's get to paragraph 18.  I will     11:36AM

            9       quote.  "By executing the Ammonia Contracts       11:36AM

           10       before MFC issued a NTP, MFC could leverage       11:36AM

           11       those contracts to get financial close, and       11:37AM

           12       also get work from KBR without having to pay.     11:37AM

           13       Although" -- and I will stop there for a          11:37AM

           14       moment.  I'm a little confused here, because      11:37AM

           15       you say that "By executing the Ammonia            11:37AM

           16       Contracts before MFC issued a NTP," what did      11:37AM

           17       you mean by that?                                 11:37AM

           18            A.    Well, what I mean by that is by        11:37AM

           19       signing the Ammonia engineering or the            11:37AM

           20       Ammonia License Engineering and Proprietary       11:37AM

           21       Equipment Agreements before issuing an NTP.       11:37AM

           22       That's what I mean.                               11:37AM

           23            Q.    Would you expect that MFC would be     11:37AM

           24       able to issue an NTP before signing the           11:37AM

           25       agreements?                                       11:37AM

                                                               128

            2            A.    No.                                    11:37AM

            3            Q.    So I'm a little confused.  Do you      11:37AM

            4       want to elaborate on what you were trying to      11:37AM

            5       say here?  "By executing the Ammonia              11:37AM

            6       Contracts before MFC issued a NTP," is there      11:37AM

            7       a realm of possibility in which MFC could         11:38AM

            8       have issued an NTP before signing these           11:38AM

            9       contracts?                                        11:38AM

           10            A.    Well, MFC could -- and this is         11:38AM

           11       something that we also do very routinely, you     11:38AM

           12       know, we could commence work under what we        11:38AM

           13       call an early works agreement and provide MFC     11:38AM

           14       with a lot of the deliverables that they were     11:38AM

           15       asking, which would be a paid exercise, and       11:38AM

           16       provide MFC with a lot of the deliverables        11:38AM

           17       that they were asking us to provide before        11:38AM

           18       the contracts were signed.  What I'm              11:38AM

           19       referring to over here is that usually, as I      11:38AM

           20       mentioned earlier, if you sign a contract and     11:38AM

           21       you have an enforceable effective contract,       11:38AM

           22       at that time, you don't need an NTP.  That        11:38AM

           23       means the work is kicked off.                     11:38AM

           24                  In this case, MFC was very keen to     11:38AM

           25       sign the agreements with KBR, but not give an     11:38AM

                                                               129

            2       NTP, so that they could go to market and          11:38AM

            3       demonstrate that they had signed contracts        11:38AM

            4       with KBR for Ammonia licensing.  In fact,         11:38AM

            5       those contracts would also reference, I           11:39AM

            6       believe in their bond filings, subsequently.      11:39AM

            7            Q.    All right.  So at least under the      11:39AM

            8       terms of the negotiations that you were           11:39AM

            9       having with KBR, I'm sorry, with MFC at this      11:39AM

           10       time, you meaning KBR, KBR was told by MFC        11:39AM

           11       that MFC would not be issuing Notice to           11:39AM

           12       Proceed before it signed these contracts,         11:39AM

           13       right?  You understood that?                      11:39AM

           14            A.    Well, the NTP provision was            11:39AM

           15       introduced around May of 2013 or June of          11:39AM

           16       2013.  The intent before that, because MFC        11:39AM

           17       was very keen to actually sign the agreements     11:39AM

           18       in June.  In fact, I believe that at one          11:39AM

           19       point MFC's Mr. Ahsen Uddin even said, you        11:39AM

           20       know, there was no talk of deferrals, there       11:39AM

           21       was just talks of a discount.  And they were      11:39AM

           22       saying they were ready to sign the agreements     11:39AM

           23       in June of 2013.  Once MFC realized that the      11:40AM

           24       Financial Close would be pushed out, they         11:40AM

           25       told us that, you know, we are not going to       11:40AM

                                                               130

            2       be able to commence the work officially under     11:40AM

            3       the agreements until much later.  And that's      11:40AM

            4       when we introduced the NTP language.  So the      11:40AM

            5       NTP language was then produced around June        11:40AM

            6       2013.                                             11:40AM

            7            Q.    Who introduced the NTP language?       11:40AM

            8            A.    I did.                                 11:40AM

            9            Q.    It was your idea to put NTP in         11:40AM

           10       there?                                            11:40AM

           11            A.    After consultation with Mr. Ahsen      11:40AM

           12       Uddin.                                            11:40AM

           13            Q.    And then didn't Mr. Uddin tell you     11:40AM

           14       that there is no way that MFC is going to         11:40AM

           15       agree to sign these documents unless the NTP      11:40AM

           16       trigger was put in?                               11:40AM

           17            A.    Mr. Ahsen Uddin was very insistent     11:40AM

           18       that, you know, we sign the agreements as         11:40AM

           19       soon as possible.  In fact, there were some       11:40AM

           20       discussions where Mr. Ahsen Uddin wanted the      11:40AM

           21       agreements to be signed in June of 2013.          11:40AM

           22            Q.    But at the same time, he told you      11:40AM

           23       that MFC could not agree to have these            11:40AM

           24       documents go effective until NTP, right?          11:41AM

           25            A.    What he told me is that they could     11:41AM

                                                               131



            1                      CROSS - A. AHMAD

            2       not agree to -- like I said, we have payments     11:41AM

            3       that were tied to effective date of contract,     11:41AM

            4       which is the date of signing.  So what he         11:41AM

            5       told us is that he could not have that            11:41AM

            6       language in there because they had not            11:41AM

            7       reached Financial Close.  At the same time,       11:41AM

            8       they wanted the agreements, because they          11:41AM

            9       wanted to show that agreements had been           11:41AM

           10       signed and it was being used for raising, you     11:41AM

           11       know, being used with their other investors       11:41AM

           12       or other entities or, you know, financial         11:41AM

           13       institutions.  So they wanted the agreement       11:41AM

           14       signed and the way to overcome that hurdle of     11:41AM

           15       not paying the 10% license due upon               11:41AM

           16       effectiveness was to introduce the NTP clause     11:41AM

           17       in there.                                         11:41AM

           18            Q.    And Mr. Uddin told you that that       11:41AM

           19       was MFC's preference, to have the NTP clause      11:41AM

           20       in there; isn't that correct?                     11:41AM

           21            A.    We discussed it, Mr. Uddin and I.      11:41AM

           22       We were working very closely together.  He        11:41AM

           23       was MFC's lead negotiator.  We would have         11:41AM

           24       several conversations, maybe in a day.  And       11:42AM

           25       it was our joint understanding that that's        11:42AM

                                                               132

            2       how we could overcome that hurdle and have        11:42AM

            3       MFC get a signed contract.                        11:42AM

            4            Q.    Right.  And Mr. Uddin told you         11:42AM

            5       that he preferred to have these payments,         11:42AM

            6       whatever it is that was due under these           11:42AM

            7       documents, to be effective as of NTP, right?      11:42AM

            8            A.    Yes.                                   11:42AM

            9            Q.    Okay.  And what you also say is        11:42AM

           10       that MFC could leverage those contracts to        11:42AM

           11       get Financial Close, right?                       11:42AM

           12            A.    Um-hum.                                11:42AM

           13            Q.    Okay.  That's something KBR knew,      11:42AM

           14       right?                                            11:42AM

           15            A.    Yes.                                   11:42AM

           16            Q.    And it was in KBR's interests that     11:42AM

           17       MFC do that, right?                               11:42AM

           18            A.    Right.  MFC discussed that with us     11:42AM

           19       many times.  And we were okay with that,          11:42AM

           20       because we wanted the project to proceed.         11:42AM

           21            Q.    Right.  And so there was nothing       11:42AM

           22       wrong with MFC leveraging these contracts to      11:42AM

           23       get Financial Close, right?                       11:42AM

           24            A.    There was nothing wrong as far as      11:43AM

           25       MFC leveraging the contracts.  Of course, you     11:43AM

                                                               133

            2       know, we did have a concern that if MFC were      11:43AM

            3       to change direction that we had a                 11:43AM

            4       reputational risk at stake.                       11:43AM

            5            Q.    That wasn't my question, though,       11:43AM

            6       right?                                            11:43AM

            7                  So my question is, there is            11:43AM

            8       clearly nothing wrong and you can say --          11:43AM

            9       well, strike that.                                11:43AM

           10                  There is clearly nothing wrong         11:43AM

           11       with them using these contracts to leverage,      11:43AM

           12       as leverage with its potential lenders,           11:43AM

           13       right?                                            11:43AM

           14            A.    Insofar as they are not having         11:43AM

           15       private discussions with our competitor.          11:43AM

           16            Q.    Well, that's not the issue.            11:43AM

           17                  The question is, taking these          11:43AM

           18       contracts and using them as leverage to gain      11:43AM

           19       Financial Close, that's your language here,       11:43AM

           20       there is nothing wrong with that, right?          11:43AM

           21            A.    I will, again, respectfully            11:43AM

           22       restate that as far as they are having and        11:43AM

           23       they are telling us they are only having          11:43AM

           24       conversations with us, which is our               11:43AM

            3       wrong with that.                                  11:44AM

            4            Q.    And, in fact, using the contracts      11:44AM

            5       to gain leverage to get Financial Close would     11:44AM

            6       benefit KBR, right?                               11:44AM

            7            A.    It would benefit the project.          11:44AM

            8            Q.    And benefiting the project would       11:44AM

            9       benefit KBR?                                      11:44AM

           10            A.    Benefits KBR and everybody else,       11:44AM

           11       because the project moves forward.                11:44AM

           12            Q.    Okay.  It clearly would benefit        11:44AM

           13       KBR?  Yes?                                        11:44AM

           14            A.    Yes.                                   11:44AM

            9       are people at KBR who do, who are familiar        11:45AM

           12            A.    Correct.                               11:45AM

           13            Q.    And these were people that you no      11:45AM

           14       doubt consulted to find out information about     11:45AM

           15       that, right?                                      11:45AM

           16            A.    No, we did not get into a lot of       11:45AM

           17       details with -- on that side.  There was a        11:45AM

           18       time when MFC requested KBR's assistance back     11:45AM

           19       in June 2013 or May 2013 when they were           11:45AM

           20       looking at -- like I said, MFC was very new       11:45AM

           21       to this market, they wanted some                  11:45AM

           22       understanding of how to, you know, vet            11:45AM

           23       financial consultants.  They wanted us to         11:46AM

           24       introduce them to lenders.  We introduced         11:46AM

           25       them to our development group, a gentleman, I     11:46AM

            3       believe he is with KBR anymore.                   11:46AM

            4                  At one point, MFC also asked KBR       11:46AM

            5       if we would be interested in becoming an          11:46AM

            6       equity partner in the project.  So those          11:46AM

            7       conversations happened with somebody else,        11:46AM

            8       but they really were for a very limited           11:46AM

            9       period of time.                                   11:46AM

           10            Q.    Okay.  So you did have such            11:46AM

           11       conversations, right?                             11:46AM

           12            A.    I made the introductions.  I was       11:46AM

           13       not involved in them.                             11:46AM

           14            Q.    Okay.  And were you aware that the     11:46AM

           15       need for MFC to leverage contracts was            11:46AM

           16       something that the lenders expected in order      11:46AM

           17       to move the financing along?                      11:46AM

           18            A.    What the lenders really needed was     11:47AM

           19       a firm EPC price.  And, of course, a              11:47AM

           20       precursor to getting a firm EPC price was to      11:47AM

           21       align with a licensor on the basis of whom --     11:47AM

           22       of whose technology a firm EPC number could       11:47AM

           23       be developed.  So I think -- I believe the        11:47AM

           24       lenders were aware, as I believe KBR's name       11:47AM

           25       brought credibility to the project by having      11:47AM

            2       it referenced.  The thing that is of most         11:47AM

            3       interest to lenders is to have a firm and         11:47AM

            4       binding LSTK turnkey number that is bankable.     11:47AM

            5            Q.    And lenders would also, prior to       11:47AM

            6       that point and in moving the project along,       11:47AM

            7       would expect to see technology licenses           11:47AM

            8       signed and, for lack of a better word,            11:47AM

            9       leveraged, right?                                 11:47AM

           10            A.    I don't believe they would             11:47AM

           11       necessarily want to see them leveraged.  They     11:47AM

           12       would have to have them signed, because, as I     11:47AM

           13       mentioned earlier, if you don't have the          11:48AM

           14       technology, the only way to get a binding EPC     11:48AM

           15       price, which is what the lenders are              11:48AM

           16       interested in, because their concern is, is       11:48AM

           17       the price going to be, you know, 2.5 billion      11:48AM

           18       or 2.2 billion.  The only way to get a            11:48AM

           19       binding number is if it's based on a              11:48AM

           20       licensor's technology.  That's what is of         11:48AM

           21       most interest to the lenders.                     11:48AM

           22            Q.    Okay.  And before you get there,       11:48AM

           23       you need -- or at least MFC would need a          11:48AM

           24       Technology License?                               11:48AM

           23            A.    Yes.                                   11:50AM

           24            Q.    Okay.  Have you finished looking       11:50AM

           25       it over?                                          11:50AM

            3            Q.    Okay.  I'm sorry.                      11:50AM

            4                  Now, who is Bryan Blades?              11:50AM

            5            A.    Bryan is our lead attorney on this     11:50AM

            6       project.                                          11:50AM

            7            Q.    Okay.  So it's fair to say that        11:50AM

            8       this document was a communication from your       11:50AM

            9       lead attorney on this project providing legal     11:50AM

           10       advice to KBR, right?                             11:50AM

           11            A.    I believe this is a status report      11:50AM

           12       on the negotiations that took place that          11:50AM

           13       particular day.                                   11:50AM

           14            Q.    So you don't believe that this was     11:51AM

           15       a document providing legal advice to KBR and      11:51AM

           16       personnel, right?                                 11:51AM

           17            A.    I believe this is amongst,             11:51AM

           18       perhaps, other things.  There is a legal          11:51AM

           19       component to it, but there is -- you know,        11:51AM

           20       primarily it's commercial and legal both.         11:51AM

           21            Q.    Okay.  So Mr. Blades was acting        11:51AM

           22       both in a legal and a commercial capacity,        11:51AM

           23       right?                                            11:51AM

           24            A.    No, he was not acting in both a        11:51AM

           25       legal and commercial capacity.  As is very        11:51AM

            5       several hours and into late evening, one          11:51AM

            6       member of the team, you know, summarizes the      11:51AM

            7       status to our management.  So he is not           11:51AM

           12            Q.    Okay.  So it's fair to say, then,      11:52AM

           13       Mr. Blades was the last man standing here and     11:52AM

           14       he was the one who was supposed to report?        11:52AM

           15            A.    It appears so, yeah.                   11:52AM

           16            Q.    All right.  And let me turn your       11:52AM

           17       attention to the middle of the document where     11:52AM

           18       it discusses Notice to Proceed.  And it says,     11:52AM

           19       "The 'Notice to Proceed' hard stop...date,        11:52AM

           20       which KBR had initially proposed to be set at     11:52AM

           21       January 31, 2014, was extended to March 31,       11:52AM

           14                  So the client's insistence was of      11:53AM

           18       extension, the client committed to paying a       11:53AM

           19       convenience termination fee (payable for any      11:53AM

           20       reason other than failure of financing) of        11:53AM

           21       some percentage of the license fee; the           11:53AM

           22       current KBR proposal is that the client pay       11:53AM

           23       50% of the license fee for such termination."     11:53AM

           13            A.    No, it's not to penalize MFC at        11:53AM

           14       all.  It's to compensate KBR for the effort       11:53AM

           15       that we had invested over several months to       11:54AM

           16       bring MFC's project to this point and for MFC     11:54AM

           17       to essentially use KBR's name to help it take     11:54AM

           22            Q.    Well, it says right here, "We          11:54AM

            3            A.    I think just he probably, you          11:54AM

            4       know, did misspeak.  Because in the first         11:54AM

            6       termination fee."  So I think he is referring     11:54AM

            7       to a termination for convenience fee in the       11:54AM

            8       first sentence, but calling it, you know, a       11:54AM

           11       compensate KBR for the goodwill and good          11:55AM

           12       faith that we had invested over the past          11:55AM

           13       several months.                                   11:55AM

           14            Q.    So you never called Mr. Blades out     11:55AM

           15       on this, you didn't correct him at any point      11:56AM

           16       in time, right?                                   11:56AM

           17            A.    Not to my recollection.  On this       11:56AM

           18       particular memo, I can't remember.                11:56AM

           19            Q.    All right.  And there is no memo       11:56AM

           20       in response to Mr. Blades that, you know, you     11:56AM

           21       really should be careful, it's not a penalty,     11:56AM

           22       it's really compensation for MFC, right?          11:56AM

           23            A.    Yeah.  I mean, are you -- if you       11:56AM

           24       are asking for this particular memo, I don't      11:56AM

            2            Q.    Okay.  So all in all, then, your       11:56AM

            3       position is that it's wrong to call the           11:56AM

            4       termination fee a penalty, right?                 11:56AM

            5            A.    I have seen this referred to as        11:56AM

            6       penalty, as compensation, as a fee, as            11:56AM

            7       inconsequential.  I believe, you know, in the     11:56AM

            8       course of a long, drawn out negotiation, you      11:56AM

            9       know, various parties and various people          11:56AM

           10       referred it as different things.  It was --       11:56AM

           11       the sole purpose was to compensate KBR for        11:57AM

           12       our efforts.  And this is something that was      11:57AM

           13       acknowledged by MFC.  I was in the meeting        11:57AM

           14       when it happened.                                 11:57AM

           15            Q.    And given that understanding, you      11:57AM

           16       would never call this to be a penalty, right?     11:57AM

           17            A.    I might have.  Like I said, you        11:57AM

           18       know, I mean, over the course of several          11:57AM

           19       months, you know, this particular termination     11:57AM

           20       for convenience fee was referred by different     11:57AM

           21       names.  I mean, I think, you know, just in        11:57AM

           22       shorthand, I believe, you know, when people       11:57AM

           23       are thinking of payment that has to be made,      11:57AM

           24       you know, in that context, you know, payment      11:57AM

           25       that has to be made, whether it's a               11:57AM

            2       compensation or anything is, you know,            11:57AM

            3       perhaps in our mind, you know, the word that      11:57AM

            4       comes is penalty.                                 11:57AM

            5            Q.    So you are saying that when you        11:57AM

            6       think of compensation the other side suffers      11:58AM

            7       a penalty?                                        11:58AM

            8            A.    I didn't say that at all.  I said      11:58AM

            9       in this particular context, because we are        11:58AM

           10       talking for a termination for convenience, we     11:58AM

           11       are talking about termination, perhaps, you       11:58AM

           12       know, that word comes out more readily when       11:58AM

           13       people are just typing emails.                    11:58AM

           14            Q.    So if you heard anyone or came to      11:58AM

           15       the attention, your attention of anyone at        11:58AM

           16       MFC using that shorthand of a penalty, would      11:58AM

           17       you have corrected them?                          11:58AM

           18            A.    I can't -- I would have to hear        11:58AM

           19       what context they were saying it.                 11:58AM

           20            Q.    Well, it was KBR's position, at        11:58AM

           21       least according to this exhibit, that this        11:58AM

           22       fee was to, and I will quote, "to penalize        11:58AM

           23       the client should it attempt to work with a       11:59AM

           24       competitor to KBR."                               11:59AM

            2       anything you want, they have to pay a fee if      11:59AM

            3       they go with a competitor.  Okay?  They have      11:59AM

            4       to pay -- call it compensation.  If they go       11:59AM

            5       to a competitor, etc., etc.  What this really     11:59AM

            6       was was to disincentivize the client from         11:59AM

            7       going to a competitor, right?                     11:59AM

            8            A.    This was to -- MFC was free to go      11:59AM

            9       to anybody they chose to go to.  We never         11:59AM

           10       asked MFC for exclusivity.  However, because      11:59AM

           11       of the time and effort that we had invested       11:59AM

           12       with MFC, we asked, and it was discussed and      11:59AM

           13       MFC fully understood why we inserted 11.4 in      11:59AM

           14       there.  It was not to penalize them, it was       11:59AM

           15       only to compensate KBR, because the amount of     11:59AM

           16       effort that went from KBR in this particular      11:59AM

           17       project was not usual.                            11:59AM

           18            Q.    All right.  And all of this effort     11:59AM

           19       that you're talking about would have been         12:00PM

            2            Q.    And that's what you're talking         12:01PM

            3       about here, that MFC -- that MFC needed to        12:01PM

            4       compensate KBR for?                               12:01PM

            5            A.    It's not just that.  It's also the     12:01PM

            6       reputational risk.  We had our name on bond       12:01PM

            7       filings.  I will give you a very specific         12:01PM

            8       example.  MFC came to us after the agreements     12:01PM

            9       were signed and they needed our support to        12:01PM

           10       show that the ex -- the life expectancy of        12:01PM

           11       this plant will be over 25 years.  That           12:01PM

           12       specific request went under KBR letterhead.       12:01PM

           13       It was our name that went on the letter that      12:01PM

           14       went to the bond counsel to demonstrate to        12:01PM

           15       the bond counsel, on the basis of which MFC       12:01PM

           16       got their bond extension, that the plant          12:01PM

           17       would have a life expectancy of over              12:01PM

           18       25 years.                                         12:01PM

           19                  So there is clearly the direct         12:01PM

           20       effort, but for a leading Ammonia licensor        12:02PM

           21       like KBR, the reputational risk far exceeds       12:02PM

           22       correct.  However, several other -- like I        12:03PM

            5            A.    It was not required -- we were not     12:03PM

            6       required to provide anything.  We were doing      12:03PM

            7       everything to help our clients take the           12:03PM

            8       project forward, with some mutual                 12:03PM

           16       this, these services that you delivered to        12:03PM

           17       help your client before NTP, these were           12:03PM

           18       services that became accounted for at KBR as      12:03PM

           19       overhead, right?                                  12:04PM

           20            A.    For a lot of people, yes, they         12:04PM

           21       would be.  I mean, as I gave you some             12:04PM

           22       specific examples, you know, if I am              12:04PM

           18       am aware of.  Because we are an engineering       12:04PM

            3            Q.    And it's your recollection that        12:05PM

            4       the services that were provided by KBR to MFC     12:05PM

            5       were not being logged to a client-specific        12:05PM

            6       charge code; isn't that correct?                  12:05PM

            7            A.    So, you know, I think for -- I         12:05PM

            8       believe for the work that we had official         12:05PM

            9       contracts for, you know, you mentioned -- I       12:05PM

           10       think in Exhibit maybe 12 or 13, the two          12:05PM

           11       contracts where we helped MFC with                12:05PM

           12       environment permitting, we would have logged      12:05PM

           13       those to a specific charge code and we would      12:05PM

           14       have provided those time sheets to MFC.           12:05PM

           15       Similar for -- same for the TSA that our ENC      12:05PM

           16       groups sign.  Because in that -- in those         12:05PM

           17       instances, we are accountable to our clients      12:05PM

           18       because they are official contracts and they      12:06PM

           19       are paying us for that particular amount.         12:06PM

           20            Q.    Okay.  The amounts due under those     12:06PM

           21       contracts, right?                                 12:06PM

           22            A.    Yes.                                   12:06PM

            4       time is -- was there a writing between KBR        12:06PM

            5       and MFC, or between MFC and KBR, in which MFC     12:06PM

            6       said, okay, we are accepting this Termination     12:06PM

            7       Clause and the purpose that we are accepting      12:06PM

            8       it for is to prevent us from going to             12:06PM

            9       another -- a competitor of KBR?                   12:06PM

           10            A.    There was nothing in writing           12:06PM

           11       specifically that said that MFC was accepting     12:06PM

           12       it as prevention from going to -- going to a      12:07PM

           13       competitor.  However, there were writings         12:07PM

           14       where MFC said that we are accepting the          12:07PM

           15       clause.  We are only contesting the               12:07PM

           16       percentage.                                       12:07PM

           17            Q.    Okay.  And that's fair.  And we        12:07PM

           18       have seen those writings.  But none of those      12:07PM

           19       writings say we acknowledge that the purpose      12:07PM

           20       of this clause is to penalize us from going       12:07PM

           21       to a competitor?                                  12:07PM

           22            A.    It's not in writings, but that was     12:07PM

           23       clearly what was agreed in the meetings that      12:07PM

            3       there.  In fact, when we introduced 11.4, I       12:07PM

            4       believe the reaction from the MFC side was        12:07PM

            5       that they were expecting us to, at some           12:07PM

           11            A.    That was not in writing.  It was       12:07PM

           12       me sitting across the table from Mr. Ahsen        12:07PM

           14            Q.    Okay.  And Mr. Uddin didn't            12:08PM

           15       confirm these conversations in writing to         12:08PM

           16       you, correct?  And you didn't confirm those       12:08PM

           17       conversation in writing to him either,            12:08PM

           18       correct?                                          12:08PM

           19            A.    We did not confirm in writing, but     12:08PM

           20       we had -- we introduced that clause in the        12:08PM

           21       June 20th or 21st, 2013 meeting.  That clause     12:08PM

           22       was introduced and accepted, but the only         12:08PM

           23       thing that was outstanding was the amount.        12:08PM

           24       And I believe MFC, Mr. Ahsen Uddin, then took     12:08PM

           25       that internally and, at some point, like Ms.      12:08PM

            2       Barron showed, that he accepted that 30% was      12:08PM

            3       fair in case MFC terminated for convenience.      12:08PM

            4            Q.    Okay.  And in those emails, there      12:08PM

            5       were emails that Ms. Barron put up on the         12:08PM

            6       board, nowhere do they say that the purpose       12:08PM

            7       of this clause is to penalize MFC for going       12:08PM

           10       address KBR going to -- I'm sorry, MFC going      12:08PM

           11       a competitor.  However, I believe you also        12:08PM

           12       referred to these in your opening statements,     12:09PM

           13       2.1 and 9.1 is very clear in terms of who can     12:09PM

           14       be the EPC contractor and where the               12:09PM

           15       agreements can be assigned.  So we believe        12:09PM

           16       that there was no doubt in anyone's mind that     12:09PM

           17       the only way 11.4 would occur is if MFC chose     12:09PM

           18       to go to the KBR competitor.                      12:09PM

           19            Q.    Okay.  You internally at KBR           12:09PM

           22            A.    Yes, we talked about it in the         12:09PM

           23       meeting.  Like I said, we talked about it in      12:09PM

            2       Arif Dar, and MFC's outside counsel.  It was      12:09PM

            3       patently clear the intent of 11.4, because,       12:09PM

            4       again, I want to take you back to June 2013,      12:09PM

            5       there were only two clauses in there at that      12:09PM

            6       time, 11.3 and 11.4.  11.3 was actually --        12:10PM

            7       11.4 was introduced after 11.3.  So everybody     12:10PM

            8       was clear the intent of 11.4 was to               12:10PM

            9       compensate KBR in the event MFC goes to a         12:10PM

           10       competitor.                                       12:10PM

           11            Q.    And you have already testified         12:10PM

           12       that that conversation and that comported         12:10PM

           13       agreement was never confirmed in writing,         12:10PM

           14       correct?                                          12:10PM

           15            A.    I -- yeah, I mean, I'm not sure if     12:10PM

           16       it was.  There were thousands of emails, but      12:10PM

           17       I haven't seen anything in preparing for this     12:10PM

           18       statement where there may be a reference in       12:10PM

           19       writing to that clause applying if they go to     12:10PM

           20       a competitor.  If that's your question,           12:10PM

           21       right?                                            12:10PM

           22            Q.    Well, that's what your position        12:10PM

           23       is, right?                                        12:10PM

           24            A.    Yeah.                                  12:10PM

           25            Q.    Okay.  You never shared it in          12:10PM

            2       writing with MFC, right?                          12:11PM

            3            A.    We didn't have to because we           12:11PM

            4       agreed in the meeting.  There were about          12:11PM

            5       eight of us in the room, including MFC and        12:11PM

            6       KBR, including Mr. Lippmann.                      12:11PM

            7            Q.    And so the language you agreed on      12:11PM

            8       was so clear that you didn't need any             12:11PM

            9       clarification, right?                             12:11PM

           10            A.    We felt that that language, along      12:11PM

           11       with 2.1, 9.1, 11.3 and 11.5, was very clear.     12:11PM

           12       That 11.4 would only apply if MFC went to a       12:11PM

           13       competitor.                                       12:11PM

           14            Q.    Right.  So all in all, if you          12:11PM

           15       combine all those things together, you come       12:11PM

           16       up with your suit.  And your suit says that       12:11PM

           17       this clause was intended to penalize MFC if       12:11PM

           18       it goes to a competitor.                          12:11PM

           19            A.    The clause was intended to             12:11PM

           20       compensate KBR in case MFC went to a              12:11PM

           21       competitor after signing our agreement.           12:11PM

           22            Q.    As you wish, okay?  You didn't         12:11PM

           23       have the confirmatory email with MFC that         12:11PM

           24       said that this was intended to compensate KBR     12:12PM

           25       in the event that MFC went to a competitor.       12:12PM

            2            A.    Once we reached agreement in a         12:12PM

            3       face-to-face discussion, the purpose of which     12:12PM

            4       was to actually conclude our agreements and       12:12PM

            5       execute the agreements, we didn't feel it was     12:12PM

            6       necessary to document everything.  I mean, we     12:12PM

            7       are in a live negotiation with MFC's lead         12:12PM

            8       negotiator and their attorneys.  When we are      12:12PM

            9       agreeing on things, we are not documenting        12:12PM

           10       those in emails and saying this is the            12:12PM

           11       intent.  We are -- we have got a projector        12:12PM

           12       with a redline.  We are addressing redlines.      12:12PM

           13       We are agreeing to things, we are putting         12:12PM

           14       things in.  Whatever is left open is then         12:12PM

           15       captured as an open item.  And I believe in       12:12PM

           16       this particular case, once we concluded that      12:12PM

           17       meeting, the only open item was the               12:12PM

           18       percentage.                                       12:12PM

           19            Q.    Okay.  And the open item was           12:12PM

           20       discussed by email, was it not?                   12:12PM

           21            A.    Mr. Uddin, yes, I remember him         12:13PM

           22       sending an email saying, you know, this           12:13PM

           23       amount will be contested.  In fact, I believe     12:13PM

           24       he also said that, you know, we need to           12:13PM

           25       revisit the amount, or Mr. Mukhtar raised it      12:13PM

            2       directly with Mr. Derbyshire.  And I believe      12:13PM

            3       subsequently to that, Mr. Uddin got internal      12:13PM

            4       acceptance for 30% and felt that that was a       12:13PM

            5       fair amount.                                      12:13PM

            6            Q.    Okay.  Then putting aside the          12:13PM

            7       percentages and whether or not it's a penalty     12:13PM

            8       or whether or not it's compensation,              12:13PM

            9       Mr. Uddin never got back to you and said we       12:13PM

           10       accept this because it's supposed to be a         12:13PM

           11       compensation for KBR in the event that we go      12:13PM

           12       to a competitor?                                  12:13PM

           13            A.    Because we considered the matter       12:13PM

           14       closed.  Both sides agreed on the intent.         12:13PM

           15       And, at that point, we had considered that        12:13PM

           16       matter closed.  In fact, it never came up         12:13PM

           17       again until our final negotiation.  There         12:13PM

           18       were several other things that we discussed,      12:14PM

           19       even delays in the NTP that were discussed        12:14PM

           20       subsequent to the June 2013 meeting.  But         12:14PM

           21       this issue was rested and it was closed out.      12:14PM

           22            Q.    Okay.  So to go back to my             12:14PM

           23       question, there was never any email or any        12:14PM

           24       written communication between MFC and KBR         12:14PM

            2       this clause would apply in the event that you     12:14PM

            3       go to a competitor.  No such email, right?        12:14PM

            4            A.    No email.                              12:14PM

            5            Q.    Okay.  And no such email from MFC      12:14PM

            6       acknowledging that that was the intent of the     12:14PM

            7       clause, correct?                                  12:14PM

            8            A.    Well, the only internal email          12:14PM

            9       that, you know, I guess I can take you back       12:14PM

           10       to this exhibit that you gave me, which is I      12:14PM

           11       believe JX-5, where Bryan mentions that we --     12:14PM

           12       excuse me, insisted upon this provision to        12:14PM

           13       penalize the client should an attempt to work     12:15PM

           14       with a competitor to KBR.  So this a record       12:15PM

           15       of the conversation that took place on that       12:15PM

           16       day.  And as I mentioned, Mr. Blades is           12:15PM

           18                  So this is what he communicated        12:15PM

           19       internally.  This is precisely, as he is          12:15PM

           20       reporting here, what was communicated on that     12:15PM

           22            Q.    So -- but Mr. Blades, in this          12:15PM

           23       document, doesn't say that that was               12:15PM

            4                  Does it say that we told MFC that      12:15PM

            5       that's our intent?                                12:15PM

            9       of the entire day's discussion.  And if I may     12:15PM

           10       read what Mr. Blade is saying, "In exchange       12:15PM

            2       right?                                            12:16PM

            3            A.    Well, this is an internal document     12:16PM

            4       on the status report, correct.                    12:16PM

            5            Q.    And, in fact, it's labeled, if you     12:16PM

            6       go to the bottom, "HIGHLY                         12:16PM

            7       CONFIDENTIAL-OUTSIDE COUNSEL EYES ONLY,"          12:16PM

            8       right?                                            12:16PM

            9            A.    Yes.                                   12:16PM

           10            Q.    Okay.  So this wasn't even             12:16PM

           11       supposed to be shared with MFC to this day;       12:16PM

           12       am I correct?                                     12:16PM

           13            A.    I'm not sure if that -- I think I      12:16PM

           14       would let my outside counsel respond to that.     12:16PM

           15       I'm not aware of that.                            12:16PM

           16            Q.    Okay.  But the bottom line is that     12:16PM

           17       nothing of this sort, nothing that reflects       12:16PM

           18       the language of this paragraph that you just      12:16PM

           19       pointed to, was ever shared with MFC, right?      12:17PM

           20            A.    No.  As I mentioned earlier, it        12:17PM

           21       was shared in great detail with MFC in the        12:17PM

           22       June 20th meeting, sitting across the table       12:17PM

           23       from Mr. Ahsen Uddin.  And as I also stated,      12:17PM

           24       I remember precisely when this clause was         12:17PM

           25       introduced, because Mr. Ahsen Uddin               12:17PM

                                                               164

            2       acknowledged that they were expecting KBR to      12:17PM

            3       bring this up.                                    12:17PM

            4            Q.    Right.  So my question again, was      12:17PM

            5       this language, a writing containing this          12:17PM

            6       language, ever shared with MFC?  And I think      12:17PM

            7       your answer would be no, right?                   12:17PM

            8            A.    Writing containing the language        12:17PM

            9       that -- could you repeat the language,            12:17PM

           10       specific language?                                12:17PM

           11            Q.    The language you just quoted, was      12:17PM

           12       there ever a writing between KBR and MFC that     12:17PM

           13       contained language like this?                     12:17PM

           14            A.    I don't believe so.                    12:17PM

           24            A.    Yes.                                   12:27PM

            2       you and Mr. Divanji dated May 14th, 2015,         12:28PM

            3       correct?                                          12:28PM

            4            A.    Correct.                               12:28PM

            5            Q.    Okay.  And you were taking the         12:28PM

            6       opportunity here to explain to Mr. Divanji        12:28PM

            7       the intent of the Termination for Convenience     12:28PM

            8       Clause in the License Agreement, right?           12:28PM

            9            A.    Correct.                               12:28PM

           10            Q.    And you begin by, "This is             12:28PM

           11       precisely why the Penalty Clause was inserted     12:28PM

           12       in the Agreement - so that MFC doesn't            12:28PM

           13       'freely' go to another competitor."               12:28PM

           14                  Do you see that?                       12:28PM

           15            A.    Yes.                                   12:28PM

           16            Q.    So you adopted the phrase "Penalty     12:28PM

           17       Clause," right?                                   12:28PM

           18            A.    That's what it says, yes.              12:28PM

           19            Q.    And those are your words, right?       12:28PM

           20            A.    Yes.                                   12:28PM

           21            Q.    Okay.  And not only did you call       12:28PM

           22       it a Penalty Clause in the first paragraph,       12:28PM

           23       you go down one, two, three paragraphs after      12:28PM

           24       that, you say, "In the grand scheme of            12:28PM

           25       things, the penalty is inconsequential...on       12:29PM

            3       to another EPC," right?                           12:29PM

            4            A.    Yes.                                   12:29PM

            5            Q.    So that's really not consistent        12:29PM

            6       with the first paragraph, except to the           12:29PM

            7       extent you are referring to the clause as a       12:29PM

            8       penalty.                                          12:29PM

            9            A.    Sorry, what is not consistent with     12:29PM

           10       the first paragraph?                              12:29PM

           11            Q.    Okay.  So you are saying that this     12:29PM

           12       clause was designed to keep MFC from freely       12:29PM

           13       going to another competitor, right?  You said     12:29PM

           14       that in the first paragraph?                      12:29PM

           15            A.    Yes.                                   12:29PM

           16            Q.    Right?                                 12:29PM

           17                  And you referred it to as the          12:29PM

           18       Penalty Clause, right?                            12:29PM

           19            A.    Yes.                                   12:29PM

           20            Q.    Okay.  And the next paragraph that     12:29PM

           21       I quoted, you say, "In the grand scheme of        12:29PM

           22       things, the penalty," again you call it a         12:29PM

           23       penalty, "is inconsequential and on its own       12:29PM

           24       will not prevent MFC from going to another        12:29PM

           25       EPC," right?                                      12:29PM

            2            A.    Correct.                               12:29PM

            3            Q.    So does that mean the -- well,         12:29PM

            4       it's either designed to keep it from going to     12:29PM

            5       another EPC or not designed to go -- to keep      12:29PM

            6       it from going to another EPC.  And you are        12:29PM

            7       saying here that it's not effective in any        12:30PM

            8       event, right?                                     12:30PM

            9            A.    What I'm saying in the first           12:30PM

           10       sentence, I mean, of course, MFC was free to      12:30PM

           11       go anywhere, you know, but it had to              12:30PM

           12       compensate KBR if it chose to terminate for       12:30PM

           13       convenience.  The License Agreement at no         12:30PM

           14       point stated that MFC has to buy KBR              12:30PM

           15       technology.  There is nothing in the License      12:30PM

           16       Agreement that states that they have to build     12:30PM

           17       the plan using KBR technology, or for that        12:30PM

           18       matter, assign EPC with KBR as the EPC            12:30PM

           19       provider.                                         12:30PM

           20                  What I'm saying over here is that      12:30PM

           21       MFC, you know, can't freely, quote, unquote,      12:30PM

           22       go to another competitor.  They can certainly     12:30PM

           23       go to the competitor, but they have to honor      12:30PM

           24       their payment under Clause 11.4.  And I           12:30PM

            2       Haresh, if I go further down, where MFC had       12:30PM

            3       specifically asked us to waive 11.4 in the        12:30PM

           12            A.    Right.                                 12:31PM

           13            Q.    And for a third time in the email      12:31PM

           14       you call it a penalty, right?                     12:31PM

           16            Q.    Okay.  Did you ever correct            12:31PM

           17       yourself and say, oh, I'm sorry, it's not a       12:31PM

           22       says, "If MFC walks away at the end, at least     12:31PM

           23       the penalty" would "help KBR offset part of       12:31PM

           24       the investment."                                  12:31PM

            2       many, many months.  And when we negotiated        12:31PM

            3       11.4, the intent was to compensate us for         12:31PM

            4       that investment in time and resources.            12:32PM

            5            Q.    You could have called it a             12:32PM

            6       termination fee and not a penalty, right?         12:32PM

            7            A.    Probably so.                           12:32PM

            8            Q.    I'm going to show you 576.  And if     12:32PM

            9       you go to the second page of 576, you will        12:32PM

           10       see there is an email there from you to           12:32PM

           11       Haresh Divanji and some others.  Do you see       12:32PM

           12       that?  It's dated May 13, 2015, towards the       12:32PM

           13       bottom of the second page?                        12:32PM

           14            A.    Yes.                                   12:32PM

           15            Q.    Okay.  And this is language that       12:32PM

           16       Ms. Barron had already quoted during her          12:33PM

           17       opening statement, but I'm not bringing it in     12:33PM

           18       for the reason that we normally rely on this      12:33PM

           19       language.  But at the very last sentence of       12:33PM

           20       the very last paragraph of this email, you        12:33PM

           21       say, "However, if MFC can't reach financial       12:33PM

           22       close, then MFC doesn't incur any penalty."       12:33PM

           23                  Do you see that?                       12:33PM

           24            A.    Yes.                                   12:33PM

           25            Q.    You referred to the clause again,      12:33PM

            4            A.    Sorry, I'm not -- where am I           12:33PM

            5       referring?                                        12:33PM

            6            Q.    The very last sentence of the very     12:33PM

            7       last paragraph on this page, you say,             12:33PM

            8       "However, if MFC can't reach financial close,     12:33PM

            9       then MFC doesn't incur any penalty," right?       12:33PM

           10            A.    Yeah, that's what I --                 12:33PM

           11            Q.    And you are referring to the           12:33PM

           12       Termination for Convenience Clause again,         12:33PM

           13       right?                                            12:33PM

           14            A.    I'm referring to -- no, I'm not        12:33PM

           15       referring to the Termination for Convenience      12:33PM

           16       Clause up here.  I'm referring to 11.3 and        12:33PM

           17       11.5, because if MFC does not reach or can't      12:34PM

           18       reach Financial Close, then that obviously        12:34PM

           19       means that the project does not move forward.     12:34PM

           20       Under that particular circumstance, MFC would     12:34PM

           21       not be liable for Termination for                 12:34PM

           22       Convenience.                                      12:34PM

           23            Q.    Yes.  That's all well and good.        12:34PM

           24                  However, neither of those clauses      12:34PM

           25       have any fees attached to them, right?            12:34PM

            2            A.    11.3 or 11.5?                          12:34PM

            3            Q.    Right.                                 12:34PM

            4            A.    In those cases where MFC               12:34PM

            5       terminates rightfully under 11.3 and 11.5,        12:34PM

            6       the only instance that would happen is if the     12:34PM

            7       project is cancelled and MFC decides not to       12:34PM

            8       proceed with the project altogether because       12:34PM

            9       they were not able to get financing.              12:34PM

           10            Q.    Yeah, I know your position on this     12:34PM

           11       and we have heard it.  But please answer my       12:34PM

           12       question.                                         12:34PM

           13                  Do either of those clauses have a      12:34PM

           14       penalty attached to them?  11.3 or 11.5, do       12:34PM

           15       either of them require that MFC pay a             12:35PM

           16       penalty?                                          12:35PM

           17            A.    If they don't -- if they cancel        12:35PM

           18       the project, there is no penalty.                 12:35PM

           19            Q.    Okay.  Under 11.3 or 11.5, there's     12:35PM

           20       no penalty, right?                                12:35PM

           21            A.    If the project is cancelled.           12:35PM

           22            Q.    Right.  And if you look at 11.4,       12:35PM

           23       however, and you -- your words, there is a        12:35PM

           16            Q.    I'm sorry.                             12:39PM

            4            Q.    Okay.  And looking at the first        12:39PM

            5       sentence, again this is you to Haresh, "This      12:39PM

           11            Q.    Okay.  And, actually, let's look       12:39PM

           12       up at -- this email -- I apologize.               12:39PM

           15            A.    Correct.                               12:39PM

           16            Q.    Let's go to the email on the top,      12:39PM

           17       which is from Mr. Centner, dated Friday,          12:39PM

           18       May 15, 2015, at 7:46 p.m. to John Derbyshire     12:39PM

           19       and yourself, where he says, "Please note the     12:40PM

           20       e-mail from Aman below which details the          12:40PM

           21       current situation" regarding "the Penalty         12:40PM

           22       Clause," right?  So Mr. Centner was also          12:40PM

           23       referring to the clause as the Penalty            12:40PM

           24       Clause, right?                                    12:40PM

            2            Q.    And he not only does it once, but      12:40PM

            3       he does it another time in the next paragraph     12:40PM

            4       where he says, "From my perspective, the          12:40PM

            5       important issue here is that the Penalty          12:40PM

            6       Clause is the only leverage that KBR has if       12:40PM

            7       Fawad chooses a different Ammonia                 12:40PM

            8       Technology," right?  And he calls it again        12:40PM

            9       the Penalty Clause, correct?  And the reason      12:40PM

           10       why he is saying that, is he not, is because      12:40PM

           11       there is nothing in the KBR License Agreement     12:40PM

           12       which prohibits MFC from choosing a different     12:40PM

           13       Ammonia Technology, right?                        12:40PM

           14            A.    Yes, there is.  There is Clauses       12:40PM

           15       2.1 and 9.1 talk about MFC going to a             12:40PM

           16       competitor.  They can't assign the technology     12:41PM

           17       to a competitor of KBR, which, in this case,      12:41PM

           18       would be TKIS.  So there are provisions in        12:41PM

           19       the License Agreement that address KBR's          12:41PM

           20       competitors.                                      12:41PM

           21            Q.    Right.  But if MFC picked up one       12:41PM

           22       day and signed an Ammonia License Agreement       12:41PM

           23       with another Ammonia licensor, there is           12:41PM

           24       nothing in the KBR License Agreement that         12:41PM

           25       says they can't do that, right?                   12:41PM

            4            A.    Yes.                                   12:44PM

            5            Q.    Okay.  And by the way, we -- I'm       12:44PM

            6       going to divergence for a second.  When we        12:44PM

            7       had talked earlier, you mentioned there was a     12:44PM

            8       reputational aspect to this, that KBR would       12:44PM

            9       suffer reputational damage if MFC went off        12:44PM

           10       and signed with a competitor, right?              12:45PM

           11            A.    Yes.                                   12:45PM

           12            Q.    And that KBR expected to be            12:45PM

           13       compensated for that, right?                      12:45PM

           14            A.    I mean, I said, you know, there        12:45PM

           15       were other things in addition to our time and     12:45PM

           16       resources, you know, when we talk about MFC       12:45PM

           17       moving to a competitor, there are other           12:45PM

           18       implications for KBR.  One of those is            12:45PM

           19       reputational risk.                                12:45PM

           20            Q.    Okay.                                  12:45PM

           21            A.    Because the market, if I may add,      12:45PM

           22       was aware that MFC had signed with KBR.  And      12:45PM

           23       it was made public knowledge by MFC in their      12:45PM

           24       bond filings.  So there was obviously a           12:45PM

           25       concern when MFC announced that they had          12:45PM

            3            Q.    Right.  So what you're saying is,      12:45PM

            4       then, as a consequence of MFC signing with        12:45PM

            5       another licensor, KBR would suffer                12:45PM

            6       potentially reputational damage, right?           12:46PM

            7            A.    So we were aware -- I mean,            12:46PM

            8       obviously any time, you know, we have an          12:46PM

            9       agreement that is signed, and I'm talking --      12:46PM

           10       I'm not just talking about a verbal agreement     12:46PM

           11       here, I'm referring to a contract, signed         12:46PM

           12       contracts for licensing.  And one of our          12:46PM

           13       competitors and -- client moves to one of our     12:46PM

           14       competitors, while they have obviously used       12:46PM

           15       our agreements to progress things a certain       12:46PM

           16       way, there is a certain, you know, negative       12:46PM

           17       message that perhaps goes out in the market.      12:46PM

           18       And there is a reputational aspect to it.         12:46PM

           19                  We were also concerned that after      12:46PM

           20       MFC moved towards TKIS, there were some --        12:46PM

           21       you know, just like our customers, we had         12:46PM

           22       very close relationships with our vendors and     12:46PM

           23       our close suppliers.  And there were              12:46PM

           24       instances where some of our suppliers were        12:46PM

           25       receiving material that was provided by KBR       12:46PM

                                                               180

            7       strike your answer, because I think you just      12:47PM

            8       said a lot of things that I can use.  So why      12:47PM

            9       don't we do this.                                 12:47PM

           12       far as you were concerned, and you set forth      12:47PM

           13       a whole bunch of things, earlier on in your       12:47PM

           14       testimony that KBR might suffer if MFC went       12:47PM

           15       to another vendor, right?                         12:47PM

           16            A.    KBR might suffer?                      12:47PM

           17            Q.    Yes.  KBR suffers damage as a          12:47PM

           18       result of MFC going to another vendor, right?     12:47PM

           19       And that's why you want comp -- no damage?        12:47PM

           20            A.    No.  MFC is free to go to anybody      12:47PM

           21       that they wanted to.  But there was a             12:47PM

           22       Termination for Convenience which is, you         12:47PM

           23       know, they could pay our fee and compensate       12:48PM

           24       us and move away any time they wanted to.         12:48PM

           25            Q.    Right.  And you can get                12:48PM

                                                               181

            2       compensated even though you had no damage,        12:48PM

            3       right?                                            12:48PM

            4            A.    How would you define damage?  What     12:48PM

            5       do you mean by damage?                            12:48PM

            6            Q.    Well, do you understand the            12:48PM

            7       concept of damage?                                12:48PM

            8            A.    There is different kinds of            12:48PM

            9       damages.  We have consequential damages.  We      12:48PM

           10       have direct damages.  I'm not sure what           12:48PM

           11       context you're referring to over here.            12:48PM

           12            Q.    No, I don't think we are               12:48PM

           13       distinguishing between any of those.  You         12:48PM

           14       understand that if KBR has to be compensated,     12:48PM

           15       it's being compensated for some stuff that it     12:48PM

           16       did that it didn't get paid for, right?           12:48PM

           17       Isn't that correct?                               12:48PM

           18            A.    They have to be compensated -- we      12:48PM

           19       have to be compensated for our efforts in         12:48PM

           20       helping MFC take the project forward.             12:48PM

           21            Q.    Right.  And that's not what I just     12:48PM

           22       said?                                             12:48PM

           23            A.    I wasn't sure.  I think you were       12:48PM

           24       talking about damages in there, sir.              12:48PM

           25            Q.    All right.  So KBR gets                12:48PM

                                                               182

            2       compensated for efforts that it made insofar      12:48PM

            3       as its relationship with MFC, if MFC goes to      12:49PM

            4       a competitor, right?  Is that a fair              12:49PM

            5       formulation?                                      12:49PM

            6            A.    Well, KBR should also get              12:49PM

            7       compensated, was our view, for the time and       12:49PM

            8       effort that we invested in taking the project     12:49PM

            9       forward.                                          12:49PM

           10            Q.    Right.  So the time and effort         12:49PM

           11       that KBR had spent, we've talked about that.      12:49PM

           12       I meant KBR gets compensated for that if MFC      12:49PM

           13       goes a competitor, right?                         12:49PM

           14            A.    If MFC pays under 11.4.                12:49PM

           15            Q.    Well, KBR is entitled -- you are       12:49PM

           16       saying KBR is entitled to that compensation       12:49PM

           17       for the time and effort it put in on account      12:49PM

           18       of the MFC relationship, if MFC goes to a         12:49PM

           19       competitor?                                       12:49PM

           20            A.    I'm not sure I understand your         12:49PM

           21       question.                                         12:49PM

           22            Q.    If MFC goes to a competitor, KBR       12:49PM

           23       gets paid, right?  Isn't that your position?      12:49PM

           24            A.    Under 11.4.                            12:49PM

           25            Q.    Under 11.4.                            12:49PM

                                                               183



            1                      CROSS - A. AHMAD

            2            A.    Correct.                               12:49PM

            3            Q.    Okay.  And the reason why KBR gets     12:49PM

            4       paid is because it incurred costs, it             12:49PM

            5       incurred man-hours, it incurred reputational      12:50PM

            6       damage, it incurred a whole bunch of things       12:50PM

            7       that it's entitled to get compensated for if      12:50PM

            8       MFC goes to a competitor, correct?                12:50PM

            9            A.    Correct.                               12:50PM

           10            Q.    Okay.  So with respect to the          12:50PM

           11       costs, with respect to the man-hours, all         12:50PM

           12       that stuff, none of that is something that        12:50PM

           13       KBR gets compensated for under the License        12:50PM

           14       Agreement, right?                                 12:50PM

           15            A.    Correct.  Until the NTP.               12:50PM

           16            Q.    Until the -- right.  Until the --      12:50PM

           17       well, until you get a license fee, which is a     12:50PM

           18       license for the technology?                       12:50PM

           19            A.    Correct.                               12:50PM

           20            Q.    Right, right?                          12:50PM

           21                  And that may or may not have to do     12:50PM

           22       with efforts that were put in, right?             12:50PM

           23            A.    Right.                                 12:50PM

           24            Q.    You get that license fee even if       12:50PM

           25       you put in no effort, correct?                    12:50PM

            2            A.    No.  We don't get a license fee if     12:50PM

            3       we put in no effort.  As I explained to you       12:50PM

            4       earlier, the License and Engineering              12:50PM

            5       Agreements are -- they go hand in hand.  We       12:50PM

            6       can't sign one without signing the other.  We     12:50PM

            7       can't just sign the License Agreement because     12:51PM

            8       it would be meaningless.  Because the             12:51PM

            9       deliverables, the blueprints, if you will, of     12:51PM

           10       the plant, the actual physical documents that     12:51PM

           11       MFC would need to give to an EPC contractor       12:51PM

           12       to turn it into an LSD for bid or to build        12:51PM

           13       the plant would be generated under the            12:51PM

           14       Engineering Agreement.                            12:51PM

           15            Q.    Okay.  The Termination Clause is       12:51PM

           16       in the License Agreement, right?                  12:51PM

           17            A.    Yes.                                   12:51PM

           18            Q.    Okay.  And the Termination             12:51PM

           19       Clause -- I'm sorry.                              12:51PM

           20                  The License Agreement has, as far      12:51PM

           21       as KBR is concerned, a license fee, right?        12:51PM

           22            A.    Yes.                                   12:51PM

           23            Q.    That license fee is not due until      12:51PM

           24       Notice to Proceed, right?                         12:51PM

           25            A.    Correct.                               12:51PM

            2            Q.    Okay.  When you talk about             12:51PM

            3       reputational damage, okay, you are saying         12:51PM

            4       that damage arises as a consequence of MFC        12:51PM

            5       going to a third party, right?                    12:51PM

            6            A.    It can be several things.  You         12:51PM

            7       know, one example I cited earlier was when we     12:52PM

            8       had signed the License Agreement, MFC's bond      12:52PM

            9       counsel came to KBR and asked KBR to provide      12:52PM

           10       a letter, an official letter from KBR,            12:52PM

           11       stating that the life expectancy of this          12:52PM

           12       plant will be 25 to 40 years.  Now, that          12:52PM

           13       letter on KBR's letterhead, an official           12:52PM

           14       communication, was used by MFC to progress        12:52PM

           15       things with the bond counsel.                     12:52PM

           16                  Of course, concern on our side         12:52PM

           17       would be that that letter was used to achieve     12:52PM

           18       a certain objective.  If, months later, the       12:52PM

           19       bond counsel hears that a different licensor      12:52PM

           20       has stepped in, then it does compromise our,      12:52PM

           21       you know, position in the market somehow.  So     12:52PM

           22       we are sensitive to that.                         12:52PM

           23                  MR. HELLER:  Okay.  So I think         12:52PM

           24            if we have to go more, if we have to         12:53PM

           25            extend ourselves to the full length of       12:53PM

            2            what we are allocated to, part of it         12:53PM

            3            is going to be because this witness          12:53PM

            4            goes on extended frolics in response         12:53PM

            7            again, that this witness be cautioned        12:53PM

           10            I think that it's fair to ask the            12:53PM

           11            witness to respond directly to the           12:53PM

           12            questions to the extent you can.  But        12:53PM

           13            by the same token, we are going over         12:53PM

           14            some of the same ground.  So to the          12:53PM

           15            extent that you can focus your               12:53PM

           16            questions, then I think we will be           12:53PM

           17            able to proceed to move forward.             12:53PM

           18                  MR. HELLER:  Yeah.  I think my         12:53PM

           19            question is focused.  And without --         12:53PM

           20            you know, and I do concede that some         12:53PM

           21            of this was rehashing, but this              12:53PM

           22            question was focused.  So, I mean --         12:53PM

           23                  ARBITRATOR COHEN:  Why don't we        12:53PM

           24            go back to the question.                     12:54PM

           25                  MR. HELLER:  Okay.                     12:54PM

            2            Q.    I'm going to ask it again.             12:54PM

            3                  When you say that MFC suffers          12:54PM

            4       reputational damage that it is entitled to be     12:54PM

            5       compensated for --                                12:54PM

            6            A.    KBR?                                   12:54PM

            7            Q.    Yes.  Thank you for the                12:54PM

            8       correction.                                       12:54PM

            9                  You say KBR suffers reputational       12:54PM

           10       damage that it's entitled to be compensated       12:54PM

           11       for, that reputational damage would arise as      12:54PM

           12       a consequence of MFC signing an agreement         12:54PM

           13       with a competitor of KBR; is that correct?        12:54PM

           14            A.    Yes.  After it has signed an           12:54PM

           15       agreement with KBR.                               12:54PM

           16            Q.    Okay.                                  12:54PM

           17            A.    If it moves to a competitor.           12:54PM

           18            Q.    And then as a consequence of           12:54PM

           19       having signed with the competitor, KBR            12:54PM

           20       suffers this reputational damage that it's        12:54PM

           21       entitled to be compensated for, right?            12:54PM

           22            A.    The -- MFC can sign with any           12:54PM

           23       competitor.  After signing with KBR, if they      12:54PM

           24       move to a competitor, that's where the -- we      12:54PM

            3       answering yes or are you answering no?            12:54PM

           10            A.    I would say that, you know, that       12:55PM

           11       would -- you know, our intent for 11.4 was        12:55PM

           12       to -- you know, we didn't identify                12:55PM

           13       specifically reputational damage.  The intent     12:55PM

           14       of 11.4 was to compensate KBR for the effort      12:55PM

           15       we had invested in bringing the project thus      12:55PM

           16       far.                                              12:55PM

           17            Q.    Okay.  So to the extent that you       12:55PM

           18       testified already that 11.4 was designed in       12:55PM

           19       part to compensate KBR for reputational           12:55PM

           20       damages, are you walking that back now?           12:55PM

           21            A.    No.                                    12:55PM

           22            Q.    Okay.  So then I really don't          12:55PM

           23       understand your answer.                           12:56PM

            2                  Forget it.  I'm going to ask the       12:56PM

            3            question again and we'll see if we get       12:56PM

           11       MFC product to a point, right?                    12:56PM

           12            A.    Correct.                               12:56PM

           13            Q.    Okay.  And in addition to that         12:56PM

           14       whole menu of stuff, you said that KBR is         12:56PM

           15       entitled to be compensated for its                12:56PM

           16       reputational damage?                              12:56PM

           17            A.    Correct.                               12:56PM

           18            Q.    Okay.  And that reputational           12:56PM

           19       damage, it's fair to say, would arise as a        12:56PM

           20       consequence of MFC having signed with a third     12:56PM

           21       party; is that correct?                           12:56PM

           22            A.    Correct.  After signing with KBR.      12:57PM

           23            Q.    Okay.  And MFC has already signed      12:57PM

           24       with KBR, it's already bound by 11.4, it goes     12:57PM

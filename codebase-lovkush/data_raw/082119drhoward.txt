      1    WHEREUPON:

      2                     THOMAS P. HOWARD, M.D.,

      3         A witness herein, acknowledged having been duly

      4         sworn and testified upon his oath as follows:

      5              THE WITNESS:  I do.

      6                       DIRECT EXAMINATION

      7    BY MS. MCMORRIS:

      8         Q.   Good morning, Dr. Howard.

      9         A.   Good morning, Leah.

     10         Q.   Can you hear me all right?

     11         A.   Yes, I can.  How about you?

     12         Q.   I can hear you just fine.

     13         A.   All right.  Good.

     14         Q.   So can you please state your name for the

     15    record?

     16         A.   Yes, Thomas Peter Howard.

     17         Q.   And my name is Leah McMorris, I represent the

     18    plaintiff in this case and I'll be taking your deposition

     19    this morning.  Where is it that you are located today?

     20         A.   I'm in a court reporting office, which is in I

     21    think the address is Viera, Florida, but it's near my

     22    home in Melbourne, Florida.

     23         Q.   And is there anyone there with you?

     24         A.   Yes.  Yvette Harrison the court reporter is

     25    here.






                                                                    5




      1         Q.   And is your attorney there as well?

      2         A.   No, he's on the phone.

      3              MR. SPEZIALI:  I'm sitting in New Jersey.

      4              MS. MCMORRIS:  All right.

      5              MR. SPEZIALI:  And I thank you for changing it

      6         for a phone dep, which is why I didn't have to go

      7         down there.

      8    BY MS. MCMORRIS:

      9         Q.   And your attorney is -- I'm sorry, strike that.

     10    You are designated as a witness in this case at the

     11    request of General Electric and Westinghouse; is that

     12    correct?

     13         A.   That's my understanding, yes.

     14         Q.   Okay.  No one else?

     15         A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

     16         Q.   Okay.  And I don't think -- you've been deposed

     17    many times in the past, so I won't go through all of the

     18    general rules for a deposition.  But I just ask at any

     19    point you can't hear me or you don't understand my

     20    question, just let me know and I'll rephrase the question

     21    or speak up and make sure that you can hear me.  Is that

     22    fair?

     23         A.   Yes.

     24         Q.   All right.  Great.  Are you currently employed,

     25    Dr. Howard?






                                                                    6




      1         A.   I retired from the VA in 2017.  I certainly

      2    continued to do litigation consultation work, but I don't

      3    know if that satisfies your definition of employment.

      4    I'm retired from the VA.

      5         Q.   How often do you perform litigation consultant

      6    work?

      7         A.   I review probably on average about two cases a

      8    week.  But if you're asking me about depositions and

      9    trial testimony, it's certainly less than that.  I think

     10    I'm estimating this is about the fifth deposition this

     11    year.  And on average I would think it ranges between

     12    five and ten the last few years at least.

     13              And then in trial I probably testify on average

     14    maybe once every year, maybe a little less than that

     15    recently.

     16         Q.   What percentage of those cases are asbestos

     17    related cases?

     18         A.   Well, this year I would -- certainly the vast

     19    majority are asbestos related.  I'm working on one rather

     20    large tobacco litigation case, so that would be the only

     21    one right now that is not asbestos related.  I think it

     22    would probably be about 75 to 95 on an average basis over

     23    the last several years are asbestos related.

     24         Q.   When were you initially contacted regarding the

     25    Drummond case?






                                                                    7




      1         A.   Well, I have no independent recollection of a

      2    specific date, but based on my report I would estimate

      3    that it would have certainly been within a few weeks of

      4    September 2018.

      5         Q.   And what were you asked to do following your

      6    retention on this case?

      7         A.   Well, I'm again referring to my report, but

      8    usually as stated in my report I'm asked to be -- review

      9    records and deposition testimony as in this case and then

     10    to be willing to render either a report or testify in

     11    deposition usually about state of the art issues.

     12              Although, as a pulmonologist, frequently as in

     13    this case I was asked to review medical records and would

     14    expect to weigh in on medical issues as well.  So state

     15    of the art, medical issues.

     16              And then as noted in my report address the

     17    probability if you will of warnings changing the

     18    direction of Mr. Drummond's case.

     19         Q.   So in addition -- it is my understanding you

     20    reviewed Mr. Drummond's deposition testimony in this

     21    case?

     22         A.   Yes.  I brought with me today what I reviewed,

     23    which I think is 11 volumes of deposition testimony.

     24         Q.   Okay.  Is there anything else that you brought

     25    with you to the deposition today?






                                                                    8




      1         A.   Yes.  I brought my CV or a copy of my CV and my

      2    report, which I authored in September of 2018.  In

      3    addition the medical records I brought, which I reviewed

      4    and cited I think in my report from 2016 and '17.  And

      5    then recently was provided with a death certificate as

      6    well.  So I brought all those things with me.

      7         Q.   Did you prepare any notes in preparation for

      8    your deposition today?

      9         A.   No.

     10         Q.   So in addition to the deposition volumes, the

     11    medical record and Mr. Drummond's death certificate, were

     12    you given any other factual information about the

     13    substance of the Drummond case from counsel or anyone

     14    else that formed the basis of any of your opinions?

     15         A.   No.

     16         Q.   And, Dr. Howard, are you being compensated for

     17    your work on the Drummond case?

     18         A.   I expect to be.  I've not rendered a bill.  But

     19    I would certainly expect to be for the work that I've

     20    done in this case as well as today's session.

     21         Q.   What is your hourly rate?

     22         A.   $450.

     23         Q.   Do you have an approximation of how many hours

     24    you've worked on the Drummond case?

     25         A.   Yes.  Prior to and including my creation of the






                                                                    9




      1    report in September of '18, I had spent seven hours on

      2    the case.  And since then I've spent an hour rereviewing

      3    the materials I mentioned to you and then a 15 minute

      4    conference with Mr. Speziali.  So I think it's eight

      5    hours and a quarter.

      6         Q.   Were you asked to give any medical causation

      7    opinions in this case?

      8         A.   I haven't actually been asked anything specific

      9    other than what I mentioned.  But I would expect that one

     10    of the two parties would ask me if I thought this was an

     11    asbestos related mesothelioma and I do.

     12         Q.   Do you have any additional medical causation

     13    opinions in addition to the opinion you just expressed

     14    that this is an asbestos related mesothelioma?

     15         A.   Well, I have nothing prepared to cite and again

     16    I haven't been asked any questions.  But, typically, I

     17    would expect that there would be questions about -- and I

     18    actually referred to this within my report certainly that

     19    this case like many I believe in this era at least is

     20    typically related to remote asbestos exposure in the

     21    workplace.

     22              And both historically and currently I think

     23    there's a wealth of information supporting a fiber

     24    differential in that causation and I would expect to

     25    reflect on the Navy's use and knowledge about asbestos






                                                                   10




      1    throughout the historical period of time of probably the

      2    1940s through at least OSHA in 1972.

      3              So I would expect again I don't have any

      4    specific script to tell you what my exact opinions are

      5    there, but I would welcome any questions concerning that.

      6              I would -- I cited as best I could the

      7    variables that I and most physicians and medical

      8    scientist look to to try to establish causation in terms

      9    of the nature of the exposure, specifically the

     10    frequency, the intensity, the duration, the product

     11    itself in terms of the friability or respirability of the

     12    asbestos contained within that product.  And I certainly

     13    look to all those in trying to establish a specific

     14    causation.

     15              As I noted in this case from the deposition

     16    testimony, specifically regarding Westinghouse and GE, I

     17    thought there were very few of those specifics that were

     18    able to be cited.  So I mention that in the report.

     19              Certainly, if there's other information

     20    regarding that, I would factor all that in.  So I don't

     21    know if that answers your question globally at least.  I

     22    would expect to have a lot of opinions regarding that

     23    general area based on primarily the deposition testimony

     24    or more importantly the historical medical literature and

     25    how it developed.






                                                                   11




      1         Q.   Okay.  So looking at your report that's dated

      2    September 14th, 2018, how did this report come to be

      3    prepared?

      4         A.   So I need to clarify.  The report that I

      5    believe I rendered in this case was authored on

      6    September 11th.  Is that -- are we looking at the same

      7    report?

      8         Q.   That's correct.  It was served on

      9    September 14th, so that was the date I was representing.

     10    But you're correct, the report is dated September 11th.

     11         A.   Oh, I see.  Okay.  So if I understand your

     12    question, I put together this information and tried to

     13    summarize not only case specific details, which are

     14    relatively few as you probably noted, it's probably two

     15    or three paragraphs based on the deposition testimony and

     16    then at the end I insert information that I gleaned from

     17    review of the medical records.

     18              And then I have already prepared a summary

     19    report of my state of the art opinions, which of course

     20    do not change with a given case.  So I insert all of

     21    those and then submit it.  Is that what you're asking me?

     22    I'm not sure.

     23         Q.   Yes.

     24         A.   Okay.

     25         Q.   Do you have any updates to this report since






                                                                   12




      1    you initially created it in September of 2018?

      2         A.   I think, and I'm sorry, Leah, I don't know the

      3    exact date, but it seems to me that I updated my generic

      4    report for both Westinghouse and GE, which of course are

      5    not focused on Mr. Drummond's specific case, but some of

      6    that information would come from those updated reports.

      7    Which if I'm correct, I think was at the end of '18 and

      8    beginning of '19 I think.  I'd have to check.  I didn't

      9    bring those reports with me.

     10              So there may have been some updates, but I

     11    don't think any of it would conflict with the substance

     12    of this report.

     13         Q.   Okay.  I would like to mark your report as

     14    Exhibit 1 to the deposition so we know what we're

     15    referring to.

     17         Identification.)

     18    BY MS. MCMORRIS:

     19         Q.   So am I understanding you correctly that none

     20    of your opinions as to GE or Westinghouse has changed

     21    since this report was drafted?

     22         A.   That's correct.

     23         Q.   Do you estimate giving any state of the art

     24    opinions that are not included in this report?

     25         A.   I certainly don't anticipate it.  I try in






                                                                   13




      1    these summary reports to address most, if not all, of the

      2    issues that I would expect to be asked about.

      3              Having said that, I know I've been in

      4    situations where either plaintiff or defense counsel have

      5    asked me specific questions that I might know about

      6    historically for example that I didn't include.  So if

      7    that came up, I would hope to be able to answer the

      8    question.  But I've tried the best I could to summarize

      9    all that I would expect to be asked about in this report.

     10              MR. SPEZIALI:  Leah, this is Dave Speziali.  I

     11         can send you, if you gave me an e-mail address, I

     12         call them generic reports.  There were updates to

     13         those.  If you'd like, I can get them to you now or

     14         later at some point or through Cathy.

     15              MS. MCMORRIS:  Okay.  If you wouldn't mind

     16         e-mailing, that would be great.

     17              MR. SPEZIALI:  I think is your e-mail available

     18         on your website?  If it is, I'll just get it from

     19         there.

     20              MS. MCMORRIS:  It is.

     21              MR. SPEZIALI:  Go ahead.

     22              MS. MCMORRIS:  Cathy has it as well.

     23              MR. SPEZIALI:  All right.  I'll find it.

     24              MS. MCMORRIS:  All right.  Thank you.

      1    BY MS. MCMORRIS:

      2         Q.   So from reading the materials that you were

      3    provided in this case, is it your understanding that

      4    Mr. Drummond was suffering from pleural mesothelioma?

      5         A.   Yes.  I think he had a variety of medical

      6    conditions, but pertinent most to our discussion today is

      7    that he developed a malignant pleural mesothelioma, which

      8    I believe was likely related to past occupational

      9    exposure to asbestos.

     10         Q.   And you just touched on, as mentioned in your

     11    report, a number of variables that need to be considered

     12    when determining the degree to which a given exposure

     13    contributes to an asbestos related disease.  Is that

     14    correct?

     15         A.   Yes.

     16         Q.   And some of these factors that you mentioned

     17    include the proximity of exposure, duration of exposure,

     18    frequency, fiber type and there are several others listed

     19    in the report that you frequently mention.  Correct?

     20         A.   Correct.

     21         Q.   So after reading Mr. Drummond's deposition and

     22    reviewing his medical records, do you have any opinions

     23    regarding the variables during his work at the Fore River

     24    Shipyard in general?

     25         A.   Well, I believe certainly in his early years of






                                                                   15




      1    employment from '56 through probably '71 I read about

      2    working in a shipyard arena, which certainly I think

      3    would provide opportunities for exposure.

      4              My earlier comments about GE and Westinghouse

      5    just had to do with a lack of very specific recollection

      6    of those variables including whether asbestos was

      7    involved and things like that.

      8              But I think from his description and my

      9    knowledge of the shipyard setting, especially in the

     10    early years, I think without giving you exact references,

     11    I took from it there were certainly opportunities for

     12    exposure in the shipyard that would have led and did lead

     13    in my opinion to the conclusion that I expressed earlier

     14    that it was likely related to asbestos.

     15         Q.   Were there any specific exposures that you were

     16    able to identify that contributed to his mesothelioma?

     17         A.   As I pointed out in the report and I'll answer

     18    up front no is the answer in that many of those details

     19    are lacking.

     20              But, again, knowing the extensive use and the

     21    period of time that he was there and the description that

     22    he gave, I think generally it's fair to conclude that the

     23    general exposure through that arena would have been

     24    enough to attribute the causation conclusion too that I

     25    mentioned.






                                                                   16




      1         Q.   Okay.  Do you have any opinions regarding any

      2    particular product or manufacturer's responsibility for

      3    Mr. Drummond's development of mesothelioma?

      4         A.   Well, certainly not specific manufacturers.

      5    But, again, as I rendered in the report, most pleural

      6    mesothelioma currently have to do with remote exposure,

      7    which often involves thermal insulation.

      8              I mentioned other types of exposure in the

      9    report, but the vast majority have to do with thermal

     10    insulation products.

     11              So, generally, again knowing the extensive use

     12    of those in the shipyard setting, especially in the 50s,

     13    I would say that that as a product is the most likely.

     14    But as far as a specific exposure I don't think that you

     15    can accurately conclude that.

     16         Q.   In addition to thermal insulation, are there

     17    any other products in this case that you believe may have

     18    contributed to Mr. Drummond's mesothelioma?

     19         A.   Well, my focus again was on GE and

     20    Westinghouse.  I can't -- and especially I didn't review

     21    a year after I rendered the report those other types of

     22    exposures.  I mentioned certainly brake and I think

     23    drywall in my report, but I can't recall any specific

     24    product or type of product.

     25              Thermal insulation overwhelmingly is the most






                                                                   17




      1    likely.  I know he mentioned gaskets and other things in

      2    the shipyard, but, as I recall, overwhelmingly it was

      3    thermal insulation that I thought was the culprit.

      4         Q.   Did your review of Mr. Drummond's deposition

      5    suggest to you one way or the other that he was exposed

      6    to asbestos while working around General Electric

      7    equipment?

      8         A.   No.  Again, I thought he did not recall

      9    specific exposure.  He made it very clear he didn't

     10    work -- he never worked directly on turbines.  The

     11    turbine manufacturers that he was able to recall I didn't

     12    see was specific to General Electric or Westinghouse.

     13              The specific recollection on Westinghouse

     14    regarding forced draft blowers, I think even when

     15    questioned he couldn't specifically say it was asbestos.

     16    And in my experience many of those are not insulated.

     17              So I thought there were many variables there

     18    that would not allow me to specifically conclude that

     19    exposure to Westinghouse or GE products were the culprit,

     20    no.

     21         Q.   Did either Westinghouse or General Electric

     22    provide you any documents regarding the insulation,

     23    thermal insulation products that were used on the

     24    Sherman-class destroyers built at the Fore River

     25    Shipyard?






                                                                   18




      1         A.   No.

      2         Q.   Were you provided with any information about

      3    the asbestos content of the insulation used on this

      4    turbine on the Sherman-class destroyers?

      5         A.   No, certainly not.  I'm aware generally of

      6    various manufacturers and generally of the content, but

      7    not specifically in this case, no.

      8         Q.   So same question for the forced draft blowers,

      9    were you provided with any information about the asbestos

     10    content of insulation used on the forced draft blowers on

     11    the Sherman-class destroyers?

     12         A.   No, just the uncertainty mentioned in the

     13    deposition.  So other than that, no.

     14         Q.   Okay.  What is your general understanding of

     15    the insulation used on those types of equipment on Navy

     16    vessels during the 1950s?

     17         A.   Well, I'm certain that's out of my field of

     18    expertise, but I've seen descriptions from a variety of

     19    sources that primarily focuses on the piping that could

     20    be attached to the turbine.  Oftentimes there is a

     21    blanket referenced on the top of the turbine.  But we're

     22    getting beyond my field of expertise.

     23              I would refer to his description of the process

     24    and then certainly my knowledge of extensive use on

     25    piping within the vessel typically in shipyards






                                                                   19




      1    historically.

      2         Q.   If you were provided any information showing

      3    that the insulation on General Electric or Westinghouse

      4    equipment on the Sherman-class destroyers was asbestos

      5    containing, would that in any way change your opinion

      6    regarding Mr. Drummond's exposure?

      7         A.   Well, if I understand your question, it would

      8    involve that specific exposure that he experienced.  So I

      9    did mention in my report that, for example, if you were

     10    to provide evidence that his exposure on that vessel and

     11    that turbine involved asbestos containing thermal

     12    insulation and there was evidence of all those other

     13    variables in terms of more than just walking by, he was

     14    actually there when exposure was ongoing, I think from

     15    his description I'm confident that at most it would have

     16    been bystander exposure.

     17              But, historically, certainly if that was

     18    present and it was asbestos containing thermal

     19    insulation, then I would certainly be able to conclude

     20    that that might have added to the causative exposures

     21    that he experienced.

     22         Q.   In your report you detail a number of general

     23    state of the art opinions.  And I don't want to go

     24    through all those because I think they're laid out pretty

     25    well in your report.






                                                                   20




      1              But do you have any additional opinions about

      2    the general state of the art that are not included in

      3    your report?

      4         A.   So I understood your previous question to be

      5    similar.  And, again, I don't think so, but certainly if

      6    you ask me something that was outside of this -- of what

      7    was covered here and I knew about it, I would certainly

      8    try to answer that.

      9              But I don't anticipate -- I think I've tried to

     10    cover from my knowledge and my experience what questions

     11    are most pertinent to both sides.

     12         Q.   Do you have any opinions specific to the Navy

     13    knowledge regarding the hazards of asbestos in the 1950s?

     14         A.   Well, I don't consider myself a Navy expert.

     15    I'm not a Navy veteran, I've never worked for the Navy in

     16    a shipyard.  So in that regard, no.

     17              But I've tried to include in my report based

     18    predominately on published medical literature I believe

     19    the sophistication of the Navy in the development of this

     20    so called state of the art knowledge base.

     21              From the very beginning I cited the Fleischer

     22    Drinker report for example and then Captain Brown's

     23    publication both in the 40s that detail I think processes

     24    that the Navy had in place to try to address asbestos.

     25              And so I would -- I think I referenced what I'm






                                                                   21




      1    thinking of in response to your question in the report

      2    and I would expect to reflect on those publications,

      3    Fleischer Drinker, the Brown publication, the Marr

      4    publication all referenced I think in my report.

      5              You know, certainly the Navy was involved with

      6    Walsh-Healy requirements, the minimum standards I

      7    referenced.  So off the top I'm thinking that those are

      8    all in response to what I would expect to render

      9    concerning your question about Navy knowledge.

     10         Q.   Do you have any information specific to

     11    Bethlehem Steel's knowledge regarding the hazards of

     12    asbestos in the 1950s?

     13         A.   No.

     14         Q.   When Mr. Drummond began working at the Fore

     15    River Shipyard in 1956, what was the general state of the

     16    art at that time?

     17         A.   Well, as I initiated in my report, the

     18    knowledge base I believe regarding the potential hazards

     19    of asbestos began prior to that in the 1930s, late 20s if

     20    you look at case reports.

     21              So certainly by the 50s there was a base of

     22    medical literature that utilized peer review published

     23    epidemiologic studies showing in predominately textile

     24    factory arenas that with prolonged and intense and direct

     25    exposure some of those individuals would develop scarring






                                                                   22




      1    within the lung, which was referred to as asbestosis.

      2              Certainly, I think your question was in the 50s

      3    by.  By the 40s we now have both Captain Brown's

      4    publication and maybe more importantly the Fleischer

      5    Drinker study published in '46 that indicated a number of

      6    processes were in place.

      7              And the significance of the Fleischer Drinker

      8    study I believe was that it represented the first

      9    epidemiologic study outside of the textile factory arena

     10    that concluded in part that this field of marine

     11    insulation at that time with those processes in place was

     12    not a dangerous occupation.

     13              Certainly, the state of the art at that time

     14    also involved the role of the ACGIH and the utilization

     15    of some of those studies from the 30s to initiate a dust

     16    control level that was established and promulgated across

     17    the country to try to void and prevent any adverse

     18    outcome, which as noted at that time was asbestosis.

     19              So that gets us I think to the 50s, which is I

     20    think where you asked me.  So by 1956 certainly it was

     21    acknowledged that in certain circumstances asbestos could

     22    result in scarring of the lung and there were efforts to

     23    minimize dust production at least to that level that was

     24    promulgated as a level that below which adverse outcomes

     25    would not occur.  All of that was in place by the 1950s.






                                                                   23




      1         Q.   These efforts to minimize dust production

      2    levels, what were some of those efforts that were in

      3    place in the 1950s?

      4         A.   Well, when you read the publications, both the

      5    Brown publication that I mentioned in 1941, as well as

      6    the Fleischer Drinker study in 1946, they especially

      7    specific to this case they talk about processes that the

      8    Navy had in various locations and with various levels of

      9    compliance that involved ventilation, dust suppression

     10    techniques and even the use of respirator type devices.

     11    In some they mentioned wet methods, which would be

     12    occasionally utilized.  I think those are predominately

     13    the engineering categories that are cited at that time.

     14         Q.   Do you have any knowledge whether or not any of

     15    those dust minimization efforts that you just described

     16    were being used at the Fore River Shipyard?

     17         A.   I certainly don't have any personal knowledge.

     18    I would reflect -- and I haven't done this in preparation

     19    for this so I can't cite it directly, but as I mentioned

     20    in my report the Fore River Shipyard was one of those

     21    surveyed by the Fleischer Drinker study.

     22              So to specifically answer I would have to look

     23    at the language there, but I don't know off the top I'm

     24    sorry.  And I'm not suggesting that those measures were

     25    preventative to the subsequent development of a






                                                                   24




      1    mesothelioma, the knowledge of that of course comes in

      2    the future well beyond 1956 in my opinion.

      3         Q.   In your reading of Mr. Drummond's deposition

      4    testimony, did you see any indication that any of those

      5    dust suppression techniques were being used at Fore River

      6    during Mr. Drummond's time there?

      7         A.   No.  But I don't recall anybody specifically

      8    asking him about ventilation and things like that.  But

      9    to answer your question, no.

     10         Q.   Do you have any information regarding General

     11    Electric or Westinghouse's contemporaneous knowledge of

     12    awareness, knowledge or awareness, excuse me, of what

     13    Bethlehem Steel knew about the hazards of asbestos during

     14    Mr. Drummond's time there?

     15         A.   Specifically regarding Bethlehem Steel,

     16    absolutely not.  I do have some knowledge and certainly

     17    expectations regarding the published medical literature

     18    and what I would expect and in some cases know that the

     19    corporation would know about that information certainly

     20    being part of organizations which promulgate those

     21    conclusions from the published literature I think is

     22    evident in this case.

     23              And maybe this is getting too far afield, but

     24    certainly my knowledge about Alice Hamilton and her role

     25    with GE historically would I think partially address






                                                                   25




      1    that.  But I have no knowledge about what the corporate

      2    knowledge about Bethlehem Steel's knowledge would be, it

      3    would be more aimed at the published medical literature.

      4         Q.   In your report you express an opinion that,

      5    trying to find the correct paragraph here:  "The absence

      6    of caution labels associated with General Electric or

      7    Westinghouse cannot be deemed a proximate cause of

      8    Mr. Drummond's exposure to asbestos."

      9              Do you see that reference?  I think it's on the

     10    third page.

     11         A.   I don't -- let me see if I can find it.  I

     12    recall the reference, let's see if I can find it.  I may

     13    not need to find it.  Go ahead and ask.  I recall the

     14    reference.

     15         Q.   The question is what is the basis for your

     16    opinion?

     17         A.   Well, so specifically regarding whether warning

     18    labels on a GE or a Westinghouse product in this case

     19    would have probably changed anybody's behavior.

     20              In most cases I don't have a specific quote

     21    from the plaintiff.  In this case Mr. Drummond was

     22    specifically asked whether or not that information would

     23    have changed him and I think I included that in my

     24    report.  He clearly stated that it would not.

     25              In most cases my conclusion, and in this one as






                                                                   26




      1    well, is in part based on a number of variables including

      2    their described work.

      3              So the fact that he didn't work directly on

      4    those products, along with the fact that the products in

      5    question here are predominately thermal insulation as

      6    noted throughout a period of time that he worked in that

      7    arena did have warnings on them.  As well as certainly

      8    the sophistication and the knowledge of the Navy, which I

      9    referenced earlier.

     10              It wouldn't have been that that kind of

     11    information would have educated the Navy or likely based

     12    on his own response have any impact on what

     13    Mr. Drummond's activity was.

     14         Q.   Is that your opinion the same opinion regarding

     15    what you just testified for the Navy, is it also your

     16    opinion that these warning labels would not have impacted

     17    the shipyard in any manner?

     18         A.   Correct, yes.

     19         Q.   So is it your opinion that neither GE or

     20    Westinghouse made an affirmative decision not to warn

     21    because they were aware of the shipyard or the Navy's

     22    investigation regarding the hazards of asbestos?

     23         A.   Well, I can't really speak specifically to what

     24    was underneath that decision, but certainly they were

     25    aware and in many instances it would be based again on






                                                                   27




      1    published medical literature, as well as experience, that

      2    number one as I think was pointed out in a deposition the

      3    forced draft blowers and in this case the turbines would

      4    typically be delivered without asbestos.

      5              The asbestos that the Navy decided to

      6    subsequently apply would have in many cases had warnings

      7    already on it.

      8              So in part that knowledge of the processes that

      9    are in place and probably that many products that were

     10    available and in use at that time, which were I don't

     11    believe mandated to use, did have warning labels already

     12    on them.

     13              So I think speculating a little bit that all of

     14    those factors would certainly play into that decision, as

     15    well as the fact that your product does not contain

     16    asbestos.

     17         Q.   And you mentioned some of the controls that

     18    were in place affecting shipyards during this time

     19    period.  And I believe you cited to the minimum

     20    requirements for safety of industrial health for

     21    shipyards in the Walsh-Healey Act.

     22              Are there any other that apply specifically to

     23    the Fore River Shipyard during that time period?

     24         A.   Well, certainly the ACGIH.  And I guess not a

     25    requirement, but my understanding is that the vast






                                                                   28




      1    majority of states embraced the recommended threshold

      2    limit value.  So what the legal requirement of specific

      3    shipyard was regarding that I can't really address, but I

      4    think that also would at least speak to the processes in

      5    place.

      6              Other than that, I think the two things that

      7    you mentioned certainly are pertinent to that.  Along

      8    with certainly the published literature that I spoke to

      9    earlier.  That's somewhat of a unique variable in this

     10    case.  So I think that's all I'm thinking of in answering

     11    that.

     12         Q.   And specific to the Walsh-Healey Act, was that

     13    applicable to product manufacturers such as General

     14    Electric and Westinghouse as well as shipyards?

     15         A.   We're getting outside of my field here.  My

     16    understanding is a federal employee was Walsh-Healy Act

     17    involved federal contracts beyond a certain economic

     18    level and then it required a variety of actions be taken,

     19    which included adherence to the five million particle per

     20    cubic foot level in the 50s I recall.

     21              But as far as specific requirements and legal

     22    requirements of a corporation versus a shipyard, I don't

     23    know.  My understanding as a physician was that it

     24    applied to all federal contracts over a certain dollar

     25    amount.






                                                                   29




      1         Q.   And so the federal contract, is it your

      2    understanding that was just between the Navy and a

      3    shipyard and not necessarily including product

      4    manufacturers?  I'm just trying to understand your

      5    opinion.

      6         A.   Okay.  Again, I'm not an expert on the

      7    contractual situation.  My understanding was if you

      8    signed a federal contract, whoever you are, General

      9    Electric, Westinghouse or a shipyard that involved more

     10    than I thought it was $10,000, but I'm not sure of that,

     11    then you would be obligated to follow this -- these rules

     12    of engagement.  That's the extent of my knowledge.

     13              I just know from reading it that it embraced

     14    the five million particle which becomes very pertinent to

     15    what I testify about speaking again to the widespread

     16    adoption both in federal and in state jurisdictions to

     17    that level as being a credible effort to do the best that

     18    we could with the knowledge that we had at a specific

     19    time to prevent adverse outcomes.  That's the extent of

     20    my knowledge of that.

     21         Q.   In what way do the requirements imposed upon

     22    the Fore River Shipyard through the Walsh-Healey Act or

     23    the minimum standards contribute to your opinion that the

     24    Fore River Shipyard was highly sophisticated regarding

     25    asbestos safety?






                                                                   30




      1         A.   Well, my understanding of your previous

      2    question that led to that label of highly sophisticated

      3    had to do with the Navy.

      4              The shipyard in terms of the Walsh-Healey Act

      5    in my opinion it speaks to the question that frequently

      6    comes up about the legitimacy of the five million

      7    particle per cubic foot level.

      8              Clearly people were not embracing that in an

      9    effort to cause harm to people.  And when that position

     10    is taken, I think citing federal endorsement of it

     11    through the Walsh-Healey Act and then state endorsement

     12    of it tends to minimize the legitimacy of that argument.

     13              So beyond that, the legal sophistication of the

     14    shipyard I'm not personally aware of.  I was speaking

     15    primarily of where the Navy's involvement from the very

     16    beginning of this period of time, specifically the 40s,

     17    in investigating and knowing about the potential hazards

     18    of asbestos.

     19         Q.   In the third page of your report there is a

     20    statement stating:  "The Fore River Shipyard was highly

     21    sophisticated regarding asbestos safety starting with the

     22    requirements imposed upon it by the government

     23    regulations including the minimum standards and the

     24    Walsh-Healey Act."  That's what I was referencing.  Do

     25    you see that in your report?






                                                                   31




      1         A.   Yes.  What I think I'm addressing is thinking

      2    that the Fore River Shipyard is affiliated with the Navy

      3    and the Navy is certainly knowledgeable and obligated and

      4    endorsing those ideas and the base of the knowledge for

      5    it.

      6              So maybe I shouldn't separate the Fore River

      7    Shipyard as an entity from the Navy.  I'm just thinking

      8    the Navy is there and predominately he's working on naval

      9    vessels.  So I'm assuming there's going to be some cross

     10    pollination of that knowledge base.  I'm just not

     11    specifically knowledgeable about the non Navy functioning

     12    of the Fore River Shipyard.

     13         Q.   Do you have an understanding of whether or not

     14    the Fore River Shipyard was a Navy shipyard versus a

     15    contract shipyard?

     16         A.   No, I don't know the makeup there.  I just

     17    thought from the description in this case that it was

     18    heavily involved with the Navy, especially during the

     19    period of time that Mr. Drummond was there.  So I don't

     20    know the legal makeup or the specific corporate entity

     21    makeup of the shipyard.

     22         Q.   Would it change your opinion at all if the Fore

     23    River Shipyard was a privately owned shipyard as opposed

     24    to a Navy shipyard?

     25         A.   I don't think so.  In those cases that I've






                                                                   32




      1    been involved with, if it was a totally non Navy

      2    operation, then typically the shipyard has been involved

      3    with organizations like the National Safety Council and

      4    Industrial Hygiene Foundation, things like that where

      5    information is passed.  And as mentioned earlier, the

      6    ACGIH with state adoption of various dust control limits.

      7              Usually, if the Navy is not involved, I've done

      8    the work to try to figure out what the corporate entity

      9    was guided by in a given state.  I'm just assuming in

     10    this case there was heavy Navy involvement.  He made that

     11    clear from his testimony as well.  So that's kind of

     12    where my thought process is regarding the sophistication.

     13         Q.   And would that sophistication for a private

     14    shipyard such as the Fore River Shipyard be the same as

     15    what a corporation such as General Electric or

     16    Westinghouse would have had available to them?

     17         A.   Well, most of what I refer to and the

     18    publications that I've referred to here, including all

     19    the ACGIH information and state regulations and federal

     20    regulations, are all publicly available.

     21              So if your workplace is addressed, it's

     22    pertinent to know and I would expect an operation to be

     23    aware of what was in those sources of information from

     24    peer reviewed published literature, to state regulations,

     25    to federal law that addressed your operation.  I would






                                                                   33




      1    certainly expect them to know about that.

      2         Q.   So changing gears here a little bit.  You did

      3    review medical records of Mr. Drummond from this 2016 to

      4    2018 time period; is that correct?  Let me see if I can

      5    find it here.

      6         A.   Leah, I'm sorry, I was still thinking about

      7    your last question and I looked through my report.  In

      8    citations four and five I think I addressed some of what

      9    you asked me about, including of course the previously

     10    noted reference that the Fore River Shipyard was one of

     11    the original yards surveyed in that Fleischer Drinker

     12    report.

     13              So I guess specific to this case I would look

     14    at citation four and five to address some of those

     15    sophistication questions.  I'm sorry, I got distracted by

     16    that and I forgot or missed your most recent question.

     17         Q.   That's okay.  I was going to change gears on

     18    you here and talk about Mr. Drummond's medical records

     19    that you reviewed.

     20              Is it correct that the records that you

     21    reviewed were from 2016 to 2017?

     22         A.   Yes.

     23         Q.   Okay.  And what did your review of his medical

     24    record suggest to you regarding his diagnosis of

     25    mesothelioma?






                                                                   34




      1         A.   Well, I believe it confirmed it.  I usually am

      2    asked to review the records to weigh in on the legitimacy

      3    of the diagnosis and in this case I think it was totally

      4    and completely legitimate to do what they did and I'm

      5    certainly supportive of the diagnosis.

      6         Q.   I'm just going to review my notes briefly here,

      7    but I think I'm just about finished.  When you're

      8    reviewing a case like this and the medical records that

      9    you were provided, is there -- do you have a method to

     10    differentiate between an exposure that you believe is

     11    causative and contributes to disease or one that does

     12    not?

     13         A.   I usually don't get that from the medical

     14    records.  But there are some variables that I look to and

     15    in this case there was evidence of pleural plaques

     16    formation, which also attests to the deposition claim of

     17    occupational exposure to asbestos.

     18              So specific to this case that was an indicator

     19    in my opinion supportive of Mr. Drummond's testimony and

     20    what I knew about the workplace that supported that this

     21    was an asbestos related mesothelioma.

     22              But most of the time and in most situations

     23    regarding your question, it's gleaned more from the

     24    deposition testimony of the workplace and the exposure

     25    than it is the medical record.  I, you know, with






                                                                   35




      1    mesothelioma many are non occupational -- non

      2    occupationally related, but you can't determine that in

      3    most cases from the medical records.

      4         Q.   Did you see anything in your review of

      5    Mr. Drummond's medical records that you disagreed with

      6    treatment wise, diagnosis wise or anything just in

      7    general that you disagreed with?

      8         A.   Not in his medical records if that's the focus

      9    of your question.  The only thing I can think of, and I

     10    don't think it was a conclusion, but one of the entries

     11    listed a history of asbestosis and that certainly was not

     12    supported throughout his clinical record that I reviewed.

     13    That was not a diagnosis that his treating physicians had

     14    reached.

     15              But that was just one entry, it was in a list

     16    of historical diagnosis so I wouldn't know what they had

     17    based that on.  And it certainly was not supported by his

     18    clinical records.

     19         Q.   But is it your opinion that his clinical

     20    records did support a diagnosis of asbestosis at some

     21    point?

     22         A.   No, not the ones that I reviewed.  No, they did

     23    not.  That is noted on a death certificate, but there are

     24    other significant inaccuracies in the death certificate.

     25    So I think the clinical records did not conclude that he






                                                                   36




      1    had asbestosis.  They did include that he had

      2    mesothelioma of course.

      3         Q.   In your review of the death certificate, what

      4    are the inaccuracies in your opinion?

      5         A.   Well, the most glaring ones are the list of

      6    metastatic lung cancer followed by asbestosis.  I don't

      7    believe the clinical records that I reviewed supported

      8    either conclusion.

      9         Q.   And why is that?

     10         A.   Well, hopefully we can agree here today that

     11    lung cancer is not mesothelioma.  They are totally

     12    distinct entities that really have little, if anything,

     13    to do with each other.  So I saw nothing in his record

     14    that this gentleman had had lung cancer.

     15              And, again, asbestosis is a diagnosis based on

     16    a variety of things, predominately the radiographic

     17    findings and the radiographic reports that I saw along

     18    with the clinical conclusions by his treating doctors did

     19    not diagnose him with that.  So those are the two most

     20    glaring ones.

     21              I guess from your perspective I would conclude

     22    that the absence of mesothelioma on his death certificate

     23    is an obvious error as well in my opinion.

     24         Q.   Any other errors that you see on the death

     25    certificate?






                                                                   37




      1         A.   I don't think so.

      2         Q.   All right.  Are there any additional opinions

      3    in your report or outside of your report that we have not

      4    discussed today that you anticipate having opinions about

      5    if you were to testify in trial in this case?

      6         A.   Without a specific question, I can't add to

      7    what we already talked about in anticipation of those

      8    questions.  So, no, I don't.

      9         Q.   I think that's all I have for you, Dr. Howard.

     10         A.   All right.  Thank you, Leah.

     11         Q.   Thank you.

     12              MR. SPEZIALI:  Leah, this is Dave.  Well, first

     13         off, let me mention this.  I sent you the e-mail

     14         just now.

     15              MS. MCMORRIS:  Okay.

     16              MR. SPEZIALI:  If you wanted to take a minute

     17         and look at those, that's totally your call.  We can

     18         certainly take whatever amount kind of break you

     19         need.  Those are generic reports.  I don't think

     20         you're going to find a lot there different, but you

     21         certainly might.

     22              Is there anybody else on the phone that wants

     23         to ask questions?  I don't even know if anybody else

     24         is on the phone.

     25              MS. MCMORRIS:  I don't think there is.






                                                                   38




      1              MR. SPEZIALI:  Did you want to take a few

      2         minutes and take a look at those?  It's totally your

      3         call.

      4              MS. MCMORRIS:  Sure.  It will probably take me

      5         two minutes to scroll through it and compare to what

      6         I have and see if there's anything that's different

      7         and worth mentioning.

      8              MR. SPEZIALI:  Did the e-mail come through?

      9              MS. MCMORRIS:  It did, I just got it.

     10              MR. SPEZIALI:  Okay.  Wait a few minutes.  And

     11         then I may or may not have a couple questions, but

     12         let's see where it goes.  We'll give it let's say

     13         ten minutes, quarter after.

     14              MS. MCMORRIS:  Okay.

     15              (A break was taken.)

     16              MR. SPEZIALI:  Did you have any more questions?

     17              MS. MCMORRIS:  I just have one follow-up.

     18    BY MS. MCMORRIS:

     19         Q.   Is it your opinion that neither the Navy or

     20    Bethlehem Steel appreciated the risk of exposure to

     21    bystanders during the time period that Mr. Drummond

     22    worked at the Fore River Shipyard?

     23              MR. SPEZIALI:  Objection to form.  Go ahead,

     24         Doc.

     25         A.   So, again, I don't know the specific basis for






                                                                   39




      1    Bethlehem Steel.  I would expect everybody to look to the

      2    medical literature to try to answer that.

      3              Certainly, in terms of exposure, I think there

      4    would be general understanding, which is not unique to

      5    asbestos, that certainly there is likely to be exposure.

      6    The question certainly has to do with the expected

      7    development of adverse outcomes and that throughout this

      8    period of time was felt not to occur if the level of

      9    exposure was be below a certain range.

     10              And certainly at this point, '56 to '62 in

     11    particular, I don't know of any epidemiologic based

     12    knowledge that would in any way suggest bystanders were

     13    at risk of disease.  I think there would be just a

     14    general understanding that there might be minimal

     15    exposure the further you get from a focal point.

     16              But, again, the point of dust production, the

     17    target was five million particles and below that adverse

     18    effects would not occur.

     19              So clearly it was not perceived nor reported

     20    that bystanders were at risk of getting any disease,

     21    especially mesothelioma.

     22         Q.   And so that risk, therefore, would not have

     23    been appreciated by either the Navy or Bethlehem Steel?

     24         A.   Oh, maybe I misunderstood.  I mean the risk of

     25    exposure to me is different than the risk of adverse






                                                                   40




      1    outcome from that exposure.  So, again, I don't know the

      2    specific answer for Bethlehem Steel.

      3              I would expect and certainly from all the

      4    processes in place with the Navy they were aware that

      5    there was a risk of exposure, but not a risk of disease

      6    to bystanders at that period of time.

      7              MS. MCMORRIS:  Okay.  Thank you.  I think

      8         that's all I have.

      9              MR. SPEZIALI:  This is Dave.  I just have a

     10         couple quick questions.

     11                        CROSS EXAMINATION

     12    BY MR. SPEZIALI:

     13         Q.   Dr. Howard, for purposes of my questions,

     14    although you've made it clear it's not reflected in the

     15    testimony, let's just assume that insulation materials

     16    used in conjunction with the products at issue for

     17    General Electric and/or Westinghouse were asbestos

     18    containing.  Okay.  Just assume that for the purposes of

     19    my question.

     20         A.   Okay.

     21         Q.   Okay.  For the time period for the activities

     22    described by Mr. Drummond and as you reflected in your

     23    report and your testimony today, would there have been

     24    reason for General Electric or Westinghouse to know or

     25    have reason or belief that exposure to asbestos






                                                                   41




      1    insulation materials in conjunction with those products

      2    would have been dangerous for Mr. Drummond during the

      3    timeframes we're talking about?

      4         A.   No.  And I was trying to answer that with

      5    Leah's last question I think.  Certainly the state of the

      6    art at that period of time '56 through '62 was clearly

      7    not that a bystander, if in fact that occurred, the type

      8    of exposure to thermal insulation was likely to cause any

      9    adverse outcome.  So no.

     10         Q.   All right.  And let's again just for purposes

     11    of this question -- and I understand your opinions, and I

     12    understand why your -- when you say through '62, you're

     13    focusing on Mr. Drummond's apprenticeship years; is that

     14    right?

     15         A.   Yes.  There was a little bit of confusion

     16    beyond that because it was active military career.  But

     17    that's why I chose that period of time.

     18         Q.   Okay.  And that's fine.  But let's just assume

     19    for purposes of our discussion so that there is no

     20    question as to where your opinions stand, we know that

     21    his career went through '71 and I recognize that his

     22    testimony differs substantially from his apprentice years

     23    to his later years.

     24              But if we expanded the question to include the

     25    period up through '71, in that timeframe again is there






                                                                   42




      1    any reason to believe or know that the types of exposures

      2    that he describes would have created dangers for him in

      3    terms of insulation materials on the General Electric or

      4    Westinghouse products discussed in this case?

      5         A.   No.  He made it clear that at most we're

      6    talking about what most of us would refer to as bystander

      7    type exposure.  So he's not the one involved in

      8    insulating for example.

      9              But if there was thermal insulation involved in

     10    these exposures that it contained asbestos and he was

     11    exposed in a bystander fashion, then to answer your

     12    question through '71 for sure bystanders were not

     13    perceived to be likely or at risk of developing disease.

     14              Many publications said in that time period that

     15    there are others who may experience exposures, but until

     16    we know that exposure is a problem or above a level that

     17    is considered a problem, it would be inaccurate to assume

     18    or conclude that all of those people are at risk of

     19    disease.  Certainly there would be some other who are

     20    exposed.

     21              And this concept is not at all unique to

     22    asbestos.  It's a dose response relationship that applies

     23    to just about any product or element.  Oxygen is always

     24    the one I think about when asked that question.  But dose

     25    response means that just because you have some exposure,






                                                                   43




      1    which by the way all of us have had, that does not mean

      2    that you have a higher incidence of disease because of

      3    that exposure.

      4         Q.   And in at least through '71, what was the

      5    prevailing threshold limit value that was -- that was

      6    established for asbestos through that timeframe?

      7         A.   So throughout that time period starting

      8    actually in the 1940s, the threshold limit value was five

      9    million particles per cubic foot.

     10              At the very end of the time period that you're

     11    asking me about, there were suggestions by some to alter

     12    the TLV and that occurred I believe in the late '71,

     13    early '72 time period.

     14              Now that was multifactorial in part related to

     15    a change in the methodology for measuring dust rather

     16    than particles going to fibers.  But it was also based on

     17    developing literature that showed that the threshold

     18    limit value may need to be reduced, which of course it

     19    was.

     20         Q.   Right.  And without revisiting and spending a

     21    lot more time here, did both Dr. Selikoff and Doctors

     22    Balzer and Cooper address the idea regarding hands on

     23    insulator exposures versus bystanders that you described

     24    in publications in the 60s and 70s?

     25         A.   Yes.  Absolutely focused on the insulator






                                                                   44




      1    population.  With of course some comments made by one of

      2    those authors about maybe we'll need to investigate other

      3    people, which it subsequently in his career and

      4    historically later on they did to try to determine if in

      5    fact there was a risk of disease.

      6         Q.   And I understand from your report that you have

      7    actually met and discussed with Dr. Balzer his research

      8    in the 60s and 70s; is that correct?

      9         A.   That is correct.

     10         Q.   All right.  I want to ask you one other thing.

     11    You were asked a lot of questions about the Navy's

     12    knowledge and the shipyard's knowledge.

     13              Let me ask you this.  Again, let's just assume

     14    for purposes of my questions and I understand it's --

     15    let's just assume it, that Mr. Drummond is working with

     16    asbestos insulation materials during the period that he

     17    testified to in the shipyards for '56 through '71.

     18              That he -- again just assume that his testimony

     19    was that he's working at Fore River and that he's working

     20    on Navy ships, okay, just as he testified to.

     21         A.   Okay.

     22         Q.   And let's assume that those are asbestos

     23    containing materials being used by insulators in and

     24    around him.  Okay.  Just assume all that.

     25         A.   Okay.






                                                                   45




      1         Q.   Would there have been reason -- if all that

      2    were occurring, would there have been reason for

      3    Westinghouse and General Electric to believe that

      4    Mr. Drummond would have been advised of any dangers in

      5    association with asbestos in his work and would have been

      6    advised of any precautions to take regarding exposures to

      7    asbestos in association with his exposures in work as he

      8    described?

      9              MS. MCMORRIS:  Objection, form.

     10    BY MR. SPEZIALI:

     11         Q.   Do you follow that?

     12         A.   I think so.  I'm reflecting back on one of

     13    Leah's earlier questions.  The wealth of publicly

     14    available peer reviewed medical literature comes to mind,

     15    which certainly supports throughout this period of time

     16    that the Navy had in place as mentioned with variable

     17    degrees of compliance a variety of measures which they

     18    cited from the very beginning with the published

     19    Fleischer Drinker study.  I mentioned Captain Brown's

     20    publication as well in the 40s and then Marr's

     21    publication in '64.

     22              Those all come to mind immediately when you ask

     23    that question in that we have a variety of processes

     24    allegedly utilized by the Navy and reported in the

     25    medical literature that would suggest that communication,






                                                                   46




      1    if you will, that there is a potential in addressing this

      2    fiber or these products and that has to be communicated

      3    in order for -- for this to be taking place, which is

      4    published.

      5              So in addition to the published medical

      6    literature, you know, the involvement of the National

      7    Safety Council, the ACGIH, the minimum standards that we

      8    talked about, all of these to me would support the idea

      9    that processes are utilized, which would require that

     10    communication.

     11              Not that I would expect the individual sailor

     12    to know specifics about the diseases in question or

     13    anything like that, but that would communicate some of

     14    the potential for hazard, which I think you can assume

     15    has to take place.

     16         Q.   All right.  So you mentioned three

     17    publications, you mentioned the Brown publication 1941,

     18    the Fleischer Drinker report of 1946, the Marr study of

     19    1964.  There was also discussions of the Walsh-Healey

     20    Act.  So let's just focus on those four publications.

     21              If in fact Mr. Drummond was working either with

     22    or around asbestos insulation materials in the manner in

     23    which he described in association with Westinghouse or

     24    General Electric products or equipment, if he was doing

     25    that during the timeframe in question, would there --






                                                                   47




      1    would he have been advised or received information

      2    regarding respiratory protection as to asbestos if he was

      3    in danger from those exposures based on what was

      4    published?  I'm not saying it happened, based on what the

      5    Navy was telling the world.

      6         A.   Well, and I may need some help in understanding

      7    this.  Certainly, if there was a perceived risk, that

      8    without the respiratory protection there was risk of

      9    disease that would be reduced or eliminated with

     10    respiratory protection, then certainly that communication

     11    would have taken place.

     12              But from a state of an art perspective,

     13    especially from '56 to '71, if I'm understanding your

     14    question correctly, we have to put ourself back in that

     15    time period and without question mesothelioma was not

     16    considered a risk of bystanders in my opinion at that

     17    point.

     18              The risk was focused especially in the 60s as

     19    we've mentioned on insulators.  So insulators and when

     20    you read the Fleischer Drinker study it has to do with

     21    marine insulators, are encouraged to utilize a variety of

     22    measures including respiratory protection.

     23              Now from my reading of these deposition

     24    volumes, I saw no evidence that Mr. Drummond was an

     25    insulator.  So I think we've agreed that at best or at






                                                                   48




      1    the worst he was a bystander.  And, therefore, the advice

      2    at that time would not be that if you're a bystander, A,

      3    you're at risk of getting a disease, especially something

      4    like mesothelioma and, B, that you as a bystander would

      5    be asked to wear respirators.

      6              Certainly, if you're an insulator after the

      7    Selikoff studies in the mid to late 60s, then of course

      8    that would be wise.  And of course with OSHA that's

      9    addressed specifically.  So I don't -- does that answer

     10    your question?

     11         Q.   Yeah.  In fact, let me make it easier so we

     12    have a cleaner record following what you threw in.  It

     13    was really a bad question by me.

     14              If there was a perceived risk of danger to

     15    Mr. Drummond from exposure to asbestos from the

     16    activities that he described, if, and I understand your

     17    opinion is that there was not, but let's assume that

     18    there was, okay.

     19              Based upon what the Navy -- well, not only the

     20    Navy but even the shipyards, based upon what was in the

     21    published scientific and medical literature, would

     22    Mr. Drummond have been advised of those dangers and the

     23    need to use respiratory protection doing the activities

     24    that he described if there was a perceived risk?

     25         A.   Certainly, yes, if the risk was of adverse






                                                                   49




      1    outcomes, yes.

      2         Q.   Okay.  Would he again based upon what was in

      3    the public medical and scientific literature, would he

      4    have been advised or would he have been -- or would have

      5    there been utilized ventilation and exhaust for dust

      6    control purposes in the areas that he talked about in the

      7    manner in which he describes?

      8         A.   Yes.

      9         Q.   Okay.  Would the Navy in the shipyard have put

     10    in place as part of dust control measures moistening of

     11    the materials and, again, I'm referring to the Brown

     12    article?

     13         A.   Certainly the wet methods were an engineering

     14    device that was recommended by many.  So, again, if there

     15    was a perceived risk, that would have been wise.

     16         Q.   Okay.  In simple -- in simple language, if

     17    there was a perceived risk based upon what is described

     18    in the literature during the relevant timeframe we're

     19    about, would Mr. Drummond have been made aware of those

     20    risks and dangers?

     21         A.   Yes.

     22              MR. SPEZIALI:  Okay.  I don't have any other

     23         questions.  Thank you, Doctor.

     24              MS. MCMORRIS:  I have nothing further.

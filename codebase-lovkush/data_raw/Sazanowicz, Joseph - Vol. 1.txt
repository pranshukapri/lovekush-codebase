 5            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  On the record at
 6   10:03 a.m.  This is the deposition of Joseph
 7   Sazanowicz recorded on January 31, 2019 in
 8   Plantsville, Connecticut.
 9            This deposition is being taken in the
10   case of Joseph and Nancy Sazanowicz versus
11   Advance Auto Parts and was noticed by the
12   defendants.
13            The videotape operator is Chad Roy of
14   Geomatrix Productions, 270 Amity Road,
15   Woodbridge, Connecticut.
16            MS. VELLUCCI:  Good morning, sir.  My
17   name is Margreta Vellucci.  I'm going to ask
18   you some questions.  Can I just ask the court
19   reporter to administer the oath.
20                      * * * * *
21       JOSEPH SAZANOWICZ, Deponent, having first
22   been satisfactorily identified and duly sworn
23   by the Notary Public, deposes and states as
24   follows:
0011
 1                      * * * * *
 2                EXAMINATION CONDUCTED
 3   BY MS. VELLUCCI:
 4       Q.   Okay.  Sir, I'm going to put a few
 5   things on the record just with your attorney
 6   first.  All right?
 7       A.   Sure.
 8            MS. VELLUCCI:  Chris, will you agree
 9   to the usual stipulations?
10            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Yes.
11            MS. VELLUCCI:  And I'll put those on
12   the record just so we have them.  And that's
13   that an objection by one defendant is good for
14   all.
15            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Right.
16            MS. VELLUCCI:  That all objections,
17   except as to form, are reserved.
18            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Right.
19            MS. VELLUCCI:  And same with motions
20   to strike, they're reserved.
21            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Right.
22            MS. VELLUCCI:  And because we're kind
23   of doing this deposition shortly after the
24   complaint was filed, there are a number of
0012
 1   defendants that have not yet been served, so an
 2   appearance at this deposition, it's our
 3   position that it doesn't waive any defenses as
 4   to service of process.
 5            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  And the usual, I
 6   reserve my right to argue otherwise, if I have
 7   to, but that's fine.
 8            MS. VELLUCCI:  Okay.  And lastly, with
 9   respect to Judge Bellis's rule, that only
10   Connecticut licensed attorneys can be here.  If
11   you are not licensed in Connecticut, you just
12   let Chris or I know right away and otherwise we
13   will proceed.
14            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Right.
15       Q.   Sir, can you please state your full
16   name for me, please.
17       A.   Joseph A. Sazanowicz, Jr.
18       Q.   And what does the "A" stand for?
19       A.   Anthony.
20       Q.   And what's your date of birth?
21       A.   11/23/1954.
22       Q.   And are the last four digits of your
23   Social Security number 2690?
24       A.   Correct.
0013
 1       Q.   Can you tell me your address, please?
 2       A.   4 Florence Lane, Plantsville,
 3   Connecticut.
 4       Q.   And that's where we are today?
 5       A.   Correct.
 6       Q.   And how long have you lived here, sir?
 7       A.   35 --
 8            MS. SAZANOWICZ:  3.
 9       A.   33 years.
10       Q.   Okay.  And have you ever been deposed
11   before?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   And was that in connection with a
14   lawsuit or your job?
15       A.   In connection with a law enforcement
16   lawsuit.
17       Q.   Were you a party to the lawsuit, or
18   were you a witness?
19       A.   I was a party to the lawsuit.
20       Q.   And when was that?
21       A.   Oh, it was quite a while ago, 20 years
22   maybe.  20 years ago.
23       Q.   Okay.  I'm going to go through just a
24   couple of admonitions that your attorney may
0014
 1   have already gone through with you.  It's just
 2   important that you verbalize all of your
 3   responses.  We have a court reporter taking
 4   down everything I'm saying and you're saying.
 5            And if I do remind you, if you do nod
 6   or shake your head and I remind you, I don't
 7   mean it to be rude.  It's just so that we have
 8   a clear record.  Okay?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   All right.  And it's also important
11   that we don't speak over one another, so I'll
12   do my best to wait until you finish answering
13   before I ask a question, and I just ask that
14   you wait until I finish a question before you
15   answer.  Okay?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   If I've asked a question and you
18   answer it, I'm going to assume that you
19   understood it; is that fair?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   And I just ask that -- I'm going to be
22   asking you questions that go back aways to the
23   '60s and the '70s.  If at any point you don't
24   know the answer, feel free to just say I don't
0015
 1   know.  Okay?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   And I just ask that you don't guess,
 4   so if you can give an estimate, that's fine.
 5   Just don't guess.  Does that sound fair?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   You're married?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   And what is your wife's name?
10       A.   Nancy.
11       Q.   And what's her maiden name?
12       A.   Morin.
13       Q.   And what's her date of birth?
14       A.   June 1, 1956.
15       Q.   And when were the two of you married?
16       A.   October 29, 1977.
17       Q.   Do you have any other marriages, or is
18   that your only marriage?
19       A.   The only one.
20       Q.   And you have two children, right?
21       A.   Correct.
22       Q.   What are their names?
23       A.   Rachel and Robert.
24       Q.   Okay.  And Rachel, where does she
0016
 1   live?
 2       A.   Excuse me?
 3       Q.   Where does Rachel live?
 4       A.   Rachel lives in Brooklyn, New York.
 5       Q.   And where does your son live?
 6       A.   Cheshire, Connecticut.
 7       Q.   Okay.  Sir, are you taking any
 8   medications today that may affect your ability
 9   to testify or answer questions truthfully?
10       A.   I don't know.
11       Q.   So as you're sitting here today --
12       A.   I'm taking medications.  I don't know
13   if it's affecting me or not in testifying.
14       Q.   Could you just tell me what
15   medications you're taking either that you took
16   this morning or you took last night?
17       A.   Can my wife answer that question?
18       Q.   No, unfortunately.  But to the best of
19   your memory.  And if you don't know, that's
20   fine.
21            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Not the names, Joe,
22   but if you're on pain medication.
23       A.   I'm on a cough medicine.  It stifles
24   the cough, and I had some codeine yesterday.  I
0017
 1   had some cough medicine with codeine before I
 2   went to bed last night, but I really don't know
 3   how it affects me.
 4       Q.   Okay.  But you're doing your best to
 5   give truthful and accurate testimony?
 6       A.   Yeah.  I didn't take any painkiller
 7   this morning that I'm aware of that's a
 8   painkiller, but my meds obviously have
 9   something to do with coughing and all that.
10       Q.   And if at any point you need a break,
11   just let me know.
12       A.   Yeah, I got you.  No problem.
13       Q.   I just ask that if I ask a question,
14   that you answer it, and then we'll go right to
15   the break.  Okay?
16       A.   Okay.
17       Q.   Sir, are you currently employed?
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   And you retired, right?
20       A.   December 1, I retired.
21       Q.   Of what year?
22       A.   2018.
23       Q.   Can you tell me where did you go to
24   high school?
0018
 1       A.   Southington High School.
 2       Q.   Did you graduate?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   When did you graduate?

 9   Haven.
10       Q.   When was that?
11       A.   1984, a bachelor's degree.  Also, I
12   have an associate's degree from Thompson**
13   Community College, 1978.
14       Q.   And that was a two-year degree?
15       A.   Correct.
16       Q.   Did you go to get your associate's
17   part-time at night, or were you going during
18   the day?
19       A.   Part-time.
20       Q.   And what about your bachelor's degree?
21       A.   Part-time.
22       Q.   Okay.  Where did you grow up?  Where
23   were you born?
24       A.   Right here in Southington.
0019
 1       Q.   Do you remember the first address that
 2   you lived at?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   What was that?
 5       A.   17 Sunnyridge Drive.
 6       Q.   And that's in Southington?
 7       A.   Correct.
 8       Q.   And when did you live there until?
 9       A.   Until I was married in 1977.
10       Q.   Okay.  And so you moved out of the
11   home on Sunnyridge Drive in 1977, and then
12   where did you live?
13       A.   145 Liberty Street.
14       Q.   Also in Southington?
15       A.   Correct.
16       Q.   How long did you live there?
17       A.   Approximately, two years.
18       Q.   Okay.  And then in about 1979, where
19   did you live?
20       A.   I believe it was 22 John Street,
21   again, in Southington.
22       Q.   And how long did you live there?
23       A.   Until we bought this place in 1985.
24       Q.   Okay.  And you've lived at your home
0020
 1   where we're at today since 1985?
 2       A.   Yeah, it might have been longer at
 3   Liberty Street than I just mentioned.  Probably
 4   at least three years at Liberty Street and a
 5   few at John Street.
 6       Q.   Okay.  All right.  So the residences
 7   that you just listed for me, those are the only
 8   places where you've lived?
 9       A.   Correct.
10       Q.   Okay.  I want to go right into some
11   work that you did starting with the work you
12   did in high school.  Okay?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Can you tell me the first job that you
15   held?
16       A.   In high school or ever?
17       Q.   Ever.  You can tell me the first job
18   you ever did.
19       A.   I was a newspaper boy, obviously, like
20   everyone else, but I also worked on farms.  I
21   forgot to mention this before.  I worked on a
22   farm for two years from May until October or
23   November when I was -- I believe I was 13 and I
24   was 14 or -- I was either 13 and 14 or 14 and
0021
 1   15.  I'm not sure.
 2       Q.   So during those two years, either when
 3   you were 13 to 14 or 14 to 15, you worked at a
 4   farm from May to October or November?
 5       A.   Approximately to the end of, you know,
 6   when school let out.  Maybe the first year I
 7   didn't start until school let out in June, and
 8   I stayed until fall until harvest time.  And
 9   then the following year we started much earlier
10   and worked until it got cold.
11       Q.   And where were those farms located?
12       A.   The farm was located on Route 3 -- I
13   believe it's called Route 322.  It's in
14   Southington.  It was called The Corn Crib.
15   It's over by the movie theater on the south end
16   of town.  A movie theater sits on the property
17   now.  A truck stop sits on the property.
18       Q.   Did you work at the same farm both of
19   those years?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   What did you do there?
22       A.   First thing we ever did was pull
23   weeds.  We fertilized.  We threw insecticides
24   out.  We gathered crops.  We got to drive
0022
 1   tractors.  We did some plowing.  We supervised
 2   a bunch of older people.  We were 14, 15 years
 3   old supervising 30-year-old guys.
 4       Q.   What kind of farm was this?
 5       A.   Vegetable farm.
 6       Q.   And part of your job was fertilizing,
 7   you said?
 8       A.   That was one of the things we had
 9   done.
10       Q.   Did you work with any vermiculite?
11       A.   I don't know.
12       Q.   Okay.  Do you know -- are you able to
13   tell me the types of products that you used to
14   fertilize?
15       A.   Fertilizing could have been done by
16   hand where you just had a bucket of fertilizer
17   and threw a shot next to every tomato plant, or
18   it could have been -- I think fertilizer was --
19   the only fertilizing was done by hand, if I can
20   remember correctly.
21       Q.   Did you physically touch the
22   fertilizer with your hands?
23       A.   Oh, yes, all the time.
24       Q.   And I don't mean to interrupt you, but
0023
 1   I just want to remind you again, if you could
 2   just wait until I finish the question and then
 3   answer.  I know it's a little awkward, but it
 4   just makes for a cleaner record down the
 5   record.  Okay?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   So you said you actually worked with
 8   the fertilizer; you held it in your hand?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   And you would spread it out?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   And you don't know what the fertilizer
13   was made of?
14       A.   The fertilizer had numbers, you know.
15   It was a proportion of nitrates, potassium,
16   whatever.  It had a number like 5, 10, 15, or
17   something.
18       Q.   Did it come in bags or packaging?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Do you recall anything about what the
21   packaging looked like?
22       A.   Big sacks.  I believe they were --
23   well, I don't know.  They were 50 or 75 or 100
24   pounds.  I don't know.
0024
 1       Q.   Okay.  And is that something you did
 2   every day?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   How often did you fertilize?
 5       A.   I believe -- well, I'm not sure, but
 6   it was not every day.  It was maybe over a few
 7   weeks you had to -- every few weeks you gave it
 8   a little shot.  Depended on the weather, the
 9   rain.
10       Q.   How large was this farm?
11       A.   It was more than 30 acres, less than
12   40, I believe.
13       Q.   And you said -- you mentioned doing
14   some plowing, and I'm wondering did you do any
15   kind of mechanical work on any of the equipment
16   or vehicles that may have been on the farm?
17       A.   No.
18       Q.   Did anyone do any mechanical work in
19   your presence on any equipment or vehicles on
20   the farm?
21       A.   Well, the farmer did.
22       Q.   Okay.  Can you tell me -- do you have
23   a specific memory of what the farmer did?
24       A.   No.
0025
 1       Q.   Do you remember the type of equipment
 2   he was working on?
 3       A.   Tractors.
 4       Q.   Do you remember the brand of any of
 5   those tractors?
 6       A.   Farmall and International Harvester.
 7   National Harvester or International Harvester.
 8   I'm not sure of the name.
 9       Q.   Who owned this farm?
10       A.   Frank DeMaria.
11       Q.   Was he the mechanic, or was that
12   someone else?
13       A.   He was a one-man show.
14       Q.   And, as you sit here today, can you
15   tell me, specifically, what type of work he did
16   on those tractors in your presence?
17       A.   Well, no, no.
18       Q.   All right.  So we just talked about
19   the farm work kind of briefly.  Any other jobs
20   that you held for pay while you were in high
21   school?
22       A.   Yeah, I worked at the Mt. Southington
23   Ski Area.
24       Q.   And what did you do there?
0026
 1       A.   I operated lifts.  I got that job when
 2   I turned 16.
 3       Q.   Was that part-time?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Was that all year or just in ski
 6   season?
 7       A.   Ski season.
 8       Q.   And what was that?
 9       A.   Well, it would be November -- I
10   believe I started November of 1970, and then
11   when the ski area closed, we were done.
12       Q.   Okay.  And so that would be until the
13   end of the winter in '71?
14       A.   First year, yes.
15       Q.   Did you work there more than one year?
16       A.   Yes, two years.
17       Q.   So age 16 and 17?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   Was that on the weekends or weeknights
20   or both?
21       A.   Yes, weekends.  There might have been
22   occasional weeknights, but we couldn't work
23   past a certain time.
24       Q.   What time was that?
0027
 1       A.   I don't recall.
 2       Q.   And why couldn't you work past a
 3   certain time?
 4       A.   Because we weren't 18 years of age
 5   yet.
 6       Q.   All right.  Other than operate the ski
 7   lifts, is there anything else you did when you
 8   were working for the Mt. Southington Ski Area?
 9       A.   It was all related to lift operation.
10       Q.   Did you do any mechanical work on the
11   ski lifts?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Okay.  Did anyone do that in your
14   presence?
15       A.   No.
16       Q.   Any other jobs that you held in high
17   school?
18       A.   Gas station jobs.
19       Q.   All right.  What was the first gas
20   station that you worked at?
21       A.   First one was the Argo station on West
22   Street in Southington, and then again, it
23   was -- it would have been the same time I was
24   working in the ski area and all that.
0028
 1       Q.   So 1970 and 1971?
 2       A.   Yeah, 1970ish, and I worked at night
 3   there, a night or two a weekend.
 4       Q.   All right.  Let me ask you a couple
 5   questions about what you just said.  You said
 6   you worked a night or two?
 7       A.   Correct.
 8       Q.   During the week?
 9       A.   Correct.
10       Q.   After school?
11       A.   Correct.
12       Q.   And then did you also work there on
13   the weekend?
14       A.   I believe I did, yes.
15       Q.   Was that one day on the weekend or
16   both days?
17       A.   I don't -- I would guess it would be
18   one, but I don't know.  No, I don't know.  I
19   don't know.
20       Q.   Okay.  What were your hours when you
21   worked there during the week?
22       A.   I don't know exactly.
23       Q.   Would you go right after school?
24       A.   I might have.
0029
 1       Q.   Do you remember if you went home
 2   first?
 3       A.   I don't recall.
 4       Q.   Do you know how late the gas station
 5   was open until?
 6       A.   I think that one stayed open until
 7   10:00.
 8       Q.   Did you work until 10 p.m.?
 9       A.   Yes, I did.
10       Q.   So that same situation where you
11   couldn't work late at the ski area didn't apply
12   to the gas station?
13       A.   No, because this was family.  This was
14   my -- this was family.
15       Q.   How were you paid?  Were you paid by
16   check or cash?
17       A.   I don't recall.
18       Q.   And who owned the gas station?
19       A.   At that time Pasquale Bruschino.
20       Q.   Pasquale, and what was the last name?
21       A.   Bruschino, B-R-U-S-C-H-I-N-O.
22       Q.   And that was a family friend?
23       A.   He was my sister's boyfriend.
24       Q.   And what was your sister's name?
0030
 1       A.   Carolyn.  They eventually were married
 2   and divorced.
 3       Q.   Okay.  Did you work at the Argo gas
 4   station at the same time you were working at
 5   the ski area?
 6       A.   I believe so.
 7       Q.   So during a given week, you might work
 8   a night or two at the gas station and then a
 9   night or two at the ski area?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   Okay.  Did you ever work more than two
12   days a week at the gas station?
13       A.   I don't recall.
14       Q.   Can you describe it for me at all, in
15   other words, what the gas station looked like?
16       A.   It was a single-story building with --
17   I believe it had two garage bays, offices on
18   the right side, gas pumps were out front.
19       Q.   How many gas pumps were there?
20       A.   I believe there was a double island,
21   two islands, probably a couple on each -- I
22   don't know exactly on each island, but I
23   believe there was two islands.
24       Q.   Did the bays have lifts?
0031
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   And did they have the roll-up doors in
 3   front of the bays?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Do you know about how tall the
 6   ceilings were in there?
 7       A.   Oh, at least 13 feet.
 8       Q.   And what were you hired to do there?
 9       A.   Pump gas.
10       Q.   And was that your primary
11   responsibility?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Did you do anything other than pump
14   gas?
15       A.   Whatever was needed.
16       Q.   And what would that be?
17       A.   Well, if someone was doing a brake
18   job, you'd help them do the brake job.  If you
19   had to change a tire, you'd change a tire.
20   Most of the time I'm there by myself,
21   obviously, because I'm there at night.
22       Q.   Do you recall the names of any
23   mechanics who worked there?
24       A.   Pasquale Bruschino.
0032
 1       Q.   Was he --
 2       A.   He was the mechanic.  He was the
 3   owner.
 4       Q.   Was he the only mechanic?
 5       A.   I'm not sure.
 6       Q.   What time did mechanic work take place
 7   at the garage?  I know you said the gas pumps
 8   or the station was open until 10, but do you
 9   know around when they stopped doing mechanic
10   work on cars?
11       A.   No, I don't know.
12       Q.   And you said that you'd be alone
13   there?
14       A.   Mostly.
15       Q.   When you were working there, Pasquale,
16   he was home or at least he wasn't at the gas
17   station?
18       A.   He might have been there for a short
19   period of time and then went home.
20       Q.   Okay.  And you weren't a mechanic?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   Okay.  That's a true statement?
23       A.   By trade, no, I'm not a mechanic by
24   trade.
0033
 1       Q.   Okay.  And to the extent that you did
 2   any type of automotive work at this gas
 3   station, you were assisting; is that fair to
 4   say?
 5       A.   Correct.
 6       Q.   Okay.  And would you assist on
 7   anything that the mechanic needed your help
 8   with, or is there something in particular that
 9   you did?
10       A.   Anything he needed help with.
11       Q.   Okay.  And was this a full-service gas
12   station and garage?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Was there anything that came in the
15   door that he would turn away as far as
16   automotive repair?
17       A.   I don't know.
18       Q.   Okay.  And you said you'd help with
19   brake work and you mentioned tire changing.  Is
20   there anything else that you recall assisting
21   with at this gas station?
22       A.   We worked on engines.  We rebuilt
23   motors.
24       Q.   Would you do oil changes?
0034
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   What about things like replacing
 3   filters?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Did you replace headlights and
 6   batteries and things like that?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Did you replace spark plugs?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   Did you do any radiator work?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   What about inspections, did this gas
13   station offer inspections?
14       A.   I don't know.  I don't recall.
15       Q.   In your shift -- -- strike that.
16            When I asked you before the hours you
17   kept, I know that was kind of a difficult thing
18   to remember.  Do you know how many hours you
19   would work in a given shift?
20       A.   I know I worked a lot of hours.
21       Q.   Okay.  Do you know how much you were
22   paid hourly?
23       A.   I believe it was minimum wage, $1.65.
24       Q.   And were you paid every week?
0035
 1       A.   Yes.  I do recall between my various
 2   jobs, I worked 70 hours a week at times.  I'm
 3   sorry.  When school was out, I worked 70 hours
 4   a week.
 5       Q.   During the school year, if we're
 6   thinking about a given week during the school
 7   year, do you know about how many hours you
 8   would have worked at this gas station?
 9       A.   It would just be a guess.
10       Q.   And I don't want you to guess.
11       A.   Yeah, I don't know.
12       Q.   But would it have been from the time
13   you got out of school or thereabouts until the
14   time the garage closed, which you said was
15   around 10 p.m.?
16       A.   Yeah, whenever I got there until 10
17   p.m.
18       Q.   Okay.  That's helpful.
19       A.   Of course, weekends would be
20   different, of course.
21       Q.   What time was the garage open on the
22   weekends?
23       A.   In the morning.
24       Q.   Was that Saturday and Sunday or just
0036
 1   Saturday, if you remember?
 2       A.   I don't recall.
 3       Q.   Okay.
 4                 (Off the record, 10:26 a.m.)
 5                 (Back on the record, 10:26 a.m.)
 6       Q.   Did you participate in any
 7   after-school activities when you were in high
 8   school?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   So no sports or clubs or anything like
11   that?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Were you a good student?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   Did you do homework?
16       A.   Rarely.
17       Q.   Okay.  So if you were to do homework,
18   when would you do that?
19       A.   In school.
20       Q.   So you wouldn't do that at home after
21   school or on the weekends?
22       A.   Probably not.
23       Q.   Okay.  How did you get to this gas
24   station?  Were you old enough to drive at that
0037
 1   point, the Argo gas station?
 2       A.   I would have gotten rides.  I was old
 3   enough to drive, but I didn't have a car.
 4       Q.   How old were you when you first got a
 5   car?
 6       A.   Close to 17.
 7       Q.   And who would give you rides, your
 8   parents or friends?
 9       A.   Sister.
10       Q.   And she was older than you?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   This garage, did it do work on
13   passenger vehicles?  And by that I mean cars,
14   light trucks?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   No heavy equipment or heavy-duty
17   trucks?
18       A.   No.
19       Q.   Was the work done on domestic
20   vehicles, foreign vehicles, or both?
21       A.   I can recall domestic vehicles.
22       Q.   Okay.  And do you recall specifically
23   any makes of vehicles that you either did work
24   on or you assisted in doing work on?
0038
 1       A.   All makes, American cars.
 2       Q.   Okay.  So Chevys?
 3       A.   Chevys, Fords, Dodge, Chrysler,
 4   Plymouth.
 5       Q.   All right.  Were you ever -- was it
 6   ever the case that during your shift you would
 7   participate in a brake job from start to
 8   finish, or were you there kind of pitching in
 9   and helping at whatever stage it was in when
10   you arrived?
11       A.   Mr. Bruschino taught me how to do
12   them, so I would go through -- several times I
13   recall going through right there with him step
14   by step and him instructing me how to do them.
15       Q.   Do you recall how many times that you
16   were alongside him assisting or being
17   instructed on how to do a brake job?
18       A.   Many.  I don't recall.  I mean, more
19   than five.
20       Q.   Okay.  Was it more than five, less
21   than ten?
22       A.   Maybe more than ten.
23       Q.   Okay.  Was it less than 15?
24       A.   Maybe less than 15.
0039
 1       Q.   Okay.  And you never did a brake job
 2   on your own there; is that true?
 3       A.   Yeah, I did.
 4       Q.   You did?
 5       A.   I learned how to do them.
 6       Q.   How many brake jobs do you recall
 7   doing on your own?
 8       A.   Most of them would be on, like, my own
 9   stuff, my own car, you know, my mother's car,
10   my sister's car.
11       Q.   Did you ever do brake work on
12   customers' cars at this gas station?
13       A.   Complete by myself, no.
14       Q.   Okay.  When you were assisting and
15   learning how to do a brake job, what was your
16   role?  In other words, were you actively doing
17   anything, or were you kind of passively
18   watching and maybe handing tools?
19       A.   Well, he would instruct me, and I did
20   what he told me to do.
21       Q.   So you had some hands-on?
22       A.   Yeah, all hands-on.
23       Q.   Were these drum brake jobs, disc brake
24   jobs, or both while you were at that gas
0040
 1   station?
 2       A.   I wasn't very good at the discs.  Disc
 3   was new, so it was mostly drums.  Discs was a
 4   brand-new thing.
 5       Q.   When you were assisting with brake
 6   jobs, were you doing all four wheels or just
 7   two?
 8       A.   Back then you had rear drums and front
 9   discs, so mostly the drums.
10       Q.   Okay.  So two in the rear of the
11   vehicle?
12       A.   Yeah.
13       Q.   Okay.  If I asked you to describe how
14   you went about doing a drum brake job or how
15   you assisted, could you describe the steps for
16   me?
17       A.   Now?
18       Q.   Yes.
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   Could you tell me anything that you
21   remember doing when you were doing a drum brake
22   job?
23       A.   Yeah.  I mean, you had to take these
24   retainers off, these springs.  You had
0041
 1   different tools that you'd put on the retainer.
 2   You turn your tool.  And whatever it was called
 3   that held the part on came off.  You pulled the
 4   drums off.  You loosened the cable up from the
 5   emergency brake, and then we used to spray it
 6   with an air hose.
 7       Q.   Was there an air hose at this gas
 8   station?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   And did you actually use the air hose
11   when you were doing this?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   And how long would you use the air
14   hose for per wheel, if you can tell me?
15       A.   Probably a matter of seconds to clear
16   the dust away.
17       Q.   So after everything was removed, what
18   did you do next?
19       A.   Well, everything was removed and you
20   put the new parts on.
21       Q.   Okay.  And did you just kind of follow
22   the reverse of the order in which you took the
23   parts off?
24       A.   Yeah.  Well, I used to leave one -- do
0042
 1   one side at a time, so I can go back and look
 2   at the other side to make sure I knew what I
 3   was doing.
 4       Q.   Okay.  Do you know approximately how
 5   long it would take to do a two-wheel drum brake
 6   job while you were at this gas station?
 7       A.   No, I don't know.  It depends on how
 8   fast you wanted to work.
 9       Q.   Do you know how long, when you were
10   learning and kind of doing this hands-on work
11   with the owner, how long that would take?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Was it an hour?  Was it a half hour?
14       A.   I mean, you don't want me to guess.
15       Q.   I don't.
16       A.   I don't know.  It wasn't two hours.
17       Q.   Okay.  The new parts that you were
18   installing, the new brakes, were those ready to
19   fit the vehicle in which they were being
20   installed?
21       A.   Yeah, you ordered them to fit the
22   vehicle.
23       Q.   Okay.  And so when they were ordered,
24   they were ordered for that particular make,
0043
 1   model, year of car, right?
 2       A.   Right.
 3       Q.   And did they fit?
 4       A.   If they didn't, you got the right
 5   ones.  You had to change them.
 6       Q.   So if they didn't fit, you'd exchange
 7   them for a new set of brakes?
 8       A.   Correct.
 9       Q.   Did you have to do anything to the new
10   brake in order to install it?
11       A.   Not that I recall.
12       Q.   Okay.  For any of the vehicles that
13   you worked on or assisted working on at this
14   gas station, would you know the car's prior
15   maintenance history or repair history before
16   you worked on it?
17       A.   Probably not.
18       Q.   Would you know the brand of any brake
19   that you removed or that the owner removed in
20   your presence from a vehicle at this gas
21   station?
22       A.   I recall brands that we used to use.
23       Q.   That you installed?
24       A.   Yeah.
0044
 1       Q.   Do you know the brands of any of the
 2   brakes that were removed?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   Okay.  And you said you would know the
 5   brands or at least some of the brands that were
 6   installed, right?
 7       A.   Yeah.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Who ordered replacement parts?
 9       A.   Could have been me.
10       Q.   Do you remember ordering replacement
11   parts there?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Okay.  Did you ever have to go pick up
14   replacement parts?
15       A.   I don't recall.
16       Q.   You said you didn't have your license
17   then, so you probably didn't.
18       A.   I did.  I didn't have a car.
19       Q.   Okay.  Do you remember going to pick
20   up parts while you were at this gas station,
21   going to any particular store?
22       A.   Yeah, I mean -- I can't be specific
23   about where I was working or doing at the time
24   that I went to any particular parts store.
0045
 1       Q.   Just so I understand what you're
 2   saying.  Is it that you remember getting parts
 3   from certain stores?
 4       A.   Sure.
 5       Q.   But you just don't know which stores
 6   you went to for this job?
 7       A.   Correct.
 8       Q.   Can you tell me, in general, which
 9   stores you recalled going to -- and I'm not
10   asking yet about work on your own vehicles.  I
11   mean work done at this gas station or any other
12   gas station, and we'll talk more about the
13   others in a bit.
14       A.   Some of the stores we used was NAPA in
15   Plantsville.  We used Southington Auto Parts.
16   We used Newington Auto Parts.  I believe we
17   also -- I'm trying to think if we used Western
18   Auto or not.  I don't recall Western Auto right
19   now, but we used whatever there was.  We'd call
20   around, get a price, and some places delivered.
21   Others we had to pick up.
22       Q.   Okay.  Let me ask you a couple
23   questions then about those stores that you
24   listed.  And just to be clear, these are the
0046
 1   three stores, NAPA in Plantsville, Southington
 2   Auto Parts, and Newington Auto Parts are parts
 3   stores that you recalled getting auto parts
 4   from at the various different gas stations
 5   where you worked, and we're only talking about
 6   one right now?
 7       A.   Also Weiner's in New Britain.
 8       Q.   Okay.  So that's four?
 9       A.   They did the engine work.
10       Q.   Did you get parts from Weiner's as
11   well?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   You said NAPA was in Plantsville?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Can you tell me where that store was
16   located?
17       A.   I believe it's called Main Street
18   where it is -- where it was or is.
19       Q.   And do you recall the full name of
20   that store, or did you just know it as NAPA?
21       A.   NAPA Auto Parts or Plantsville Auto
22   Parts.  If I'm not mistaken, it's Plantsville
23   Auto Parts and NAPA would have been the
24   franchise on it, but I could be wrong.  I think
0047
 1   that's how they do that.
 2       Q.   Do you recall seeing a sign either on
 3   the building or in the window or something like
 4   that in the store?
 5       A.   I've got a 50-year-old memory.
 6       Q.   Do you have a memory of what the sign
 7   looked like?
 8       A.   I could see "NAPA."  I could see
 9   N-A-P-A.
10       Q.   And you obviously saw "Plantsville
11   Auto Parts" somewhere on the building?
12       A.   I believe so.  I'm not sure on that,
13   but I knew it as that.  I knew it as
14   Plantsville Auto Parts, and I knew it as a NAPA
15   store.
16       Q.   Was that store affiliated with NAPA at
17   least during the time that you were going there
18   for parts or using parts from that store?
19       A.   Was it affiliated with NAPA?
20       Q.   For the entire time that you went
21   there?
22       A.   I don't know.
23       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall the name of the
24   owner of that store, by any chance?
0048
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   What about any employees?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   Do you know whether this gas station,
 5   Argo, had an account there?
 6       A.   I don't know.
 7       Q.   Do you know if they delivered parts or
 8   if the parts were picked up?
 9       A.   I don't recall.
10       Q.   Okay.  You also mentioned Southington
11   Auto Parts.  Where was that store located?
12       A.   That was on Route 10.
13       Q.   And do you know the owner or employees
14   at that store?
15       A.   No.
16       Q.   Do you know if this gas station, the
17   Argo gas station, had an account there?
18       A.   No.  I don't know.
19       Q.   And do you know whether they delivered
20   or whether parts were picked up?
21       A.   I don't know.
22       Q.   I'm going to ask you the same
23   questions about Newington Auto Parts.  Where
24   was that located?
0049
 1       A.   In Newington, Cedar Street.  That, we
 2   picked up.
 3       Q.   And do you recall the name of the
 4   owner or any employees at that store?
 5       A.   I remember a kid named Jeff.  I
 6   believe it was Jeff.  I don't know.
 7       Q.   That's okay.
 8       A.   I'm just throwing it out there to see
 9   if it sticks, I guess.
10       Q.   And what about Weiner's, you said that
11   was in New Britain?
12       A.   Yeah.
13       Q.   Where in New Britain?
14       A.   Where in New Britain?
15       Q.   Yes.
16       A.   I'm not sure the name of the street.
17       Q.   And you said that you had some engine
18   work done there.  Would you send engines there
19   to be rebuilt?
20       A.   Partial engines, blocks, heads.  That
21   was more of an industrial -- more of a
22   commercial operation, I should say, where you
23   could bring an engine and they'll rebuild it
24   for you or buy a short block or buy -- so if
0050
 1   you had bad valves on a motor, you took the
 2   heads off, you sent them.  They redid the head,
 3   charged you whatever, and you slapped it back
 4   on the engine.
 5       Q.   Do you recall whether the gas station
 6   ever purchased anything else from that store;
 7   in other words, other than --
 8       A.   Well, you've got your gaskets and
 9   everything else that went with whatever
10   operation you were doing.
11       Q.   Did the gaskets come in kits?  Were
12   they loose?
13       A.   Both.
14       Q.   Were they all precut?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Do you recall the brand of any gaskets
17   that were purchased from Weiner's in New
18   Britain?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   All right.  I want to go back to --
21   before I asked you about where you recalled the
22   gas station getting parts, we were talking
23   about brake work at Argo, and I wanted to ask
24   you if you recall the brands of any brakes that
0051
 1   you installed or were installed in your
 2   presence at Argo?
 3       A.   Yes.  Now, I can't remember right now.
 4       Q.   Okay.
 5       A.   I'm trying to remember.  Give me a
 6   second.
 7       Q.   Sure.
 8       A.   Because we used them all the time.  It
 9   was -- wow.  Chemo brain.
10       Q.   Let me ask you some questions that
11   might help refresh your memory.
12       A.   Well --
13       Q.   Go ahead.
14       A.   I can't remember.
15       Q.   Do you recall using any Raybestos
16   brakes?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   Okay.  Was that a brand of brake that
19   you --
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   -- worked with at that gas station?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And that's a brand of brake that you
24   installed on vehicles?
0052
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   Do you know if you ever removed them
 3   from vehicles?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Would you --
 6       A.   Well, I took brakes off vehicles and
 7   put those brakes on vehicles.
 8       Q.   So is it your memory that you would
 9   remove brakes you had previously installed; is
10   that your testimony?
11       A.   No.
12       Q.   Okay.  Then I think earlier you had
13   said that you might not remember the brakes
14   that you removed from vehicles; is that your
15   testimony?
16       A.   Right.
17       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall the word
18   "Raybestos" appearing on the packaging the
19   brakes came in?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   And --
22       A.   There was one other name also.  I
23   can't recall right now.
24       Q.   Another name on the box or another
0053
 1   brand?
 2       A.   Another brand.
 3       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall ever installing
 4   General Motors-branded brakes?
 5       A.   Yes, GM parts we used to buy, too.
 6       Q.   And would you get those parts from a
 7   dealership?
 8       A.   Not necessarily.  GM Delco.
 9       Q.   Where did you get the GM brakes?
10       A.   I don't recall, but not necessarily
11   from a dealer.  I don't know.  I don't recall
12   if you had to get them from a dealer or not.
13       Q.   Okay.  And would General Motors appear
14   on the packaging that the brakes came in?
15       A.   I believe it says "GM Delco."  I think
16   GM Delco was the line.
17       Q.   Okay.  What about Wagner brakes, is
18   that a brand that you recall installing?
19       A.   Yes, I recall Wagner.
20       Q.   And you installed those brakes while
21   you were at this gas station?
22       A.   I might have.  I recall Wagner brakes.
23       Q.   Okay.  And would you see the name
24   "Wagner" on the packaging that the brakes came
0054
 1   in?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   What about Mopar, do you recall
 4   installing any Mopar brakes?
 5       A.   I recall Mopar parts but not
 6   specifically brakes.
 7       Q.   Okay.  What about Johns-Manville
 8   brakes, do you recall installing any
 9   Johns-Manville brakes?
10       A.   No.
11       Q.   Do you recall installing any H.K.
12   Porter brakes?
13       A.   No.
14       Q.   Do you recall installing any Raytech
15   brakes?
16       A.   I recall the brand.  I don't recall if
17   I ever installed them though.
18       Q.   Okay.  Are there any other brands of
19   brakes that you can recall sitting here right
20   now installing while you were at this Argo gas
21   station?
22       A.   No.
23       Q.   And if something else comes to mind,
24   just let me know.  Okay?
0055
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   Do you know which brands of brakes you
 3   got from which store?  Is that possible for you
 4   to do?
 5       A.   No, I don't.
 6       Q.   Okay.  The brands that you did work
 7   with, and I can list them again that you
 8   recalled were Raybestos, the GM Delco, and
 9   Wagner, do you think you used those brakes
10   about equally, or is there one brand you think
11   you used more than the other at this gas
12   station?
13       A.   I don't recall.
14       Q.   Okay.  The brakes that you installed,
15   the linings, were they already attached to the
16   shoe?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   And do you know if they were bonded or
19   riveted, or did you see them come both ways?
20       A.   I remember both bonded and riveted.
21       Q.   Going quickly back to the NAPA store
22   that you mentioned earlier, do you have a
23   memory of purchasing replacement brakes or
24   working with replacement brakes that came from
0056
 1   that NAPA store at this gas station?
 2       A.   A specific memory, no.
 3       Q.   Okay.  Let me just look at something
 4   very quickly.  All right.  You mentioned doing
 5   some engine work, I believe --
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   -- at Argo; is that right?
 8       A.   Miss, I worked at different gas
 9   stations.
10       Q.   I know.
11       A.   This Argo station was not a long
12   period of time.
13       Q.   Do you know how long you worked there
14   for, how many months?
15       A.   It went out of business, so I was
16   probably only there for less than six months,
17   then I went on to other gas stations on the
18   same street.
19       Q.   Yes.
20       A.   So you're -- you know, you're tied
21   into this one thing here.  It's very difficult
22   for me to say if it's even the same place, the
23   way you're asking the questions, you know.
24       Q.   So it seems like it's easier for you
0057
 1   to talk generally about the work you did at the
 2   various gas stations, and it's harder to kind
 3   of separate them out; is that what you're
 4   saying?
 5       A.   Of course.  You're talking 50 years
 6   ago.
 7       Q.   Let me ask you just a couple more
 8   questions about this gas station and we'll move
 9   on to the other ones.  Okay?
10       A.   Sure.
11       Q.   And it may be that it will be a lot
12   faster since I've already asked you a lot of
13   questions on this one.  Okay?
14       A.   Sure.
15       Q.   And I'll go back to the question right
16   before we had that exchange.  Do you remember
17   at this gas station, Argo, doing engine work,
18   or you just don't know?
19       A.   We did engine work there.  We had a
20   motor we rebuilt.
21       Q.   Is there one motor that you have in
22   mind that you rebuilt at this gas station?
23       A.   Yeah, it was a 427 Chevy that we
24   rebuilt because we were going to stick it in my
0058
 1   Impala, vroom, vroom.
 2       Q.   Did you do that work yourself, or were
 3   you kind of learning?
 4       A.   With Patsy.
 5       Q.   Let me just ask you a couple quick
 6   questions about that engine rebuild.  Do you
 7   recall working with gaskets when you did that
 8   work?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   Do you recall removing gaskets?
11       A.   Yes.
12       Q.   Do you know the brand of gaskets you
13   removed?
14       A.   Jeez --
15       Q.   Was there any way to tell the brand
16   that you were removing?
17       A.   Well, when you're taking off a motor
18   probably, maybe sometimes they were stamped in
19   there with the name of the company, but I
20   should know this, but I don't.
21       Q.   Did you install new gaskets?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Were they precut?
24       A.   Normally, I would think.  That's how
0059
 1   gaskets came.  You got kits.
 2       Q.   Do you recall the brand of the kit or
 3   the brand of the gaskets?
 4       A.   No.  When you bought a -- if you were
 5   doing the top half of a motor, you got a top
 6   half of the motor gasket kit, and it had
 7   various gaskets for whatever you needed, you
 8   know, a head gasket, thermostat gasket, you
 9   know, water pipe gasket -- I mean, water pump
10   gasket, whatever you needed came in the
11   package.  You ripped it open, threw the stuff
12   together.
13       Q.   And that's generally how -- that was
14   your experience, generally?
15       A.   Yeah, you did it with care.
16       Q.   So let's talk about the next gas
17   station that you worked at.  You said that you
18   were at this one for less than six months and
19   then it closed down or went out of business,
20   right?
21       A.   Yeah.
22       Q.   And then where did you go?
23       A.   Right up the street to his uncle's gas
24   station.
0060
 1       Q.   Was that the Amoco station?
 2       A.   Correct.
 3       Q.   And that was also on West Street in
 4   Southington?
 5       A.   Correct.
 6       Q.   How long did you work there?
 7       A.   I'm guessing a couple years.  You got
 8   my tax return; you'll be able to tell.
 9       Q.   Okay.  So you were paid by check?
10       A.   Either check or cash.
11       Q.   Do you recall --
12       A.   I was on the books, I mean, you know.
13       Q.   Were you making minimum wage there as
14   well?
15       A.   Don't recall.
16       Q.   And you said it was his uncle.  That's
17   Patsy's uncle?
18       A.   Yeah.
19       Q.   What's his name?
20       A.   His name was Pasquale Pagano.
21       Q.   And he's deceased?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   And the owner of the Argo gas station,
24   is he still alive?
0061
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   And is he in the Southington area?
 3       A.   Yes, Berlin.
 4       Q.   In Berlin?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   Okay.
 7       A.   He's still my good friend.
 8       Q.   When is the last time you spoke to
 9   him?
10       A.   Either yesterday or the day before.
11       Q.   Does he know that you have a lawsuit
12   pending?
13       A.   No.  I don't know what he knows.
14       Q.   Does he know that you're giving
15   deposition testimony today?
16       A.   No.
17       Q.   Did you talk to him at all about the
18   gas station and the work that you did there?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   And you said he used to be married to
21   your sister, and then they divorced?
22       A.   Correct.
23       Q.   Okay.  Going back now to this Amoco
24   station, I'm just trying to figure out -- you
0062
 1   said you worked there a couple of years.  Was
 2   that starting in '71 then when you left the
 3   other gas station?  Does that sound like a fair
 4   estimate?
 5       A.   Yeah, yes.
 6       Q.   And how many either days a week did
 7   you work there or how many --
 8                 (Interruption.)
 9       Q.   How many hours a week or days a week
10   did you work at this gas station?
11       A.   One or two days a week.
12       Q.   And was this after school?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   And you were part-time --
15       A.   And weekends.  I worked the weekend.
16       Q.   Was it just Saturday or both days?
17       A.   It was either-or, or it could have
18   been both.  Could have been both or not.
19       Q.   Just depended on what work was
20   available?
21       A.   Yeah, they were open Sunday.  That
22   place was open Sundays.
23       Q.   And this was a gas station, right?
24       A.   Right.
0063
 1       Q.   Was your primary job there pumping gas
 2   as well?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   Were there any other gas pump
 5   attendants who worked the same shift as you?
 6       A.   No.
 7       Q.   What about at the prior gas station,
 8   any other gas pump attendants?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   Was Pasquale, the owner of the Amoco
11   station, was he a mechanic?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Were there any other mechanics there?
14       A.   At times.
15       Q.   Do you recall any of their names?
16       A.   No.
17       Q.   Were they part-time --
18       A.   Yes.  His nephew Pasquale, the guy
19   that had the other gas station, worked there as
20   a mechanic.  He was the head mechanic.
21       Q.   Was he there full-time?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   So when his garage closed down, he
24   went to work for his uncle?
0064
 1       A.   Correct.
 2       Q.   Okay.  Can you describe that station,
 3   how it looked?
 4       A.   Single floor, three-bay garage, office
 5   on the right side on the corner of the 84
 6   off-ramp and West Street.
 7       Q.   Is it still there today?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   It's still a gas station of some form
10   today?
11       A.   Yes, I believe it's a gas station
12   still.
13       Q.   Okay.  The three bays, did they have
14   lifts?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   And can you tell me the height of the
17   ceilings at that garage?
18       A.   Minimum, a dozen feet.
19       Q.   How many gas pumps were there?
20       A.   Two islands.
21       Q.   Other than pumping gas, did you have
22   any other job duties or responsibilities at
23   this gas station?
24       A.   Whatever needed to be done, you know.
0065
 1       Q.   And when you were doing whatever
 2   needed to be done, were you assisting others,
 3   or were you doing work on your own?
 4       A.   I could be changing a tire by myself.
 5       Q.   Okay.  Is there any other types of
 6   jobs that you did that you would have done by
 7   yourself there other than --
 8       A.   Change oil, change a wiper, change a
 9   headlight, minor mechanical stuff.
10       Q.   Go ahead.  I didn't know if you were
11   finished.
12       A.   (Nodding.)
13       Q.   Did you do any mechanical work which
14   was assisting either of the mechanics there?
15       A.   I don't recall.
16       Q.   Did you assist in any brake work
17   there?
18       A.   Specifically, I don't recall.
19       Q.   Okay.  So at this gas station, you
20   were primarily pumping gas and then doing those
21   minor mechanical jobs you just identified for
22   me?
23       A.   I don't recall.
24       Q.   Okay.  And was this another
0066
 1   full-service garage --
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   Did they turn any work away?
 4       A.   Did they turn any work away?
 5       Q.   Was there something they couldn't do
 6   that they had to send to another place?
 7       A.   These places wouldn't do much, you
 8   know, heavy, heavy-duty work, general repairs,
 9   you know.
10       Q.   All right.  Did you work at any other
11   gas stations?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   And what's that?
14       A.   Another one up the street after I quit
15   Mr. Pagano.
16       Q.   When did you quit?
17       A.   I don't recall.
18       Q.   Why did you quit?
19       A.   Because he was a thief.
20       Q.   Okay.  Did something happen?
21       A.   Yeah.
22       Q.   And what was that?
23       A.   Me and my brother-in-law went to get
24   our W-2 forms, and I knew how much money I
0067
 1   made, like 1,700 dollars or something over the
 2   year, and my W-2 form said I made like 700
 3   dollars.
 4       Q.   And when you saw that, you decided you
 5   were going to stop working there?
 6       A.   Yeah.
 7       Q.   Okay.
 8       A.   I had a few words.
 9       Q.   Okay.  So the next gas station that
10   you worked at, you said, was also down the
11   street.  What was that?  What was the name of
12   it?
13       A.   It was a Mobil station owned by Joe
14   Palmeri.
15       Q.   Can you say that last name one more
16   time?
17       A.   Joe Palmeri, P-A-L-M-E-R-I.
18       Q.   And was that employment part-time
19   while you were in school?
20       A.   I believe I was out of school.  I used
21   to work Friday nights.
22       Q.   Did you just work Friday nights?  Was
23   that your one shift?
24       A.   I recall working Friday nights.
0068
 1       Q.   Do you recall working any other
 2   evenings, nights?
 3       A.   No, I don't recall.
 4       Q.   Do you recall working there on the
 5   weekend at all?
 6       A.   I don't recall.
 7       Q.   Okay.  And about how long did you work
 8   at this gas station?
 9       A.   I'm going to say a year or so and I'm
10   thinking this is, like, later on, like, 1973 or
11   so where I was working full-time jobs and out
12   of high school and this was just one piece that
13   I had.
14       Q.   Do you recall where you were working
15   full-time while you were working the Friday
16   night shift at this gas station?
17       A.   I believe I was working at Precision
18   Grinding.
19       Q.   Okay.  Was it -- strike that.
20            Did I ask you the name of this gas
21   station?  I'm sorry if I did.
22       A.   You asked me.
23       Q.   Did you tell me?
24            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  It was Mobil.
0069
 1       A.   Joe, Joe Palmeri.  It was a Mobil
 2   station.
 3       Q.   Sorry about that, all right.
 4            Was it your job at the Mobil station
 5   to pump gas?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   Did you do anything else?
 8       A.   Yes.
 9       Q.   What did you do?
10       A.   Whatever was needed.
11       Q.   And would that be the minor types of
12   mechanical work that you mentioned before?
13       A.   Yes.
14       Q.   Like oil changes?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   And changing headlights?
17       A.   Yes, but mostly it was pumping gas
18   because it was a Friday night.
19       Q.   Were there any other employees working
20   there when you were working your Friday night
21   shift?
22       A.   No.
23       Q.   Were there any mechanics working while
24   you were working your Friday night shift?
0070
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   Can you think of any other types of --
 3   any work at all that you did other than what
 4   you've already listed for me at this gas
 5   station, or have I exhausted your memory as far
 6   as what jobs and responsibilities you had?
 7       A.   I can't recall.
 8       Q.   Okay.  For any of the brakes that
 9   you've worked with, do you recall or do you
10   know the composition of those brakes, what they
11   were made of?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Okay.  Did you ever install a metallic
14   brake?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Okay.  And where was that?
17       A.   Don't recall.
18       Q.   Do you know the brand of the metallic
19   brake?
20       A.   No.
21       Q.   Did you ever install any semimetallic
22   brakes?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And same questions, do you know where
0071
 1   that was?
 2       A.   No.
 3       Q.   Or what brand?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Did you ever install any ceramic
 6   brakes?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   And do you know where you did that?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   Or what brands?
11       A.   No.  I know those were the three
12   different types of stuff we used to see.
13       Q.   And that's at the garage at the gas
14   station?
15       A.   Yes.
16       Q.   Did you ever wear when you were doing
17   work at the gas stations a mask or respirator?
18       A.   When we found out that asbestos is not
19   good for you.
20       Q.   When was that?
21       A.   Too late, obviously, for me.
22       Q.   Do you remember when, where you were
23   working or what decade it was?
24       A.   I recall we were doing a brake job at
0072
 1   one of these places, and either I or someone
 2   else started spraying, and then somebody
 3   started yelling don't do that, blah, blah,
 4   blah, it's bad for you.
 5       Q.   What were you spraying, an air hose?
 6       A.   Air hose.
 7       Q.   Do you recall which of the -- is it
 8   one of the gas stations we've talked about?
 9       A.   Had to have been.
10       Q.   Because those are the only three gas
11   stations you worked at?
12       A.   Yeah.
13       Q.   Did you ever work at a gas station
14   after the Mobil station?
15       A.   No.
16       Q.   And you said you worked at the Mobil
17   station starting in '73.  Do you recall how
18   long you worked there for?
19       A.   No, I don't.  It had to be less than a
20   year, and then I started going to school again
21   after working too many jobs.
22       Q.   Would it be then that it was
23   sometime -- if you worked at that Mobil station
24   in '73 for less than a year, so it takes us to
0073
 1   about '74.  Would it be that this incident that
 2   you just described for me where someone told
 3   you it was bad to spray the air hose happened
 4   in either '74 or before '74?
 5       A.   I'm guessing it would be prior to '74.
 6       Q.   It had to be, right?
 7       A.   Correct.
 8       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall who it was that
 9   said that?
10       A.   No.
11       Q.   Was it a mechanic?
12       A.   Could have been Pasquale.  I don't
13   know.
14       Q.   And did you stop?  I mean, did you
15   listen to what he said?
16       A.   Yeah, you know.  We became aware that
17   asbestos was not good for you.  Prior to that
18   we would just spray away.  That's how you
19   cleaned the brakes off, you sprayed away.
20       Q.   Do you believe that you worked with
21   brakes that contained asbestos?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   And how is it that you believe that
24   some of the brakes you worked with contained
0074
 1   asbestos?
 2       A.   News media, you know.  News reports.
 3       Q.   And that was back in the '70s?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Did you ever see -- kind of thinking
 6   back at the packaging and the boxes the brakes
 7   came in, did you ever see the word "asbestos"
 8   or any indication that the brakes contained
 9   asbestos on the boxes?
10       A.   I don't recall.
11       Q.   Do you have any photos, documents, or
12   anything like that from your employment at
13   either of those three gas stations?
14       A.   I don't believe so.
15       Q.   Do you know if anyone would?  In other
16   words, would Pasquale, do you know if he would
17   have documents or photographs from either his
18   gas station or his uncle's?
19       A.   He may.  I don't know.
20       Q.   All right.  I want to ask you about
21   some personal automotive work.
22            MS. VELLUCCI:  Do you want to take a
23   break, or do you want to just keep going?
24            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Do you want to take
0075
 1   a short break, or are you okay?
 2            THE WITNESS:  I'm good.
 3       Q.   I'm going to ask you then about
 4   personal automotive work because you kind of
 5   alluded to it at the gas stations and you
 6   talked about doing some work on your vehicles.
 7            What I'd like to get an understanding
 8   of is the types of work that you've done on
 9   your vehicles or vehicles that other people
10   owned, friends, family members that you can
11   specifically remember.  So why don't we talk
12   about that -- there was one vehicle that you
13   mentioned that you worked on at that Argo gas
14   station.  Do you want to tell me about that?
15       A.   About the motor?
16       Q.   And that was your vehicle with the
17   motor?
18       A.   Yeah, I had a 1965 Super Sport.  Every
19   penny I earned I threw in it.  We were going to
20   put this motor in it that we got, so we rebuilt
21   the motor and never put it in it.  Sold it so
22   many years later.
23       Q.   And that was a Chevy?
24       A.   That was a Chevy.
0076
 1       Q.   And the vintage was '65, right?
 2       A.   No, the motor was out of a '68
 3   Corvette.
 4       Q.   The new motor?
 5       A.   Yeah.  It had damaged bearings, so we
 6   took it apart and fixed it all up.
 7       Q.   Okay.
 8       A.   And crankshafts.
 9       Q.   And that work would have been done in
10   the early 1970s?
11       A.   While I was at the Argo station.
12       Q.   Okay.  And do you remember where -- I
13   may have asked this, forgive me if I did, where
14   you purchased any replacement gaskets that you
15   used to do this work?
16       A.   No.
17       Q.   Okay.  Do you remember the brand of
18   those gaskets?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   All right.  So that's -- and you did
21   that in the garage itself or outside?
22       A.   Yeah, in the garage, but I do remember
23   buying gaskets for it because they were
24   expensive.
0077
 1       Q.   Did anyone help you because I think
 2   you said "we"?
 3       A.   Yeah, my brother-in-law.
 4       Q.   Okay.  So we've got that '65 Chevy
 5   Super Sport?
 6       A.   Well, that was the car.  The motor was
 7   a '68 Corvette motor, 427.
 8       Q.   Did you do any other work on that
 9   vehicle?
10       A.   It would be about 15 grand right now
11   if I had it.  Did I do any other work on that
12   vehicle?
13       Q.   Yes.
14       A.   Yeah, I did everything on my car down
15   there.  Painted it.  Put all kinds of new parts
16   on it, dual exhaust, high speed -- high-rise
17   manifold, carburetor.  The car looked like a
18   million bucks.
19       Q.   You said -- did you replace the
20   exhaust?
21       A.   Yeah, put dual exhaust.  I made a dual
22   exhaust out of it.
23       Q.   Do you recall -- this was during the
24   same time period at the garage?
0078
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   Do you recall the brand of any of the
 3   new exhaust parts that you installed?
 4       A.   Not specifically for that car, but I
 5   know we always used to use like Wagner was one
 6   of the mufflers and Walker.  I think it was
 7   Walker, right?
 8       Q.   What was Walker?
 9       A.   Walker was exhaust also.
10       Q.   Okay.  So the two names you just gave
11   me, Wagner and Walker, are brands you kind of
12   generally recall?
13       A.   Yeah.  I mean, you bought a muffler
14   from NAPA.  That's what you were going to get.
15       Q.   Do you remember getting either of
16   those brands of mufflers from NAPA?
17       A.   No.
18       Q.   Okay.
19       A.   Not specifically, but that's what they
20   gave you.
21       Q.   Do you know where you purchased the
22   muffler or any of the exhaust parts?
23       A.   No.
24       Q.   Did you have to install a new gasket
0079
 1   when you were installing the new muffler?
 2       A.   Certain spots, tailpipe, I mean,
 3   engine pipe, there would be a doughnut gasket
 4   at the end of the engine pipe that's connected
 5   to the tailpipe, mid pipe, whatever.  Asbestos
 6   doughnut gaskets about that big, heavy,
 7   flanged-type thing.
 8       Q.   Did they come with the muffler, or did
 9   you buy those separately?
10       A.   You paid separately for those because
11   you could have reused them if you wanted to.
12       Q.   Do you recall the brands of those
13   gaskets?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   Do you know where you purchased them?
16       A.   They came from the parts store with
17   the exhaust parts.
18       Q.   And you don't know where for this
19   vehicle you purchased those exhaust parts; is
20   that true?
21       A.   I don't remember.
22       Q.   Okay.  You said you did some painting.
23   Did you do any bodywork on this vehicle?
24       A.   Yes.
0080
 1       Q.   And what did you do?
 2       A.   Everything.  Every dent, every piece
 3   of rust, cut out the fender wells and put the
 4   tires in it and painted it.
 5       Q.   When you were dealing with dents, did
 6   you ever have to use any body filler?
 7       A.   Yes, Bondo, and there was also a red
 8   putty, came in a tube.  You used that for
 9   finish work.
10       Q.   Do you know where you bought either of
11   those products?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Can you just describe for me how it is
14   that you used the body filler product, just the
15   couple of steps that you might have followed?
16       A.   Well, you got some rust, dent,
17   whatever.  You do the best you can getting rid
18   of the rust and the dent, and you apply your
19   Bondo.  You mix it up with the hardener and
20   apply that like a putty or a paste, smooth as
21   you can get it, let it dry.  And then you plane
22   it down and then sand it down and maybe put a
23   little bit more on there until it looks good.
24       Q.   And that process that you just
0081
 1   described, is that how you would apply body
 2   filler regardless of the vehicle?
 3       A.   Depending how big your damage is.
 4       Q.   So if the dent was larger, would you
 5   put more?
 6       A.   You might have to put a piece of sheet
 7   metal over it.
 8       Q.   Okay.  But as far as when you were
 9   working with the body filler product, those are
10   the steps that you followed?
11       A.   Yeah, that I can recall.
12       Q.   Okay.
13       A.   It was a long time ago.
14       Q.   And I think the answer may be that it
15   depends on the size, but could you approximate
16   how long it is that you spent sanding the body
17   filler?
18       A.   Depending how big the damage is.  You
19   sand it fairly simply.  It's fairly soft
20   material.  You had sanding boards.  You had
21   different tools, you know.  You had like
22   screen -- I forget what they're called now but
23   like a rasp-type thing for when it was really
24   rough, you know, you knock all the heavy stuff
0082
 1   off.
 2       Q.   So you'd first use a rasp to sand it
 3   down?
 4       A.   If it was bad enough, yeah.
 5       Q.   And then you'd use sandpaper?
 6       A.   Yeah, you could use paper.  We didn't
 7   have that many power tools back then.
 8       Q.   And that work was done at the Argo gas
 9   station as well?
10       A.   I believe so, yeah.
11       Q.   Okay.
12       A.   I just -- I mean, I might be running
13   into the other gas station, too.
14       Q.   But it was around that same time
15   period?
16       A.   Yeah.  I mean, I got the car -- I got
17   the car around June of '72, so it would have
18   been the end of the Argo -- it would have been
19   the end of the Argo experience, you know.
20       Q.   You also mentioned doing some
21   carburetor work on this vehicle.  Did that
22   involve a gasket as well?
23       A.   Sure.
24       Q.   And do you recall the brand of gasket
0083
 1   that you removed?
 2       A.   No.
 3       Q.   Or that you installed?
 4       A.   No.
 5       Q.   Do you know where you purchased it?
 6       A.   No.
 7       Q.   Okay.  Any other work you remember on
 8   this Chevy Super Sport?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   Can you recall any other vehicles that
11   you've done brake work, clutch work, gasket
12   work, bodywork, muffler work on?
13       A.   Yeah, probably every vehicle I owned
14   back in the day.  You know, I had a -- after
15   that I got rid of cars that were costing me
16   money, so I had a '66 Polaris.  I don't recall
17   specifically what cars I did what work on, no.
18       Q.   Are you able to tell me about the time
19   frame in which you were doing this type of work
20   on your vehicles, the first time you would have
21   worked on one of your vehicles to the last time
22   you would have worked on one of your vehicles;
23   is that possible?
24       A.   I worked on cars until probably 20
0084
 1   years ago, you know.
 2       Q.   Would the first time you worked on a
 3   vehicle have been the Chevy Super Sport we were
 4   just talking about?
 5       A.   That I worked on a vehicle, probably
 6   not.
 7       Q.   That was yours, not associated with
 8   the garage?
 9       A.   That was mine, yes, probably that was
10   mine.
11       Q.   Okay.  Are you able to tell me about
12   how many times you would have replaced brakes
13   on one of your own vehicles, the total number
14   of times you would have done that?
15       A.   Less than ten.
16       Q.   Are you able to tell me the brands of
17   any of the new brakes that you installed on any
18   of your vehicles?
19       A.   Well, we just went over it a minute
20   ago.
21       Q.   The same brands?
22       A.   Yes.  I can't recall the names now.
23       Q.   That's okay.  And if you want, I could
24   read them back to you, but is it your memory
0085
 1   that the brands that we were talking about
 2   earlier, you also installed those on your
 3   personal vehicles?
 4       A.   Yeah.
 5       Q.   Okay.
 6       A.   I mean, we did a brake job on my
 7   wife's car a few months ago, you know, so the
 8   stuff is still going.  If I can save 600
 9   dollars by doing a brake job, I'd probably save
10   600 dollars.  I forgot.  I still monkey around
11   with the stuff once in a while.
12       Q.   Taking aside the brake job that you
13   just mentioned that was very recently, thinking
14   back to any automotive work you did in the
15   '70s, in the '80s, do you know where you would
16   have purchased replacement brakes from?
17       A.   From those parts stores that I
18   mentioned.
19       Q.   The same parts stores that you
20   mentioned?
21       A.   Yes, the same three or four stores.
22       Q.   Do you have a specific memory of
23   purchasing a particular part from a particular
24   store --
0086
 1       A.   No.
 2       Q.   -- for a particular vehicle?
 3       A.   Sorry, no.
 4       Q.   Okay.  You mentioned kind of toward
 5   the beginning when I was asking you about the
 6   parts stores that you recalled going to with
 7   the gas stations, you started listing them, and
 8   you said maybe Western Auto, and then you said
 9   you didn't really recall Western Auto in
10   connection with the gas stations.
11            I want to kind of get an
12   understanding.  Do you recall ever going to a
13   Western Auto store?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Okay.  And can you tell me what for
16   and when it was that you did that?
17       A.   Downtown Southington had a Western
18   Auto store, and I've been there many times.
19   I'm trying to recall if I ever bought
20   automobile parts there.  I can't come up with
21   an answer.
22       Q.   Is it your memory that Western Auto
23   kind of sold everything; it was kind of a
24   precursor to --
0087
 1       A.   General store.
 2       Q.   Right, like, it sold clothing and
 3   appliances and things like that?
 4       A.   Toys, sporting goods.
 5       Q.   Okay.  And my understanding is that
 6   you recalled going to a Western Auto store in
 7   downtown Southington, right?
 8       A.   Yeah.
 9       Q.   But you don't recall whether you ever
10   purchased an automotive part from that store?
11       A.   Correct.
12            MS. VELLUCCI:  Okay.  Why don't we
13   take a quick break.
14            MR. MEISENKOTHEN:  Sure.
15            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
16   11:17 a.m.

21       Q.   Sir, are you ready to continue on a
22   little bit longer?
23       A.   Yes, I am.
24       Q.   Okay.  I want to ask you something I
0088
 1   think I've asked, but I just want to make sure
 2   I've exhausted your memory on this.  And can
 3   you recall any other vehicles outside of
 4   vehicles you worked on in connection with the
 5   gas stations, so any other vehicles that you've
 6   done work on in your lifetime?
 7       A.   Yes.
 8       Q.   Can you recall them specifically?
 9       A.   When I was working at the Precision
10   Grinding after January '73, I worked on a
11   couple cars there.  One was for my wife, my
12   future wife.  I bought a car with a blown motor
13   in it and fixed it up, put a motor in it and
14   all that.
15            And then I also did a car for my
16   buddy.  We did a motor on a car.  And for some
17   reason, I can't remember now if it was a Pinto
18   or a Vega, two pieces of junk cars, but for
19   some reason my wires are getting crossed if it
20   was a Pinto or a Vega, but we did a motor job
21   on it.  We took the motor out of the car, took
22   the whole motor apart and put it back together
23   and the car ran, so we were successful.
24       Q.   Let me ask you then since we're still
0089
 1   on that about that car for your friend.  What
 2   was the make of the vehicle, do you know that?
 3       A.   I'm trying to recall if it was a Chevy
 4   or a Ford.
 5       Q.   Okay.
 6       A.   I think it was -- I'm not going to
 7   answer that because I can't recall right now.
 8   Tomorrow I'll remember.
 9       Q.   If you do, if you remember it, just
10   interrupt me and let me know.  Okay?
11       A.   Yeah.
12       Q.   When did you do that motor work?
13       A.   Sometime after 1973.
14       Q.   Was it while you were at the Precision
15   Grinding?
16       A.   Correct.
17       Q.   And my understanding from some written
18   discovery received in this case from your
19   attorney is that you worked at Precision
20   Grinding from '73 to '75.  So would it be in
21   that time frame?
22       A.   Yeah, but I thought I worked a little
23   bit longer than that.  That was maybe when I
24   worked full-time.  I did, yeah.  I worked for
0090
 1   '73 to '75, then I was gone for a year, then I
 2   came back in '76.  I came back in '77.
 3            I was gone for a year, and then I
 4   became a cop.  And I still worked part-time
 5   there for a couple years.
 6       Q.   Okay.  And I'll ask you some follow-up
 7   about that in a little bit.  But just kind of
 8   thinking about this car, which friend did you
 9   do this work for?
10       A.   Ron Naper.
11       Q.   Is he still with us today?
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   Where does he live?
14       A.   Southington.
15       Q.   Is he about your age?
16       A.   He's 78.
17       Q.   Okay.  And you described the work you
18   did.  Where did you do that work?
19       A.   At the garage at the shop.
20       Q.   At Precision Grinding?
21       A.   Correct.
22       Q.   Did he help you?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   Do you recall the brand name, trade
0091
 1   name, or manufacturer of any gaskets that you
 2   removed in connection with this work?
 3       A.   No.
 4       Q.   Do you recall the brand name, trade
 5   name, or manufacturer of any of the gaskets you
 6   installed?
 7       A.   No.
 8       Q.   Did you purchase the parts, the
 9   replacement parts, or did he?
10       A.   I don't recall.
11       Q.   Do you recall where they were from?
12       A.   Don't recall.
13       Q.   All right.  And then you mentioned
14   doing some work on your soon-to-be wife's car
15   in '73; is that what you said, or it was while
16   you were at Precision Grinding anyway?
17       A.   That would have been in '74 since I
18   already had a new car in '74.  I had to keep
19   her from driving my car.
20       Q.   Okay.  What kind of car did she have
21   that you did this work on?
22       A.   American Motors Ambassador.
23       Q.   And you said you did -- the car had a
24   blown motor, so what did you have to do?
0092
 1       A.   Bought a used motor.
 2       Q.   Where did you get the used motor from?
 3       A.   I believe it was Terryville Auto
 4   Parts, Terryville Junkyard.
 5       Q.   It was a junkyard?
 6       A.   Yes.
 7       Q.   Okay.  And did you have to purchase
 8   any replacement gaskets to install the new
 9   motor?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   Where did you get those?
12       A.   Don't recall.
13       Q.   Do you recall the brand of those
14   gaskets?
15       A.   Don't recall.
16       Q.   Did you do any other work on this
17   vehicle that your wife owned?
18       A.   Brakes, tires, paint.
19       Q.   Anything else?
20       A.   Well, when you buy a used motor that
21   was in a crash, I remember specifically the oil
22   pan had to be changed on it.  It had a big hole
23   in it, and the balancer near the crankshaft was
24   busted, had to change that.  Whatever.  Threw
0093
 1   it in the car and fired it up and it worked.
 2       Q.   When you changed out the oil pan, did
 3   you have to replace the gasket, too?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Do you recall where you purchased the
 6   new gasket?
 7       A.   No.
 8       Q.   Do you recall the brand of it?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   And that's a precut gasket as well?
11       A.   Those are rubber.
12       Q.   Oh, those are rubber, okay.
13            What about the brakes?  You said you
14   changed the brakes on this vehicle?
15       A.   Yeah.
16       Q.   When did you do that, also during that
17   time?
18       A.   During the process.
19       Q.   Around '74?
20       A.   Yeah, it had to be '74.
21       Q.   Did you do that work at the shop at
22   Precision Grinding?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   Did you do two wheels or four wheels?
0094
 1       A.   I don't recall.
 2       Q.   Were they drum brakes or disc brakes?
 3       A.   I believe the rears were drums.  I
 4   don't recall.  1968 car.
 5       Q.   Did anyone help you with that brake
 6   job?
 7       A.   I don't recall.
 8       Q.   Do you recall --
 9       A.   We could assume that Pat Bruschino
10   helped me with everything on the car.
11       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall the brand of
12   brakes that you removed from this vehicle?
13       A.   No.
14       Q.   What about the brakes that you
15   installed?
16       A.   No.
17       Q.   Do you know where you purchased the
18   replacement brakes?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   Did you perform this brake job in the
21   same manner as you described when I asked you
22   earlier how you generally did brake work?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   Okay.  And was there an air hose at
0095
 1   Precision Grinding?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   So you would have used it in the same
 4   manner as you previously described?
 5       A.   Well, this was 1974.  We might have
 6   been smarter then.
 7       Q.   So by this time in 1974, is it your
 8   understanding that you knew that there was some
 9   hazards associated with asbestos?
10       A.   I can't say for sure.
11       Q.   Okay.  If you had known, if this was
12   during that time period after the story you
13   gave me earlier, you wouldn't have used the air
14   hose?
15       A.   No.
16       Q.   I was asking you some questions
17   previously about brakes in general, and I want
18   to ask you some more questions about brakes.
19   You had told me that when you obtained new
20   brakes, they were ordered for that particular
21   make, model year of vehicle, right?
22       A.   Okay.
23       Q.   And that they were meant to fit, and
24   generally, they did fit the vehicle, right?
0096
 1       A.   (Nodding.)
 2       Q.   Is that a yes?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   And do you recall hearing the term
 5   "precision-ground" or "precision-molded"
 6   brakes?
 7       A.   It does sound familiar to me, but I
 8   can't say specifically that I recall it.
 9       Q.   Okay.  So let me just ask you this, do
10   you recall ever working with or installing
11   precision-ground brakes on vehicles?
12       A.   No.
13       Q.   Okay.  And earlier you told me that
14   when you installed brakes, you didn't have to
15   do anything to get them to fit in the vehicle,
16   right?
17       A.   You know, you're bringing back
18   memories and I'm wondering now, but I can't
19   say.
20       Q.   Okay.  So is it your memory then that
21   when you obtained a set of new brakes, you
22   would open the box and the brakes would be in
23   the box, right?
24       A.   Yes.
0097
 1       Q.   And those brakes were ready to install
 2   as is?
 3       A.   I guess so.  That's the only thing I
 4   can remember.  I don't remember having to grind
 5   anything off a brake to make it work.
 6       Q.   Okay.  So you just told me about two
 7   vehicles, your wife's vehicle and the friend's
 8   vehicle.  Are there any other vehicles that
 9   your friends owned or family members owned or
10   that you owned that you did work on?
11       A.   Probably.
12       Q.   Anything, as we sit here today, that
13   you could tell me about, specifically?
14       A.   I always fixed my mother's car.  She
15   was always asking for something.  I always
16   ended up doing it.
17       Q.   Do you have a memory of any work
18   you've done on any of your mother's cars?
19       A.   Yeah, changed the oil, tune it up,
20   changed exhaust pipes.
21       Q.   Do you recall -- do you specifically
22   remember replacing exhaust pipes on one of your
23   mom's cars?
24       A.   Yes.
0098
 1       Q.   Which car or cars did you do that on?
 2       A.   '78 Chevy.
 3       Q.   And when would you have done that
 4   work?
 5       A.   In the '80s.
 6       Q.   Do you recall where you changed the
 7   exhaust pipes?  Was it outside?
 8       A.   Probably in her driveway.
 9       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall the brand of any
10   of the products you removed?
11       A.   No.
12       Q.   What about that you installed?
13       A.   No.
14       Q.   And do you know where you purchased
15   any of the replacement parts for that work?
16       A.   No.
17       Q.   Any other vehicles that you can think
18   of that you've worked on or you've assisted
19   others in working on that we haven't already
20   talked about?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   Okay.  I was asking you before about
23   jobs you held in high school, and then we kind
24   of skipped out of high school and talked about
0099
 1   the Mobil station.
 2            Did you work anywhere else in high
 3   school other than the gas stations, the ski
 4   area, and the farms that we talked about?
 5       A.   I don't believe so.
 6       Q.   Okay.  Do you recall -- give me just
 7   one moment.  Do you recall ever working at a
 8   business called Eddy's?
 9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   Okay.  Was that in high school or
11   after high school?
12       A.   That was after high school.
13       Q.   All right.  When did you work there?
14       A.   Right after high school.  I got hired
15   in June, but I was only 17 so I couldn't work
16   in the factory.  You can only work in the
17   warehouse until I was 18.  That was the most
18   disgusting place I ever worked in my life.
19       Q.   And why was that?
20       A.   Because it was dangerous.
21       Q.   And how was it dangerous?
22       A.   Well, it was Eddy's electric motor
23   repair shop, and they would -- you would take
24   apart a motor, cut it open, and you'd throw it
0100
 1   on a fire and burn all the varnish off with all
 2   the doors and windows closed in the building
 3   because the health department was trying to
 4   shut him down.  The paint was peeling off the
 5   houses in the neighborhood.
 6            So I did that once, and I said I ain't
 7   doing this again, coughing on toxic fumes, but
 8   everything was, you know, 440-amp volts laying
 9   around here and naphtha.  They sprayed naphtha
10   all over everything.  It was disgusting.  And
11   as soon as -- when I turned 18, they put me in
12   there, started teaching me the ropes, and I
13   stayed -- I turned 18 November 23, and right
14   after Christmas I quit.
15       Q.   All right.  Let me ask you just a
16   couple follow-up questions about what you just
17   said.  So you started there in June -- after
18   you graduated high school which was June of
19   '72?
20       A.   Yeah, I cleaned out a warehouse.
21       Q.   So your job was to clean out a
22   warehouse at Eddy's Electric Motor Company?
23       A.   Yeah.
24       Q.   Where was Eddy's located?
0101
 1       A.   The warehouse was on a different
 2   street.
 3       Q.   Where was that?
 4       A.   The warehouse was on, I think it was
 5   called Berlin Street, Berlin Avenue or Berlin
 6   Street.
 7       Q.   And what did you do in order to clean
 8   out the warehouse?  What kind of work were you
 9   doing?
10       A.   It was just all stuff, you know,
11   organizing it.
12       Q.   What was in the warehouse?
13       A.   I don't even remember.
14       Q.   Okay.
15       A.   Junk.
16       Q.   Did you do that work by yourself, or
17   were others working there?
18       A.   By myself.
19       Q.   And then you did that work until you
20   turned 18, which was November 23, 1972?
21       A.   Yeah.
22       Q.   And starting November 23, you were
23   working in the motor shop?
24       A.   Yeah.
0102
 1       Q.   And the motor shop is what you were
 2   just describing to me?
 3       A.   Yeah.
 4       Q.   Okay.  And then you said you quit --
 5   did you say around Christmastime?
 6       A.   Yeah, right after Christmas.
 7       Q.   In '72?
 8       A.   Yeah.
 9       Q.   Okay.  I am going to let someone else
10   ask you some more questions about that, so I'm
11   going to move on to some other questions.
12            I actually want to talk to you a bit
13   about home renovations, home repairs, things of
14   that nature, so I'm switching gears on you a
15   little bit.  And I want to talk to you
16   specifically about the heating system that was
17   at the home that you grew up in, the 17
18   Sunnyridge Drive address.
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Okay.  And what was the heating system
21   there when you were a child when you were
22   growing up?
23       A.   Coal furnace.
24       Q.   Okay.  And my understanding is that
0103
 1   that furnace -- strike that.
 2            Was that -- how long was that furnace
 3   in the home?
 4       A.   The house was built around 1946, and
 5   then this would have been around 1966 when the
 6   furnace failed.  We got carbon monoxide poison
 7   in the house, we fixed it, and the following
 8   year we took it apart.
 9       Q.   Took apart the old furnace?
10       A.   Yeah.
11       Q.   Do you know the brand name,
12   manufacturer, or trade name of that old coal
13   furnace?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   Okay.  So you said in -- did it fail
16   in '66, and you took it apart in '66?
17       A.   It failed, like, the year before.  It
18   had a hole through the burn chamber so carbon
19   monoxide was going right into the heating ducts
20   so ...
21       Q.   Go ahead.
22       A.   I'm done.
23       Q.   Did you assist in taking it apart or
24   dismantling the old coal furnace?
0104
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   And what did that entail?
 3       A.   Sledgehammer.
 4       Q.   Where was the furnace located?
 5       A.   Basement.
 6       Q.   How long did it take to dismantle that
 7   furnace?
 8       A.   Don't recall.
 9       Q.   Was it hours, days, a week?
10       A.   A couple of days.
11       Q.   Did you do that alone, or did anyone
12   help you?
13       A.   Under the direction of my father.
14       Q.   Okay.  Was he supervising, or was he
15   in there with a sledgehammer taking it apart,
16   too?
17       A.   He might have helped a little.
18       Q.   But it was primarily your job?
19       A.   (Nodding.)
20       Q.   Is that a yes?
21       A.   Yes.
22       Q.   Okay.  And was the furnace insulated?
23       A.   I believe it was because it had a
24   jacket on it.
0105
 1       Q.   So there was some sort of a metal
 2   jacket on the outside?
 3       A.   Yes.
 4       Q.   And there was some sort of an
 5   insulation underneath the jacket?
 6       A.   I believe so, yes.
 7       Q.   Okay.  And in your sledgehammering
 8   that furnace, did that cause you to disturb
 9   that insulation?
10       A.   I believe so.
11       Q.   Okay.  How did you take the pieces of
12   the furnace -- how did you remove them from the
13   basement?
14       A.   Threw them out the cellar window.
15       Q.   Did you do that?
16       A.   Yes.
17       Q.   And then you threw it out the window,
18   and then what happened to those pieces?
19       A.   It was discarded in some manner.
20       Q.   Did you have anything to do with those
21   pieces after you threw them out the window?
22       A.   I'm sure I did.
23       Q.   Do you remember taking them to like a
24   dump or a dumpster?
0106
 1       A.   I don't recall.
 2       Q.   Okay.  When you were sledgehammering
 3   this old furnace, did that create dust?
 4       A.   I have a visual of it, yes.
 5       Q.   And what does that visual look like?
 6       A.   Choking on dust and dirt and coal
 7   ashes.
 8       Q.   And that was over the course of a
 9   couple of days, you said?
10       A.   Yes.
11       Q.   And how many hours a day would you
12   spend down there with the sledgehammer
13   dismantling the furnace?
14       A.   I don't recall.
15       Q.   Can you tell me the size of the
16   basement that this furnace was located in?
17       A.   Yes.  I want to say 680 square feet
18   for some reason.  The whole house was four
19   rooms, smaller than this room and those rooms
20   together, so I believe it was 680.  It could be
21   800.  Fairly small.
22       Q.   Okay.  And that's your best estimate?
23       A.   Yeah, fairly small.
24       Q.   Was it all open, or was the furnace in
0107
 1   its own room?
 2       A.   The furnace was in the middle of the
 3   room.
 4       Q.   And it was open to the whole basement?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   And how far was the window that you
 7   threw out the pieces from where the furnace
 8   was?
 9       A.   10 feet.
10       Q.   And did you take the pieces into your
11   hands and physically carry them --
12       A.   Yes.
13       Q.   -- to the window?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   Did you wear gloves?
16       A.   Don't recall.
17       Q.   Okay.  Did you wear any protective
18   clothing?
19       A.   Don't -- no.
20       Q.   Did you wear a mask?
21       A.   No.
22       Q.   And then my understanding is that a
23   new heating system was installed after this one
24   was removed?
0108
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   And would that have been in around
 3   1966?
 4       A.   Yes.
 5       Q.   Do you recall the brand name, trade
 6   name, or manufacturer of the new heating
 7   system?
 8       A.   No.
 9       Q.   Was it a boiler?  Was it a furnace, do
10   you know?
11       A.   The tankless oil boiler.
12       Q.   Do you know where the new boiler was
13   purchased, where it came from?
14       A.   No.
15       Q.   And who installed the new boiler?
16       A.   I and my father.
17       Q.   Was that boiler -- did it have a
18   jacket as well?
19       A.   Yes.
20       Q.   Did it have the insulation underneath
21   the jacket?
22       A.   Yes.
23       Q.   Can you tell me how it is you went
24   about installing that boiler?
0109
 1       A.   Well, it was baseboard heat, so every
 2   piece of baseboard in the house, I cut it and
 3   soldered it.  And he had the brains and I had
 4   the -- I did all the work.
 5       Q.   Okay.
 6       A.   I was a sixth grader.
 7       Q.   Did the boiler itself, did it come in
 8   one piece, or were there multiple pieces that
 9   you had to --
10       A.   One piece.  It was one piece,
11   approximately -- it's taller than the stand
12   right in front of me.
13       Q.   And about how tall would you estimate
14   that is?
15       A.   Well, that looks about 30 inches, but
16   a little taller than that.
17       Q.   So about 3 feet tall?
18       A.   I mean, approximately 3 feet tall.
19       Q.   Okay.  And in installing the new
20   boiler, did you have to do any work with
21   gaskets or anything to assemble any pieces that
22   connected to the boiler?
23       A.   When you cleaned it, you did.
24       Q.   Okay.  But the installation didn't
0110
 1   involve any of that work?
 2       A.   Probably the exhaust on top was sealed
 3   with asbestos cement.
 4       Q.   Did you have to seal the exhaust on
 5   top?
 6       A.   I'm trying to remember.  You sealed
 7   everything, you know.
 8       Q.   So that's something that you would
 9   have done?
10       A.   Yes, if it required it.
11       Q.   And how do you know the cement that
12   you were working with was asbestos cement?
13       A.   Because everything was.  I don't
14   specifically know.
15       Q.   Do you know what color it was, do you
16   remember?
17       A.   Gray.
18       Q.   Was there ever a time when the cement
19   that was on the -- that was there sealing the
20   exhaust had to ever be scraped off or removed?
21       A.   Every year we cleaned it.
22       Q.   Okay.  And can you tell me what you
23   did to clean that boiler?
24       A.   You removed the exhaust.  I believe it
0111
 1   was probably 6-inch pipe, exhaust that went on
 2   top of it.  You pull that out of the chimney,
 3   and then you pull the metal cap off.
 4            And then under that, you had all
 5   these -- you had these fins you pulled out of
 6   these slots.  And you took the cover off and
 7   you cleaned all the fins and you vacuumed out
 8   the inside, and then you put the asbestos back
 9   on the top to seal it.  You got a new gasket on
10   top to seal it.
11            I'm trying to remember.  I'm getting a
12   little hazy on that, how exactly we did it, but
13   I know there was asbestos rope -- it was like a
14   rope we put in the top.
15       Q.   Was the asbestos rope the gasket, or
16   is the gasket something else?
17       A.   That was the gasket.
18       Q.   Okay.  And how is it that you believe
19   that the rope was asbestos?
20       A.   I knew it, I guess.
21       Q.   What color was it?
22       A.   It was grayish.
23       Q.   Did you have to -- every time you
24   cleaned the boiler, did you have to remove the
0112
 1   rope?
 2       A.   Yes.
 3       Q.   Would you install the same rope?
 4       A.   I think we tried to save it sometimes,
 5   but we wet it.  We would wet it, and it would
 6   get -- there would be carbon mess, and it would
 7   get crappy there.  I think we reused it
 8   sometimes.
 9       Q.   And sometimes you'd have to replace
10   it?
11       A.   Yeah.
12       Q.   Did you ever have to cut or trim the
13   rope?
14       A.   I'm certain we did.  I would -- yeah,
15   it's a guess.
16       Q.   Okay.  Is it your belief that that's
17   something you did with that boiler?
18       A.   Yes.
19       Q.   You mentioned that -- strike that.
20            Did you have to put the asbestos
21   cement in more than one place on the boiler?
22       A.   Not that I recall.
23       Q.   Okay.  Did you put the asbestos cement
24   on the boiler every year?
0113
 1       A.   Yes.
 2       Q.   The cement that you were using, did
 3   that come -- was that a dry product that you
 4   mixed, or was it a premixed wet product?
 5       A.   I could be wrong here.  Maybe the
 6   stuff that went on -- that you sealed the pipe
 7   with wasn't asbestos.  Maybe it was just a
 8   concrete product.  I don't recall.  I don't
 9   know what that was made out of.  I know the
10   gasket was asbestos because of the heat and all
11   that, but I don't know about the top stuff.  I
12   mean, there's cements -- there's furnace
13   cements and all that that aren't asbestos.
14       Q.   And as we sit here today, you just
15   don't know one way or the other?
16       A.   Yeah, I'm not sure on that.
17       Q.   And you never had the product tested,
18   did you?
19       A.   No.
20       Q.   Okay.  Did you ever have to either
21   sand or scrape or remove the cement from that
22   boiler?
23       A.   Yeah.
24       Q.   How often did you do that?
0114
 1       A.   Every year when you did the job.
 2       Q.   How long would that take?
 3       A.   Not long at all.  Minutes.
 4       Q.   I'm sorry?
 5       A.   Minutes.
 6       Q.   What did you use to remove the cement,
 7   what kind of a tool?
 8       A.   Some type of scraping device.
 9       Q.   When you used the scraping device on
10   the cement, did it create dust?
11       A.   I'm not sure.
12       Q.   Did it come off in multiple pieces as
13   you were scraping?
14       A.   Yes.
15       Q.   And did that -- did the pieces fall to
16   the floor?
17       A.   They stayed on top, and we picked them
18   up.
19       Q.   With your hands?
20       A.   Yeah.
21       Q.   Did anything get on the floor so you'd
22   have to sweep it up?
23       A.   When you were all done, you had a
24   mess.
0115
 1       Q.   And you'd sweep that up?
 2       A.   Correct.
 3       Q.   And was that dusty?
 4       A.   I would assume.  I don't know.
 5       Q.   When you -- where would you get the
 6   replacement rope, the gasket?
 7       A.   That would be another guess.
 8       Q.   And I don't want you to guess.  If you
 9   know, that's good.
10       A.   I don't know.
11       Q.   Okay.
12       A.   I know there was a local store that we
13   bought stuff from.
14       Q.   What about the cement, do you know
15   where you purchased that?
16       A.   I don't know.  I'm just saying there
17   was a local plumbing and heating store that we
18   frequented.
19       Q.   Do you know how many times you would
20   work with the rope?  Was that annually as well?
21       A.   That was every year.
22       Q.   And I think I started to ask you this
23   and I think we got sidetracked a little bit.
24   The cement that you installed, did that come
0116
 1   premixed, or was that a dry product that you
 2   added water to?
 3       A.   The rope?
 4       Q.   Not the rope.  The cement.
 5       A.   I don't know.  I don't recall.  I
 6   know -- like I said before, I'm not even sure
 7   it was an asbestos product, but I know we
 8   always used to finish off sealing the top off,
 9   you know.
10            Actually, I don't think it was that
11   crucial because there was a positive airflow,
12   so it wasn't like -- the chimney was sucking
13   everything up, so it's not like this had to be
14   super sealed.
15       Q.   Did you do this work that you
16   described with the cement and the rope?  You
17   said it was annual.  Did you do that every year
18   until you moved out in 1977?
19       A.   I did it a long time.  I don't recall
20   until when.  She had a new furnace put in at
21   one time.  That's when I stopped.
22       Q.   That was your mom?  Your mom had a new
23   furnace installed?
24       A.   Yeah.
0117
 1       Q.   Was that after you moved out?
 2       A.   Oh, yeah.
 3       Q.   Did you continue to do this annual
 4   cleaning of the furnace after you moved out?
 5       A.   Yes.
 6       Q.   So you did it through 1977, the
 7   cleaning that we just talked about?
 8       A.   Yeah.
 9       Q.   And then you did this annual
10   maintenance sometime after 1977 as well?
11       A.   Yeah.
12       Q.   Okay.  What else was in the basement?
13   Was it a finished basement, an unfinished
14   basement?
15       A.   No, unfinished.
16       Q.   And was there anything else down
17   there?  Was there laundry?  Was there like a
18   rec room, anything like that?
19       A.   Laundry.
20       Q.   Did you ever go downstairs into the
21   basement to do laundry while you were living
22   there?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And where was the laundry in relation
0118
 1   to that boiler?
 2       A.   Boiler was in the southern room.
 3   Laundry was in the eastern wall.
 4       Q.   About how many feet away?
 5       A.   A dozen, ten.
 6       Q.   Would you say that you were downstairs
 7   in that basement on a daily basis while you
 8   lived there?
 9       A.   No.
10       Q.   How often were you downstairs?
11       A.   A few times a week.
12       Q.   All right.  Thinking still about the
13   home at 17 Sunnyridge Drive, can you think of
14   any other types of home renovation, repair
15   work, construction work that you did or you
16   helped someone do at that home?
17       A.   Yes.
18       Q.   And what's that?
19       A.   Glazing windows.
20       Q.   Okay.  I will let someone else ask
21   some more detailed questions about that, but if
22   you could just tell me the time frame?  Was it
23   the entire time you lived there?
24       A.   Let's put it mildly, my old man didn't
0119
 1   do shit at home.  I did everything, okay.  So
 2   if there was something that had to be done, I
 3   had to do it.  So if there was a busted window,
 4   if there was something that had to be -- you
 5   know, the putty was falling out of the window,
 6   I did the glazing.
 7            Since I was a little shit, I did
 8   everything.  So he'd send me down to the
 9   hardware store, tell me to get a pane of glass.
10   I'd get the pane of glass.  I'd come home, I'd
11   put it in.
12       Q.   Okay.
13       A.   All right.  So that's just the way it
14   was.  So everything that happened, every repair
15   that was on that house I did it at one time or
16   the other.  I sided that house when I was in
17   high school.  I did basically everything you
18   could think about.  And, you know, part of it
19   was all the windows.  I mean, I did it -- like,
20   in the '70s I did -- in the early '70s I glazed
21   all the windows, you know, what needed to be
22   done, popped out all the loose glazing and got
23   my DAP and simple job once you do a few
24   windows.
0120
 1       Q.   Okay.
 2       A.   So I did -- that's what I did.
 3       Q.   And you said you sided the house.  Did
 4   you remove the siding that was existing?
 5       A.   It had asphalt siding on it.  It was
 6   probably asbestos siding, too.  We covered it
 7   with vinyl.
 8       Q.   Did you remove the existing siding, or
 9   did you just put vinyl on top of it?
10       A.   We left it.  No, I don't even know.  I
11   don't even know.
12       Q.   Do you recall when it is that you did
13   the siding at this house?
14       A.   1972, high school, just getting out of
15   high school.
16       Q.   Okay.  And you said that the siding
17   that existed on the house was probably asbestos
18   siding.  Why do you say that?
19       A.   It was probably -- it was asphalt.  It
20   was this black stuff.  It was really thick and
21   really textured outside like shingles.  I think
22   it was asphalt, not asbestos, but I'm trying to
23   remember if we took the stuff off or not.  I
24   think we did because it was too thick on the
0121
 1   windows.
 2       Q.   Did you remove the siding from the
 3   entire house or just around the windows?
 4       A.   No, I think we did the whole house.
 5       Q.   How long did that take you to do?
 6       A.   A few weeks.
 7       Q.   Did anyone help you?
 8       A.   Yeah, he had some drunk buddy that
 9   would set us up every day.
10       Q.   And the "he" is your father?
11       A.   Yeah.
12       Q.   Do you remember the buddy's name?
13       A.   He'd come over and have a few beers
14   and tell you how to trim a window.  Oh, the
15   pleasant memories.
16       Q.   Do you remember the friend's name?
17       A.   Stanley, the roofer.  Stanley
18   Wosinowski or something like that.
19       Q.   Would you be able to tell me the brand
20   of the existing siding?
21       A.   No, it's vinyl.
22       Q.   That's what you installed?
23       A.   Yeah.
24       Q.   And there's no way to know the brand
0122
 1   of the siding that was existing on the house?
 2       A.   If I went over the house and pulled
 3   the piece off, I could tell you.
 4       Q.   Who lives there now at that address,
 5   do you know?
 6       A.   We finally got rid of it.  Somebody
 7   bought it.
 8       Q.   When was it sold?
 9       A.   It was just sold this year.
10       Q.   In 2018?
11       A.   Yeah.
12       Q.   And did your mom own it up until 2018?
13       A.   Yeah, we tried forever to give it
14   away.  They finally took it.
15       Q.   So it was a private sale?
16       A.   It's a nightmare.  The whole thing was
17   a nightmare.  My sister living in another state
18   and passed away five years ago arranged
19   mortgages for my sister living there and taking
20   care of her.  We had no idea this house was
21   upside down.  It was a nightmare.
22       Q.   But regardless, you don't own it?
23       A.   No.  And you know what, I basically
24   took care of that house for -- until three
0123
 1   years ago.  I had enough.
 2       Q.   Did you ever do any -- again, thinking
 3   about that same home, any drywall or sheetrock
 4   or joint compound work?
 5       A.   All the time.
 6       Q.   Okay.  And what did you do?
 7       A.   Fixed the holes that the old man made.
 8       Q.   And do you remember around the first
 9   time you would have done that type of work,
10   repairing holes?
11       A.   I was a kid.
12       Q.   And did that continue for the entire
13   time you lived there through 1977?
14       A.   Like I said, whenever there was a
15   problem, I fixed it.  I'm not saying holes all
16   the time, but he made holes.  He punched walls.
17       Q.   Can you tell me how it is you went
18   about repairing the holes?
19       A.   A sheetrock hole?
20       Q.   Yes.
21       A.   Simple.  Just find out where your hole
22   is, find out where your stud is, go wide enough
23   to get halfway into your stud, cut the
24   sheetrock off half of the stud.  Cut the
0124
 1   sheetrock off the other half of the stud, you
 2   know, make your square piece, whatever it is,
 3   and cut your new sheetrock and fit it in there
 4   so it's overlapping on two studs.  Throw a
 5   couple of screws in there to hold it in place.
 6   Get your mud.  Get your tape.  Put some mud
 7   down.  Put some tape down.  Let it dry.  Do it
 8   again.  Do it again.
 9       Q.   All right.  Let me ask you a couple of
10   quick follow-up questions.  About the
11   sheetrock, do you know the brand name, trade
12   name, or manufacturer of the sheetrock you were
13   working with?
14       A.   No, but if you pop it on me, I'm going
15   to say, oh, yeah.
16       Q.   But, as you sit here today, you don't
17   know?
18       A.   No.  Didn't it all come from Canada,
19   if I'm not mistaken?  I don't know.
20       Q.   Were you cutting the sheetrock that
21   was already in the wall just to kind of make a
22   better shape?
23       A.   Yeah.
24       Q.   And then would you buy sheetrock to
0125
 1   put into the gap?
 2       A.   Yeah.
 3       Q.   And did you have to cut that sheetrock
 4   as well to fit it?
 5       A.   Yeah.
 6       Q.   What did you use to cut the sheetrock
 7   with?
 8       A.   Utility knife.
 9       Q.   And did that create dust?
10       A.   Oh, yeah, you took a -- go ahead.
11       Q.   And then you said you used mud and you
12   used tape?
13       A.   Yeah.
14       Q.   Do you know the brand name, trade
15   name, or manufacturer of the mud that you used?
16       A.   The joint compound?
17       Q.   Yes.
18       A.   It's flying around up there
19   somewheres.
20       Q.   As you sit here today, you don't know?
21       A.   I can go downstairs and tell you.
22       Q.   How so?
23       A.   I've got a bucket down there.
24       Q.   It's the same type of product that you
0126
 1   used back at your mother's home?
 2       A.   Yeah.
 3       Q.   Do you know the brand of the tape that
 4   you used?
 5       A.   No.
 6       Q.   Do you know where you would have
 7   purchased the sheetrock, the mud, or the tape?
 8       A.   The stuff that I have over here I got
 9   from Home Depot.  The old, you know, stuff I
10   would have had before I would have got from
11   either Southington Hardware or Parker's
12   Hardware in Plantsville.  That was a long time
13   ago.  Even Kmart used to sell the stuff.
14       Q.   After you applied the mud and the
15   tape, you said you would let it dry and you'd
16   do it again?
17       A.   Oh, yeah.
18       Q.   How many times would you kind of go
19   through that for a particular hole?
20       A.   It depends on how good you are.
21       Q.   And how good were you?
22       A.   I got good at it.  I did all the
23   windows -- not these rooms, but all these other
24   rooms I changed the windows because we had
0127
 1   windows like across the street like ranch
 2   windows.  I pulled all those out and, you know,
 3   depends on how good you are.  Practice makes
 4   perfect.
 5       Q.   Back then in the '70s or even in the
 6   '60s when you were doing this, do you know how
 7   many times you would have -- how many layers,
 8   in other words, you would have had to apply?
 9       A.   No, a couple, two or three layers.
10   There's a little bit -- the more you do it, you
11   just put a little bit more on.  You feather it
12   in, you know, because the more you put on, the
13   more you've got to take off.
14       Q.   Did you have to do anything to the
15   first layer before you applied the second
16   layer?
17       A.   Let it dry.
18       Q.   And did you have to do anything after
19   it dried?
20       A.   All depended on how good you were.
21       Q.   Do you remember, for the work you did,
22   did you have to do anything after it dried?
23       A.   Yeah, you played with it.  You played
24   with it until it looked good, until it felt
0128
 1   smooth, so you could step back and not see an
 2   imperfection.
 3       Q.   And how did you do that?  How did you
 4   make it smooth?
 5       A.   By putting the right amount of
 6   compound on it and by sanding it.  They have
 7   these screen devices; it's like you buy one at
 8   Home Depot.  It's a sanding device on a pole.
 9       Q.   So you would use like a pole sander?
10       A.   Yeah.  It sands very easily, then of
11   course, you end up sucking it in, which isn't
12   good.
13            MS. VELLUCCI:  All right.  Let's take
14   a break, sir.  Thank you.

            2                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Good morning.  This is

            3  the start of the deposition of Barry Bell.  We are now on

            4  record at 9:39 a.m. on August 30th, 2019.

            5                This is for the Case Number DC-18-04574

            6  titled Jamex Marketing, LLC, versus Whiting Petroleum

            7  Company, et al. versus James Ballengee.

            8                Will counsel please identify yourselves,

            9  state any agreements on record, after which the court

           10  reporter will swear in the witness.

           11                MR. MARKETOS:  Pete Marketos, Reese

           12  Marketos for Jamex.

           13                MR. CARLIS:  Adam Carlis, Susman Godfrey,

           14  Whiting.

           15                         BARRY BELL,

           16  having been first duly sworn to tell the truth, the whole

           17  truth, and nothing but the truth, so help him God,

           18  testified as follows:

           19                         EXAMINATION

           20  BY MR. CARLIS:

           21       Q.  Morning, Mr. Bell.

           22       A.  Good morning.

           23       Q.  Has any court ever determined that your expert

           24  analysis was unreliable?

           25       A.  Not to my knowledge, no.

                                                                       6



            1       Q.  So in each case where your expert report has

            2  been challenged by the opposing side, the Court has

            3  determined that you could testify on the issues in your

            4  report --

            5                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection --

            6       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  -- is that true?

            7                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            8       A.  No, I don't believe that's true.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  So sometimes the Court has

           10  determined that you couldn't testify on the issues in

           11  your report, true?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  In what cases has the Court ruled that you

           14  could not testify on some of the issues in your report?

           15       A.  I believe the only time that has occurred is in

           16  a case where I was retained by Recursion Software, and

           17  ultimately the Fifth Circuit vacated that order -- the

           18  exclusion order, to be clear.

           19       Q.  And you said the name of that case was

           20  Recursion Software; is that right?

           21       A.  Correct.

           22       Q.  Other than the Recursion Software case, you've

           23  been allowed to testify to the opinions in your report

           24  every time you've submitted a report; is that true?

           25       A.  I recall a case where the judge determined that

                                                                       7



            1  by the time the case got to trial, that the subject of my

            2  report didn't require expert testimony.  It was not that

            3  I did anything wrong or inappropriate or that my opinion

            4  was unreliable.

            5                The judge felt that it was in her purview

            6  to determine damages if it got to a point of damages on

            7  that case.

            8       Q.  What was the name of that case?

            9       A.  Carol Loper, L-o-p-e-r, & Associates was the

           10  plaintiff and my client in that matter.

           11       Q.  And who was the judge in that case?

           12       A.  I don't recall.

           13       Q.  State or federal court?

           14       A.  We could look at my bio.  That case is listed

           15  on my bio.  I was deposed in the case.  It was state

           16  court, to answer that question.

           17                (Deposition Exhibit 236 marked for

           18                 identification.)

           19       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  I'm marking, just for

           20  identification, your report as 236.

           21                Did I give you one copy or two just now?

           22       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  Well, looks like one.

           23       Q.  I've got an extra copy, so we're good.

           24                Can you go ahead and find that Carol Lopez

           25  case for me.

                                                                       8



            1       A.  Just to be clear, it was Carol Loper.

            2       Q.  Loper.

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Thank you.

            5       A.  It's on page 9 of my bio, which is Exhibit A --

            6  I'm sorry, at Exhi- -- yeah, Exhibit A to my report, and

            7  it's the second bullet point.

            8       Q.  And is it accurate to say that in the Carol

            9  Loper case the Court decided that it did not need expert

           10  testimony on damages and therefore you did not testify in

           11  the case?

           12       A.  That was my understanding, yes.

           13       Q.  And other than the two cases you've mentioned,

           14  have there been any other cases where the Court has

           15  determined that for one reason or another you could not

           16  testify on some or all of the issues in your expert

           17  report?

           18       A.  I recall a case in the Eastern District of

           19  Texas that the Court said I couldn't opine -- or I

           20  couldn't testify to legal opinions, which I never attempt

           21  to do and didn't intend to include and don't believe I

           22  did include any legal opinions in my report, but I

           23  testified at that trial.

           24       Q.  What case was that, sir?

           25       A.  I believe that was listed on page 10, about

                                                                       9



            1  five bullet points up from the bottom.  Garrison Realty,

            2  LP v. Fouse Architecture & Interiors, PC.

            3       Q.  That was the case in Marshall Division of the

            4  Eastern District of Texas?

            5       A.  Correct.

            6       Q.  And were there some statements or opinions in

            7  your report in that case that the Court determined you

            8  could not testify to at trial?

            9       A.  I just recall there being a discussion among

           10  the parties and the Court.  The Court took a recess to

           11  review my report and, you know, the Court, as -- as I

           12  would expect, says I couldn't render legal opinions,

           13  which I never attempted to do.  I was a damages expert in

           14  that case as I am in this one.

           15       Q.  Did the Court find that some of the things in

           16  your report counted as legal opinions?

           17       A.  I don't recall.

           18       Q.  Other than the three cases that you've just

           19  mentioned, are there any other cases where you were not

           20  permitted to testify to some or all of the substance of

           21  your expert reports?

           22                MR. MARKETOS:  Object- --

           23       A.  Not that I --

           24                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           25                Sorry.  You can answer.

                                                                      10



            1       A.  Not that I recall or that I'm aware of.  To be

            2  clear, it's not that I don't recall; not that -- not that

            3  I'm aware of.

            4       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  It's something you would

            5  recall?

            6       A.  I suspect I would or people like you would

            7  remind me of it.

            8       Q.  I assume you don't mean "people like you" in a

            9  derogatory way.

           10       A.  Of course not.  Esteemed members of the Bar, of

           11  course.

           12       Q.  How many times have you testified in a case

           13  about the sale of crude oil?

           14       A.  It depends on how broadly one defines that.

           15  I've had a number of oil and gas cases.  At some level,

           16  all of those involved the sale of crude oil.  I don't

           17  recall specifically sitting here -- and I've been doing

           18  this about 28 years and change, I believe -- I don't

           19  recall specifically having an oil trading case, if your

           20  point or your question is that narrow.

           21                But I've been involved in oil and gas

           22  partnership disputes, patent cases involving the oil and

           23  gas industry, a number of other oil and gas related

           24  cases.

           25       Q.  Let me try and be a little more specific, then.

                                                                      11



            1                Have you ever testified in trial where the

            2  damages were based on a contract to buy and sell crude

            3  oil?

            4       A.  Not as I recall sitting here today.

            5       Q.  Have you ever testified in a deposition in a

            6  case where the damages were based on a contract to buy

            7  and sell crude oil?

            8       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  Not that I recall.

            9       Q.  Best of your recollection, this is the first

           10  deposition you've given in a case involving a contract to

           11  buy and sell oil, true?

           12                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           13       A.  To the best of my recollection.

           14       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  How many times have you been

           15  hired by the Reese Marketos law firm?

           16       A.  I don't know.  I could look at my -- my bio and

           17  my testimony experience to see anything and point out

           18  cases --

           19       Q.  Okay.

           20       A.  -- if that would help you.

           21       Q.  Okay.  Well, let's start here:  Is this the

           22  first time you've been hired by the Reese Marketos law

           23  firm?

           24       A.  No.

           25       Q.  Are you currently an expert either consulting

                                                                      12



            1  or testifying in another case for the Reese Marketos law

            2  firm?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  How many other cases are you currently an

            5  expert either testifying or consulting for the Reese

            6  Marketos law firm?

            7       A.  One.

            8       Q.  Okay.  And what's the name of that case?

            9       A.  William Duncan, Jr., and Duncan Litigation

           10  Investments, LLC, v -- oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's

           11  completely wrong.  Please strike that.

           12                Dunster, D-u-n-s-t-e-r, Live, LLC, and

           13  Quorum Media Group, LLC v LoneStar Logos Management

           14  Company, LLC, et al.

           15       Q.  And looking at your testimony from 2005 to

           16  present, approximately how many of those cases represent

           17  engagements with the Reese Marketos law firm?

           18       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  Counting the one I just

           19  mentioned, two, I believe.

           20       Q.  And have you been hired as an expert, either

           21  consulting or testifying by the Reese Marketos law firm,

           22  in which you didn't give a deposition or testify at

           23  trial?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  And so those wouldn't appear here, right?

                                                                      13



            1       A.  Correct.

            2       Q.  Have you ever been hired by my law firm Susman

            3  Godfrey as either a testifying or consulting expert?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  Have you ever spoken to James Ballengee?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  How many times?

            8       A.  I believe three times.

            9       Q.  Do you recall when those conversations

           10  occurred?

           11       A.  I don't recall specific dates, but it would've

           12  been during my retention on this case.

           13       Q.  Okay.

           14       A.  And that's a pretty narrow range.

           15       Q.  Do you know when you were retained?

           16       A.  I believe it was toward the end of June of this

           17  year.

           18       Q.  Did you bring your retention agreement with you

           19  today?

           20       A.  Yes, and it just occurred to me I left it in

           21  the next room.  Happy to grab it now or on a break.

           22       Q.  I'm sure the date is in it and I assume we can

           23  deal with it later.  Thank you.

           24                And were the three times you spoke to

           25  Mr. Ballengee all tied to your expert reports in this

                                                                      14



            1  case?

            2       A.  It was tied to my preparation for the expert

            3  report, which I assume is what your question envisioned

            4  or entailed.

            5       Q.  And did you take notes during those

            6  conversations?

            7       A.  I had my report draft open as I was conversing

            8  with him and it incorporated the information that he

            9  provided me into the report.

           10       Q.  Right into the draft?  Sorry.

           11       A.  Into the draft, correct.

           12       Q.  Have you ever spoken to any other fact

           13  witnesses in this case?

           14       A.  To be fair, I don't -- I don't know who all of

           15  them are.  For example, conceivably a member of counsel

           16  could have a fact component, I guess.  I don't know.  So

           17  I don't know that it lists, but I'm -- to my knowledge,

           18  no.

           19       Q.  And let's put counsel aside --

           20       A.  Okay.

           21       Q.  -- for a moment.

           22                In investigating and creating your reports,

           23  did you seek out and talk to anyone who might have

           24  firsthand knowledge of the facts of this case other than

           25  attorneys?

                                                                      15



            1       A.  I've reviewed depositions, which I understand

            2  are different than interviews, but those people

            3  essentially have firsthand knowledge.  But I believe

            4  Mr. Ballengee is the only interview that I conducted.

            5       Q.  Just to make sure, you're not ascribing any

            6  special meaning to "interview" as opposed to a

            7  conversation, are you?

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  So no conversations, no interviews, nothing

           10  like that with --

           11       A.  No, no, no.

           12       Q.  -- any other witnesses?

           13                Have you corresponded by e-mail or phone or

           14  otherwise with any other expert, consulting or text -- or

           15  testifying, retained on behalf of the plaintiffs in this

           16  case?

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  Other than the draft report on your computer

           19  that you were working on, did you prepare any notes or

           20  outlines or timelines or -- related to this case?

           21       A.  No.

           22       Q.  In addition to your engagement letter, which I

           23  think is in the next room, did you bring with you a copy

           24  of your billing and payment records?

           25       A.  I brought a copy of the invoices.

                                                                      16



            1       Q.  And have you been paid yet in this case?

            2       A.  I can't answer that with 100 percent certainty.

            3  As memory serves, I believe the first invoice has been

            4  paid.

            5       Q.  Do you expect the others to be paid?

            6       A.  I do.  To be clear, at this point, there are

            7  only two.

            8       Q.  And you founded Echelon Analytics; is that

            9  right?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  And did I pronounce it correctly?

           12       A.  Sure, yeah.

           13       Q.  All right.  How many employees do you have?

           14       A.  Do you mean employees in the vernacular versus

           15  independent contractors versus equity members that get

           16  K-1s who -- you're not talking as the IRS defines

           17  employees, right?

           18       Q.  I'm not.  And let me ask it more broadly.

           19       A.  Okay.

           20       Q.  How many people work at Echelon Analytics?

           21       A.  Approximately 15.

           22       Q.  Did any of them assist you on this case?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And who did?

           25       A.  Ashley Gonzalez and Grant Juengling.

                                                                      17



            1       Q.  And did either Miss Gonzalez or Mr. Juengling

            2  prepare for you any summaries or outlines or drafts?

            3       A.  No.

            4       Q.  Did they share with you in writing any thoughts

            5  about this case?

            6       A.  No.

            7       Q.  Do you have an Employee Handbook or company

            8  rules or other personnel guidelines at your firm?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  And you expect your employees to follow those

           11  rules, true?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  And if your employees do not follow those

           14  rules, then they may face consequences up to and

           15  including termination; is that right?

           16                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Now, as I understand it, you

           19  were hired by Jamex Marketing, LLC, to provide opinions

           20  on damages in this case; is that right?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  And you're not a lawyer, true?

           23       A.  True.

           24       Q.  You're not offering any opinions on whether

           25  Jamex Marketing is liable to Whiting, are you?

                                                                      18



            1       A.  I am not.

            2       Q.  And you're not offering any opinions about

            3  whether or not Whiting is liable to Jamex Marketing,

            4  true?

            5       A.  True.

            6       Q.  And you've never worked in the oil and gas

            7  industry, true?

            8       A.  That is correct.

            9       Q.  And you're not an expert in the oil and gas

           10  industry, right?

           11       A.  Technical expert, I am not.  Clearly I have

           12  damages expertise in the oil and gas industry.

           13       Q.  Well, let's put aside your damages expertise.

           14                You're not here to opine on the customs and

           15  practices in the oil and gas industry, true?

           16       A.  Not specifically, no.

           17       Q.  And you're not an expert in the customs and

           18  practices in the oil and gas industry, right?

           19       A.  I think given my work in the oil and gas

           20  industry, I know more than the average person on the

           21  street about those because I've reviewed license

           22  agreements, contracts in a number of contexts, as I've

           23  mentioned.  I've -- I've done damages-related work in

           24  partnership disputes involving oil and gas, so I'm

           25  familiar with lots of those kinds of things, but I am not

                                                                      19



            1  a contract expert in -- in oil and gas in those -- and

            2  I'm not an industry expert, per se.

            3       Q.  Okay.  You're not an industry expert in the oil

            4  and gas industry, right?  I mean, I've -- I've read your

            5  bio.  You don't hold yourself out to be an expert in the

            6  oil and gas industry, true?

            7       A.  Except in the context --

            8                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection -- sorry.

            9                THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.

           10                MR. MARKETOS:  Go ahead, sir.

           11                THE COURT REPORTER:  All right.  Are you

           12  objecting?

           13                MR. MARKETOS:  I did.

           14                Objection; form.

           15                THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.  I need to hear

           16  you.  Go ahead.

           17       A.  Except in the manner that I have indicated,

           18  which is the more narrow way of I have a business

           19  perspective.  I -- I have more expertise than the average

           20  person, but because of my work in the damages area in --

           21  in oil and gas.  But I am not an industry expert as I

           22  understand you to use that term in your question.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Have you ever been hired as an

           24  industry expert in the oil and gas industry?

           25       A.  No.

                                                                      20



            1       Q.  Have you ever offered any testimony as an

            2  expert in the oil and gas industry?  And I mean that

            3  separate from damages accruing to participants in the oil

            4  and gas industry.

            5       A.  I have not.

            6       Q.  And as I understand it, you're not offering any

            7  opinions on matters such as the validity of any contract

            8  at issue in this matter or any other liability-related

            9  issues, true?

           10       A.  That is true.

           11       Q.  And likewise, you're not offering any opinions

           12  about how to interpret the contract between Jamex

           13  Marketing and Shell, right?

           14       A.  That sounds like a -- a legal question, so, no,

           15  I am not offering contract interpretation opinions.

           16       Q.  And similarly, you're not offering contract

           17  interpretations about any of the contracts at issue in

           18  this case, true?

           19       A.  In a legal sense, no.

           20       Q.  Are -- are you offering interpretations of the

           21  contracts in this case?

           22       A.  Well, from a business perspective, but not in a

           23  legal context at all.

           24       Q.  What do you mean "from a business perspective"?

           25       A.  Well, both Mr. Fuller and I, I think, made

                                                                      21



            1  some -- read, for example, the termination clause, which

            2  I suspect you and I will spend some time on today, and we

            3  see that from a business perspective, but I'm not

            4  rendering a legal opinion on what's binding, what's not

            5  binding, what meets the qualifications, and what actions

            6  or events occurred that provide Shell an ability to

            7  exercise that termination clause.  I am not opining on

            8  any legal aspect of that.

            9                I can read it as a business person and have

           10  a sense of it as a business person, but I am not offering

           11  a legal opinion on an interpretation of any -- of that

           12  provision or any other provision of that contract or any

           13  other contract at issue in this case.

           14       Q.  All right.  Do you believe that your report

           15  offers an opinion on -- I think you're talking about

           16  Section 3.3, from a business perspective?

           17       A.  In a sense because I have to evaluate risk

           18  associated with that contract.  So I have to interpret

           19  it -- interpret that contract and other factors at -- at

           20  issue in play to determine and assess a level of risk.

           21                So, yes, from that perspective, I do have

           22  to have a sense of this contract, a sense of what the

           23  parties were obligated to do, and a sense of the

           24  probability of that occurring and to put that in proper

           25  context and compare that to risk and the industry in

                                                                      22



            1  which these players played.

            2       Q.  And you have a copy of your report in front of

            3  you, true?

            4       A.  My first report, yes.

            5       Q.  Can you show me where in that report you offer

            6  an opinion from a business perspective about Section 3.3?

            7                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            8       A.  Well, I --

            9                MR. CARLIS:  What's the basis of the

           10  objection?

           11                MR. MARKETOS:  Assumes facts not in

           12  evidence and it mischaracterizes his testimony.

           13       A.  I just said to come to my assessment of what an

           14  appropriate discount rate was, which is discussed in --

           15  in my report, I have to evaluate the potential of this

           16  contract not running seven years or something happening.

           17  So I have to look at the contract.  I have to assess the

           18  contract from a business perspective.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And can you show me where in

           20  your report you assess the contract from a business

           21  perspective?

           22       A.  I don't know that I specifically went into a

           23  labored analysis of any particular thing.  I believe I

           24  discuss a termination in my rebuttal report that was

           25  issued on August 23.  I addressed Mr. Fuller's critique

                                                                      23



            1  of my -- my work in which he talked about the termination

            2  clause and I know I discussed the termination clause in

            3  that report.  I don't recall whether I -- I specifically

            4  talked about the termination clause in the first report

            5  or not.

            6                (Deposition Exhibit 238 marked for

            7                 identification.)

            8       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Well, let me hand you a copy

            9  of your August 23 rebuttal report, which I've marked for

           10  identification as 238.

           11       A.  I do recall one thing, before we get to that

           12  report, staying with my first report.  If we go to

           13  Schedule 3, page 2, Footnote 5, "This premium considers

           14  the risk associated with the potential lawful termination

           15  of the Shell -- Jamex/Shell Agreement, the potential

           16  termination of the Whiting/Shell Agreement and all other

           17  risk factors related to industry issues over the

           18  seven-year term of the Shell -- of the Jamex/Shell

           19  Agreement."

           20                So that's one example.

           21       Q.  And as you sit here today, what was the risk of

           22  termination of the Whiting/Shell Agreement?

           23       A.  I'm sorry.  What -- can you be more specific?

           24  I don't understand that question.

           25       Q.  Yeah.  So you say that your risk premium

                                                                      24



            1  considers the risk associated with the potential lawful

            2  termination of the Whiting/Shell Agreement, right?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  And my question for you is:  What -- what is

            5  the risk?  What was the risk of the potential termination

            6  of the Whiting/Shell Agreement?

            7       A.  Are you asking for a probability calculation?

            8  Are you asking for a subjective discussion of that risk?

            9  I don't understand what you're asking.

           10       Q.  Well, I'm trying to understand your statement,

           11  sir.

           12                So what I want to know is what was the risk

           13  associated with the potential termination of the

           14  Whiting/Shell Agreement?

           15       A.  Well, the -- the risk of the Whiting/Shell

           16  Agreement is that whatever event, one party or the other

           17  reached that agreement or terminated the agreement.  I

           18  don't remember the termination provisions of that

           19  agreement and what those were.  But any contract that has

           20  ever existed had some risk of not being fulfilled into

           21  the express termination date of that contract.

           22                And so I didn't look at that and assign a

           23  calculation or a probability to it, but I looked at that

           24  and said what are the conditions on which -- I wasn't

           25  specifically looking at Whiting/Shell as much as I was

                                                                      25



            1  looking at Jamex/Shell, but looking at that and trying to

            2  determine if that was any more risky than any typical

            3  contract was in this particular industry.

            4       Q.  What are the conditions on which the

            5  Whiting/Shell Agreement could be terminated?

            6                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            7       A.  I would have to look back at that agreement to

            8  determine.  I don't know sitting here today.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Do you know if the termination

           10  risk of the Whiting/Shell Agreement was greater or lesser

           11  than the termination risk of the Jamex/Shell Agreement?

           12       A.  Again, sitting here today, I don't know because

           13  I -- I just -- just said I don't remember what it was

           14  sitting here.

           15       Q.  How did those risks -- how were -- how was the

           16  risk of the termination of the Whiting/Shell Agreement

           17  incorporated into your risk review?

           18       A.  Through the industry risk factor.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Did you conclude that the termination of

           20  the Whiting/Shell Agreement was more or less likely than

           21  your standard agreement in the industry?

           22       A.  I determined it was no more likely.

           23       Q.  No more likely.  Okay.

           24                And what about the Jamex/Shell Agreement?

           25  Did you determine that that was more or less likely to be

                                                                      26



            1  terminated than your average agreement in the oil and gas

            2  industry?

            3       A.  I didn't look at any one factor to the

            4  exclusion of all others and -- in -- in identifying

            5  potentially thousands of factors and assign an individual

            6  probability.

            7                I looked at the wholistic scenario before

            8  me and -- and looked for anomalies or bright line things

            9  that would stand out to say, "This requires an

           10  adjustment.  This seems really different than what one

           11  would expect in this -- in this particular industry

           12  that -- and this justifies either a significantly lower

           13  risk premium for the industry than the industry or a

           14  significantly higher one."  That was the assessment.

           15       Q.  A moment ago you told me, though, that you

           16  believed that the potential termination of the

           17  Whiting/Shell Agreement was, quote, no more likely than

           18  other agreements in the industry, true?

           19       A.  Generally speaking, that's correct.

           20       Q.  And what about the Jamex/Shell Agreement?  Did

           21  you believe that termination of that agreement was no

           22  more likely than your average agreement in the oil and

           23  gas industry?

           24       A.  No, I didn't find it any -- any more -- more

           25  risky, no.

                                                                      27



            1       Q.  So you thought the risk of termination of the

            2  Jamex/Shell Agreement was comparable to the risk of

            3  termination of the Whiting/Shell Agreement, true?

            4       A.  In a general sense, that's right.

            5       Q.  Okay.  And -- and that's because you reviewed

            6  the termination provisions, true?

            7       A.  I did.

            8       Q.  And you considered the likelihood of

            9  termination given those provisions, true?

           10       A.  Among many other factors, yes.

           11       Q.  And -- and you determined based on those

           12  provisions and other factors that the risk of termination

           13  was similar between those two agreements, true?

           14       A.  You're obviously harping on one condition.

           15  There are many factors to consider.  I considered them

           16  wholistically and came to the risk profile that I came

           17  to, the calculation I came to to determine the

           18  appropriate discount rate for the cash flows that I was

           19  discounting.

           20                So it's not a series of pinpoint decisions.

           21  It's a -- an overall analysis that one considers all

           22  relevant factors and makes appropriate judgments.

           23       Q.  Take a look at Footnote 5 again, sir, or

           24  Note 5.  This is page 2 of your initial report.

           25       A.  Okay.

                                                                      28



            1       Q.  This note talks only about the risk associated

            2  with potential lawful termination, true?

            3       A.  It does not.

            4       Q.  This -- I'm gonna read it aloud and tell me if

            5  I've read it correctly.  "This premium considers the risk

            6  associated with the potential lawful termination of the

            7  Jamex/Shell Agreement, potential termination of the

            8  Whiting/Shell Agreement, and all other risk factors

            9  related to industry issues over the" -- oh, you're

           10  correct.  I misread that last part.

           11                You decided that the risk associated with

           12  the potential lawful termination of the Jamex/Shell

           13  Agreement -- strike that.

           14                What are the other risk factors related to

           15  industry issues over the seven-year term of the

           16  Jamex/Shell Agreement?

           17       A.  There are any number of risk factors that go

           18  into whether a contract's going to play out as intended

           19  by the parties.  It's -- and part of it goes to overall

           20  economy.  Part of it goes to prices of oil and gas.

           21  That's effectively not in this particular contract

           22  because of the way it was structured, but it certainly

           23  impacted the comparable companies I used in my benchmark.

           24                So the overall political, geopolitical

           25  disruption.  Any -- any number of factors that can

                                                                      29



            1  compact contracts or business activities in the oil and

            2  gas industry.

            3       Q.  And you -- which other factors did you

            4  consider?

            5                So we've got the economy, oil and gas

            6  prices, geopolitical disruption.

            7                What else?

            8       A.  By considering benchmark companies in the oil

            9  and gas industry, I implicitly, if not explicitly

           10  considered every risk factor that impacts an oil and gas

           11  company operating in this space in the specific SIC code

           12  that I determined to be appropriate for this particular

           13  entity.

           14       Q.  Which SIC code did you use?

           15       A.  If memory serves, it's 5172.  We could

           16  search -- we could confirm that.

           17                (Examined exhibit.)  Yes, 5172.

           18       Q.  So I think before we got distracted, we were

           19  looking for opinions on -- from a business perspective

           20  on -- that you're offering about Section 3.3.  We found

           21  this Note 5, which was on page 2.

           22                Are there others in this report?

           23       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  So on page 8 of my

           24  August 23 report, paragraph 23 --

           25       Q.  I'm sorry, you've moved to Exhibit 238?

                                                                      30



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  My question's still on --

            3       A.  Oh, I'm sorry.

            4       Q.  -- your first one, Exhibit 236.

            5       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  I'm trying to scan this

            6  quickly for the second time, but I don't see a specific

            7  discussion in the narrative portion of my July 12 report

            8  about the termination clause specifically, but clearly my

            9  schedule's -- including Schedule 3 that we were just

           10  discussing is where I dealt with risk, and that's the

           11  most relevant place for me to deal with that potential

           12  for termination.

           13       Q.  Well, other than Note 5 that we've already

           14  discussed, where else is it discussed in your schedules?

           15       A.  Except for the one place that I should have

           16  discussed it, I'm not sure if I discussed it somewhere

           17  else or not.  Sitting here today, I don't see that I did,

           18  but I don't know why I would.

           19       Q.  Okay.  And I'm not trying to play any games

           20  with you.  This is my one chance before trial.  I don't

           21  want you to show up there and suggest that other words in

           22  your report are interpreting 3.3, and so I want you to

           23  be -- I want you to be sure.

           24                MR. MARKETOS:  Seriously, do you want him

           25  to read his -- read the whole thing?

                                                                      31



            1                MR. CARLIS:  If he would like to.  I mean,

            2  I assume he's here for -- pretty familiar with it.

            3                MR. MARKETOS:  I assume that, too,

            4  but . . .

            5       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  In this report, I believe

            6  that's the only place that I discuss the termination

            7  clause.

            8                (Deposition Exhibit 237 marked for

            9                 identification.)

           10       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And here's 237, which I think

           11  is your second report in this case.

           12                And the same -- the same question.  I just

           13  want to know where you -- in that report, if anywhere,

           14  you're offering opinions about the termination provision

           15  in 3.3.

           16       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  This is my response to

           17  Mr. Fuller's affirmative report.  I don't believe the

           18  termination clause is discussed in here, after my scan of

           19  it.

           20       Q.  And then I cut you off earlier after you had

           21  already found one, but let's turn --

           22       A.  I saved my spot.

           23       Q.  Great.  Thank you.

           24                Let's turn to Exhibit 238.  Tell me all the

           25  places here where you're offering opinions about

                                                                      32



            1  Section 3.3.

            2       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  I think the first mention

            3  is in paragraph 21, top of the page 8 -- or near the top

            4  of page 8, and picking up mid-sentence, third line toward

            5  the right, "I did review Jamex financial statements,

            6  interviewed Mr. Ballengee, reviewed the Jamex/Shell

            7  Agreement, including the termination clause," and -- and

            8  go on to finish that sentence.  So that's one comment

            9  related to the termination clause.

           10       Q.  Other than paragraph 21, do you offer any other

           11  opinions about the termination clause?

           12       A.  In paragraph 23, I can contest Mr. Fuller's

           13  assertion that the termination clause demonstrates, in

           14  his words, "significant risk of termination."

           15                And then where he also goes on to say that

           16  Shell's ability to terminate the Shell/Jamex confirmation

           17  with 30-day written notice was a -- a key reason for

           18  his -- that my discount rate was too low.  And, I mean,

           19  that entire paragraph is related to his take on the

           20  termination clause.

           21       Q.  Okay.  Paragraph 21 and paragraph 23.

           22                Are there any other paragraphs?

           23       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  I mean, this -- this

           24  entire section, to some extent, speaks to that.

           25                24 talks about the potential of a

                                                                      33



            1  terminated Jamex/Shell agreement.  This whole issue of

            2  whether or not I should have included a company-specific

            3  risk component in my discount rate, Mr. Fuller cites the

            4  termination clause as being a -- a reason I should have

            5  and -- and I contest that here.

            6       Q.  And that -- that's because you think that the

            7  termination provision in the Jamex/Shell Agreement is no

            8  more likely to be invoked than the termination provision

            9  in other typical agreements in the oil and gas industry;

           10  is that right?

           11                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           12       A.  I agreed with you earlier on that, but bottom

           13  line is it's just not that simple.  I looked at it

           14  wholistically.  And I know you want to parse it out so

           15  you have your -- your sound bite to -- to argue

           16  differently, but it's not that simple.

           17                A discount rate calculation -- a discount

           18  rate determination -- it's more a determination than a

           19  calculation.  There's a calculation that gets down to

           20  math at some point, but this is not something that you

           21  can calculate scientifically to two decimal places.

           22                It's something that one has to take into

           23  account all relevant factors, and then once you've taken

           24  into account all relevant factors, assess them in an

           25  intellectually honest way.

                                                                      34



            1                Then using business judgment and

            2  experience, determine what the appropriate rate is, and

            3  that's the analysis I performed.  Putting this particular

            4  contract -- this particular clause of this contract into

            5  the overall rubric of risk of this contract not being

            6  fulfilled, of Jamex not getting its buck 40 per barrel

            7  over the seven-year period with contracts that these

            8  benchmark companies would enter into, and that's the

            9  analysis I performed, no less or no more.

           10                MR. CARLIS:  I'm going to object to that as

           11  nonresponsive.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Let's start at paragraph 21.

           13                You say that you reviewed the Jamex/Shell

           14  Agreement including the termination clause, true?

           15       A.  I did.

           16       Q.  And nowhere in 21 do you offer an

           17  interpretation of the meaning of the termination clause,

           18  right?

           19       A.  I do not.

           20       Q.  And nowhere in your report -- in this report or

           21  in either of your other reports do you offer an

           22  interpretation of the termination clause, true?

           23       A.  From a legal perspective, absolutely not.

           24       Q.  You're not here to tell the Court or tell the

           25  jury what the termination provision means, right?

                                                                      35



            1       A.  I am not.

            2       Q.  In paragraph 23 you reference Mr. Fuller's

            3  opinion and suggest that he states that there's

            4  significant risk of termination of the Jamex/Shell

            5  Agreement, true?

            6       A.  I don't think I suggest it.  I think he did say

            7  it and I say that he said it, so just to be clear.

            8       Q.  Paragraph 23 you say that Mr. Fuller said that

            9  there was significant risk of the Jamex/Shell Agreement

           10  being terminated, right?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  And you don't believe that that's true; is that

           13  right?

           14       A.  I believe his -- he's -- he's interpreting

           15  the -- or attempting to interpret the termination clause

           16  to a greater extent than I've attempted to to -- as a

           17  matter of -- to start things.

           18                And then second, I believe he's attempting

           19  to overstate the ease at which Shell could terminate it.

           20       Q.  So I think you said two things.  I want to make

           21  sure I understand the first.

           22                You believe that Mr. Fuller has offered

           23  more of an interpretation of Section 3.3 than you're

           24  offering in this case; is that right?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                      36



            1       A.  That's my take on it.  That's my inference from

            2  what I read in his report.

            3       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Okay.  And -- and you state,

            4  the end of Section 23, "I understand that the

            5  circumstances under which Shell could terminate the

            6  agreement were limited based on the express language of

            7  the agreement," true?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  And you say "I understand."

           10                Did someone tell you that?

           11       A.  I would say I have at least two bases for that

           12  statement.  I -- I'm sure that counsel for Jamex

           13  expressed that view.

           14                And then second, again, I read that

           15  provision as a -- as a business person, and I've also

           16  seen deposition testimony that -- where this clause was

           17  parsed considerably.

           18                And I also understand that this language

           19  was not the first attempt at a termination clause and

           20  that the first attempt by Shell at a termination clause

           21  was much more broad, gave Shell much greater opportunity

           22  to get out of this contract, and effectively attempted to

           23  turn a seven-year deal into a month-to-month deal.

           24                And I don't believe it requires a law

           25  degree to say that this termination clause is less

                                                                      37



            1  flexible for Shell than the earlier draft of one.  So

            2  that -- I think it's both those things.

            3       Q.  Whose deposition testimony are you referring to

            4  having reviewed about Section 3.3?

            5       A.  At least Mr. Ballengee and Mr. Jilla.

            6       Q.  Anyone else?

            7       A.  Those are the two that come to mind.

            8       Q.  Well, feel free to take a look at your report

            9  and see if you cite others.

           10       A.  Well, I cite others, but those are the two that

           11  I recall discussing that issue.

           12       Q.  Do you have any reason to doubt Mr. Ballengee's

           13  interpretation of Section 3.3?

           14                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           15       A.  I -- I didn't really look at it that way.  I

           16  was interested in the back and forth and -- and the

           17  discussion and in the reference to previ- -- previous

           18  drafts.

           19                I didn't read it to form an opinion, again,

           20  because I -- a strict legal interpretation of that

           21  contract or that clause of that contract is not my

           22  purview.  I was reading the deposition for general

           23  background information in the case.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  I think you said a moment ago

           25  that Section 3.3 was more broad than the original

                                                                      38



            1  proposal from Shell.

            2                Is that your testimony?

            3                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            4       A.  That was my business person interpretation,

            5  yes.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And you understand that

            7  Mr. Ballengee and Jamex proposed their own termination

            8  provision, true?

            9       A.  I believe -- I don't know that to be true.  I

           10  recall that they would prefer not to have one.  I recall

           11  that.  I don't know that they proposed alternative

           12  verbiage.  They may have.  I don't recall one way or the

           13  other.

           14       Q.  You understand that the termination provision

           15  of Section 3.3 is more broad than what Jamex and

           16  Mr. Ballengee wanted to have in the agreement, right?

           17                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           18       A.  I think I understand what you mean by "more

           19  broad," but can you --

           20       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Sure.  Understanding that the

           21  termination section in Section 3.3 covers more things

           22  than would justify termination than the termination

           23  provision that Mr. Ballengee or Mr. Jilla and Jamex

           24  wanted to have in the agreement, right?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                      39



            1       A.  I believe that's --  I believe I agree with

            2  that.

            3       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  What are some of the reasons

            4  why Shell could terminate the Shell/Jamex Agreement?

            5                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            6       A.  That clause clearly speaks for itself.  I'd

            7  prefer to -- you look at that.  I, again, viewed that

            8  primarily as a legal issue, and we've discussed I'm not

            9  an attorney and that is really outside my scope other

           10  than the narrow issue of determining risk.

           11       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  As you sit here today, can you

           12  identify any bases for which Shell could terminate the

           13  Shell/Jamex Agreement?

           14                MR. MARKETOS:  Same basis.  Same -- same

           15  objection.

           16       A.  I think my prior answer sticks, but I recall

           17  that one of them being if another party outside the

           18  parties involved and -- and specifically identified in

           19  the contract come forward and contend that they have a

           20  right to the $1.40 shipper fee, that could be a potential

           21  cause -- or a reason for termination.

           22       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You said the provision speaks

           23  for itself.

           24                Do you believe 3.3 says that it has to be a

           25  party not involved in the Shell/Jamex Agreement?

                                                                      40



            1                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            2       A.  Again, I think that's a legal interpretation.

            3  That's beyond my purview, and I -- if you're here to find

            4  out what I'm not going to say at trial, you just found

            5  out something I'm not going to say at trial.

            6                That's -- I'm not going to weigh in on a

            7  legal interpretation of who could assert rights that

            8  would allow Shell to get out of that contract.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You're not gonna come to trial

           10  and testify to when Shell could or couldn't terminate its

           11  agreement with Jamex, true?

           12       A.  True.

           13                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           14                THE WITNESS:  Sorry, I did it again.

           15                THE COURT REPORTER:  What was your answer?

           16                THE WITNESS:  Sure.

           17                THE COURT REPORTER:  Did you say "sure" or

           18  "true"?  Okay.

           19                THE WITNESS:  I'll go with either one of

           20  those.

           21                THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.  Thanks.

           22                MR. CARLIS:  Pardon me.  I got a little

           23  tangled.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Mr. Bell, you understand that

           25  it's the jury's job, not your job, to resolve disputed

                                                                      41



            1  factual issues, right?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  And you're not gonna come to trial and try and

            4  resolve disputed factual issues for the jury, true?

            5                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            6       A.  I am not.

            7       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And there are times -- and I'm

            8  sure you know that there are facts in dispute in this

            9  case, right?

           10       A.  I assume there are in most cases that make it

           11  to trial.

           12       Q.  I assume so.

           13                And rather than resolving disputed factual

           14  issues, Jamex's lawyers have instructed you to make

           15  certain assumptions, true?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  And so, for example, Jamex's lawyers have asked

           18  you to assume that Whiting tortiously interfered with the

           19  Jamex/Shell Agreement, right?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And in reaching your opinions on damages,

           22  you've assumed that Whiting was liable, true?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And did the lawyers for Jamex Marketing ask you

           25  to make any other assumptions?

                                                                      42



            1       A.  Not that I recall.  And I've attempted to

            2  disclose any of those fundamental foundational

            3  assumptions in my reports.

            4       Q.  So your reports, I've read them.  They identify

            5  the assumption I just said.

            6                But if the reports don't identify an

            7  assumption, then you're not making it; is that true?

            8                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection.

            9       A.  To the best of my knowledge, no.

           10       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  So in your first two

           11  reports -- I think you still have them in front of you --

           12  you have a heading titled "The Disputes" sort of early in

           13  the report.

           14                And you're familiar with that header?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  Now, can you explain the purpose of that

           17  section of your reports?

           18       A.  Sure.  That -- that's part of my standard

           19  report template where pretty much any report that I do in

           20  a litigation matter, I'm going to have a description

           21  of -- I'm gonna start the report with a -- an

           22  introduction of myself and my experience and credentials

           23  that form the basis of my ability to weigh into this and

           24  assist the trier in fact to determine damages.

           25                I'm then going to have an identification at

                                                                      43



            1  a very high level of the parties involved, and then my

            2  understanding of what the parties are fighting over.

            3                So it's intended to be a background that

            4  lays out the facts as I understand them or the dispute --

            5  the disputed facts as has been claimed, what the

            6  allegations are, because as we just discussed, my

            7  directive is to assume that the allegations are true,

            8  that liability will be found.  And in that context

            9  between these parties in this industry, in this context,

           10  I've analyzed damages.

           11       Q.  So one of the things you cite in the "The

           12  Dispute" section of your report are Jamex's complaints

           13  and amended complaint in this case, right?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And -- and I think you said a moment ago you

           16  cite that because you're assuming that the allegations in

           17  those are true and they therefore can be cited in your

           18  "The Dispute" section; is that right?

           19       A.  Correct.

           20       Q.  And did your understanding of the dispute

           21  change between your first report on July 12th and your

           22  second report on August 9th?

           23       A.  Well, we're talking about two different cases

           24  effectively, right, because we're talking about my second

           25  report dealt with the counterclaim.  So it's a different

                                                                      44



            1  dispute in that sense because now it's Whiting in the

            2  plaintiff's chair suing Jamex and Mr. Ballengee.

            3                So from that perspective, it's a different

            4  dispute.  They're clearly related, but it's a different

            5  dispute.

            6       Q.  Were there things in your July 12th report that

            7  you decided were wrong and changed in your August 9th

            8  report?

            9       A.  Not to my knowledge.

           10       Q.  Okay.

           11       A.  If you'd like to compare, I'm happy to discuss

           12  it with you.

           13       Q.  And -- and do you have any personal opinions as

           14  an expert in this case on whether the factual assertions

           15  you make in the "The Dispute" section of your report are,

           16  in fact, true?

           17       A.  No, I believe -- I mean, we could go through.

           18  Some of those are cited to a -- a pleading by either

           19  Whiting or Jamex, and so those are one -- that party's

           20  view of the facts.

           21                All other case -- other parts of the

           22  dispute, I think, are undisputed.  For example -- or I

           23  believe to be absolute fact.

           24                For example, I'm sure I said in those

           25  sections that on such and such date this party filed an

                                                                      45



            1  amended petition or this party filed its -- its initial

            2  petition or something like that, and in -- and in that

            3  particular case, I believe that to be fact because I have

            4  a -- that filing stamped by the Court with that

            5  particular date.  So that's, in my view, a supported

            6  fact.

            7                But with -- I'm happy to delve deeper if

            8  you have issues that you want to explore.

            9                And for the record, this is the most

           10  interested any attorney has ever been in my dispute

           11  section of my background report.

           12       Q.  I liked it.

           13       A.  Yeah.

           14       Q.  So in the -- go ahead and turn to paragraph 12

           15  of your first report.  Page 4, if that's helpful.

           16       A.  It is.  Thank you.

           17                (Examined exhibit.)  Okay.

           18       Q.  You say here that -- effectively Whiting agreed

           19  to sell Bridger Marketing 15,000 barrels of oil per day

           20  at WTI minus 780, right?  Fair characterization?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Who -- who told you that in late 2014 or early

           23  2015 Whiting agreed to sell Bridger 15,000 barrels of oil

           24  per day at WTI minus 780?

           25       A.  You see the footnote there, Footnote 14.  No

                                                                      46



            1  one told me that.  I cite two sources there:  The

            2  plaintiff's amended petition and Mr. Ballengee's

            3  deposition.

            4       Q.  And do you know any of the other terms of that

            5  purported agreement?

            6       A.  I may have seen documents that relate to that.

            7  Sitting here today, I don't recall.

            8       Q.  Do you know what Bridger Marketing was going to

            9  do with the oil it apparently planned to buy from

           10  Whiting?

           11                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           12       A.  I haven't had a specific discussion, but

           13  understanding their business, I am pretty sure they

           14  intended to sell it to someone.

           15       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Sell it at a better price,

           16  make money off the transaction?

           17       A.  I -- I'm sure that was their goal.

           18                MR. MARKETOS:  Same objection.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You state that Jamex asked

           20  Shell to act as a sleeve for that purported agreement.

           21                Do you know who told you that?

           22       A.  That may have come up in a discussion with

           23  Mr. Ballengee.  I don't specifically recall, but that

           24  would potentially be one source of it.

           25                I've also seen that discussed -- it was

                                                                      47



            1  clearly in -- in the petition, which I believe I've cited

            2  in this -- well, I've certainly cited in this section.

            3                And I -- I think I recall seeing other

            4  contemporaneous documents that discussed a potential

            5  sleeve.

            6       Q.  Do you know what it means to act as a sleeve in

            7  this context?

            8       A.  I mean, in the broadest of terms, yes.  I mean,

            9  it's essentially providing credit backing or backing for

           10  the purposes of credit for a transaction -- oil and gas

           11  transaction.

           12       Q.  And you said "in the -- the broadest of terms."

           13                What in this -- what about in this specific

           14  context?  Do you know what it meant for Shell to be

           15  acting as a sleeve?

           16       A.  It -- it's what I said.  When I said "in

           17  broadest terms," I wasn't going to give you the

           18  Merriam-Webster verbatim definition of sleeve, but that's

           19  my general understanding of what that means --

           20       Q.  Okay.  And --

           21       A.  -- in this context and generally.

           22       Q.  And the idea would be for Jamex to use Shell's

           23  better credit to make the transaction occur; is that

           24  right?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                      48



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Is it your understanding that

            3  Shell ultimately acted as sleeve for the -- in the

            4  contracts that were signed in 2017?

            5       A.  It's my understanding that it did not.

            6                MR. CARLIS:  We've been now going for an

            7  hour, a little bit slower than I had expected.  I'm

            8  inclined to take a short break if that's okay with

            9  you-all.  I'm actually planning for it to be short.

           10                MR. MARKETOS:  Sure.  Perfect.

           11                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off record at 10:39 a.m.

           12                (A recess was taken from 10:39 a.m. to

           13                 10:52 a.m.)

           14                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on record at

           15  10:52 a.m.

           16       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Mr. Bell, I know earlier I

           17  asked if you had your retention agreement, et cetera.

           18  Thank you for giving it to me at the break.  I have it.

           19  I appreciate it.

           20       A.  Thank you -- or you're welcome, I guess, more

           21  appropriately.

           22       Q.  I want to make sure that I understand how you

           23  calculated damages in this case.

           24                Is it fair to say that you calculated what

           25  you considered to be the net present value of Jamex's

                                                                      49



            1  lost profits under the terminated Jamex/Shell Agreement?

            2       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  Is it fair to say that you use a sort of

            4  but-for analysis to try to determine the profits Jamex

            5  would have made but for Shell's termination of that

            6  agreement?

            7       A.  Yes.

            8       Q.  And is it fair to say that your analysis

            9  includes four key variables?  I know there are probably

           10  others, but four key ones:

           11                The -- the number of barrels of oil;

           12                the profits Jamex would earn on each

           13  barrel;

           14                when those profits would be earned;

           15                and a discount rate.

           16       A.  Yes, those are all important factors.

           17       Q.  Are there any others that you would consider

           18  key that I'm -- that I'm missing?

           19       A.  Well, clearly the term.  I guess that goes

           20  without -- without saying.

           21                But the -- the time period over which those

           22  future damages would have been earned or the lost -- the

           23  profits would have been earned is one that comes to mind

           24  that I don't think you specifically mentioned.

           25       Q.  I meant it hidden inside when those profits

                                                                      50



            1  would be earned.

            2       A.  Oh, I'm sorry.

            3       Q.  But I'm with you on the -- on the temporal

            4  pieces.

            5       A.  So that -- I mean, I think those -- those are

            6  the highest level factors, yes.

            7       Q.  So the number of barrels of oil, the profits

            8  Jamex would earn on each barrel, when those profits would

            9  be earned or the term of the agreement, and a discount

           10  rate.

           11                Were you instructed to assume the value for

           12  any of those variables?

           13       A.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I was listening closely, but

           14  let's just take them one at a time, if you would --

           15       Q.  Sure.

           16       A.  -- just so everything is really clear.

           17       Q.  The number of barrels of oil, let's use a per

           18  day as our metric.

           19                Were -- were you instructed to assume the

           20  number of barrels of oil that Jamex would purchase under

           21  the Jamex/Shell Agreement?

           22       A.  No, I believe I got that from the agreement

           23  itself.

           24       Q.  Okay.  And what about the profits Jamex would

           25  earn on each barrel?  Were you instructed to assume

                                                                      51



            1  profits or did you determine that yourself?

            2       A.  I determined that myself.

            3       Q.  And the third, when those profits would be

            4  earned, is that something you determined yourself or were

            5  you instructed to assume?

            6       A.  I made my own assessment of that.

            7       Q.  And on the discount rate, you made your own

            8  assessment of that too --

            9       A.  I --

           10       Q.  -- true?

           11       A.  I did.

           12       Q.  So each of those key variables, you made your

           13  own independent assessment, true?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  All right.  So let's start, then, with the

           16  number of barrels of oil.

           17                You state in your report that under the

           18  Jamex/Shell Agreement, Jamex was to purchase up to 15,000

           19  barrels of crude oil per day from Shell at Robinson Lake,

           20  North Dakota, true?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  And do you stand by that statement?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And are these the same barrels that you used to

           25  calculate the lost profits in this case?

                                                                      52



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  And as far as you know, these are the only

            3  barrels of oil at issue in the case, right?

            4       A.  Directly at issue, yeah.  I mean, there are

            5  other agreements that the various parties were involved

            6  with and I've seen references to Jamex and its -- by

            7  its -- by its other names has a long history of buying

            8  oil from Whiting.

            9                But directly related to this case, that

           10  15,000 barrels per day is -- is what is germane.

           11       Q.  Let me ask it slightly different so I'm sure

           12  we're talking about the same thing.

           13                As far as you know, the 15,000 barrels of

           14  crude oil per day that Whiting was to purchase from Shell

           15  at Robinson Lake are the only barrels of oil contributing

           16  to your damages calculation; is that right?

           17       A.  Yes, it is.

           18       Q.  And you say that you determined that -- that

           19  number of barrels on your own.

           20                And fair to say you did that based on

           21  reviewing the master crude purchase and sale agreement

           22  confirmation between Shell and Jamex?

           23       A.  That was one source, yes.

           24       Q.  Okay.  And can we call that the Jamex/Shell

           25  Agreement?

                                                                      53



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  Okay.  I'm handing you Exhibit --

            3                THE COURT REPORTER:  What is it?  239?

            4                MR. CARLIS:  This is Exhibit 2 that was

            5  previously marked.

            6                THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.

            7                (Deposition Exhibit 2 referenced.)

            8       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  So I've handed you the

            9  Jamex/Shell Agreement.

           10                Can you tell me where in this agreement it

           11  entitles Jamex to purchase up to 15,000 barrels of crude

           12  oil at Robinson Lake?

           13       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  That sounds like a

           14  legal -- or -- or request for a legal opinion.  You said

           15  what entitles it to -- to buy, so maybe I'm missing the

           16  import of your question, but . . .

           17       Q.  You determined that under the Jamex/Shell

           18  Agreement, Jamex was entitled to purchase up to 15,000

           19  barrels a day at Robinson Lake, true?

           20                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           21       A.  I mean, part of that goes to liability

           22  assumption, I believe.  But generally, yes.

           23                (Examined exhibit.)  And specifically, if

           24  we're looking at what you've handed to me as Exhibit 2,

           25  if we look at page 3 of that, 4.1.1 identifies 15,000

                                                                      54



            1  barrels per day.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And the 15,000 -- sorry.

            3  Strike that.

            4                The up to 15,000 barrels per day is part of

            5  the definition of contract quantity; is that right?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  And it's that contract quantity that Jamex is

            8  no longer purchasing and gives rise to your damages

            9  calculation; is that right?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  I want to just figure out --

           13  this might be easier.

           14                (Deposition Exhibit 239 marked for

           15                 identification.)

           16       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  I've handed you what I've

           17  marked as 239.  I have poor eyesight and this is slightly

           18  larger.

           19                Is this the same 4.1.1 that defines

           20  contract quantity as the provision in the agreement?

           21       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  Yes, it appears to be.

           22       Q.  I just want to figure out, so that we can talk

           23  about the same things, what these defined terms mean.

           24                So first, can you just read into the record

           25  the first sentence of the definition of "contract

                                                                      55



            1  quantity"?

            2       A.  "The contract quantity of Crude Petroleum shall

            3  be the quantity of Crude Petroleum purchased by and

            4  delivered to" -- how is that pronounced, that acronym?

            5                MR. MARKETOS:  STUSCO.

            6       A.  -- "STUSCO at the Receipt Point from Producer

            7  pursuant to the Supply Agreement up to 15,000 barrels per

            8  day."

            9       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  So for ease of reference,

           10  let's call STUSCO Shell.

           11                Does that make it easier?

           12       A.  I love that.

           13       Q.  Okay.  And the receipt point, that's the

           14  Robinson Lake location I think that you mentioned

           15  earlier, true?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  And producer, that's Whiting, right?

           18       A.  That's my understanding, yes.

           19       Q.  And the supply agreement is defined as the

           20  agreement between Whiting and Shell, true?

           21                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           22       A.  I assume that to be the case.  I can't tell

           23  that from this -- just this paragraph right here.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Gotcha.  If you look at -- I'm

           25  not trying to trick you.  If you look at 1.3 of

                                                                      56



            1  Exhibit 2 --

            2       A.  Yes.  It references the Shell/Whiting Agreement

            3  of May 13, 2015.

            4       Q.  So the 15,000 barrels a day at issue in this

            5  case is the contract quantity.  I just want to make sure

            6  that we now have the same understanding of this, Shell

            7  instead of STUSCO runs things at a receipt point.

            8                So the -- the shall -- the -- strike that.

            9                The Shell/Jamex Agreement defines contract

           10  quantity as a quantify of crude petroleum purchased by

           11  and delivered to Shell at the inlet flange of the

           12  Robinson Lake pipeline from Whiting pursuant to the

           13  Whiting/Shell Agreement up to 15,000 barrels per day,

           14  true?

           15       A.  That's my understanding.

           16       Q.  And this case is about -- and contract quantity

           17  is about oil that was purchased by and delivered to

           18  Shell, right?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  And it was sold to Shell by Whiting, right?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  And to count as contract quantity crude, the

           23  oil had to be delivered to Shell at the inlet flange of

           24  Robinson Lake, true?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                      57



            1       A.  That's my understanding.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And under the Jamex/Shell

            3  Agreement, Jamex was only entitled to purchase the

            4  contract quantity of crude as opposed to any other oil

            5  that Shell might have anywhere else in the world, right?

            6       A.  My understanding, that the -- the crude oil

            7  covered by the Jamex/Shell Agreement related to this

            8  15,000 barrels, if that answers the question.

            9       Q.  And the same 15,000 barrels produced by

           10  Whiting, sold to Shell, and delivered to Shell at

           11  Robinson Lake, true?

           12                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           13       A.  That's my understanding.

           14       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And so on a day where Whiting

           15  delivered 15,000 barrels of crude to Shell at Robinson

           16  Lake, Jamex could have purchased and made a profit on

           17  those 15,000 barrels, right?

           18       A.  My understanding is that per the Jamex/Shell

           19  Agreement, Jamex was to purchase from Shell at Robinson

           20  Lake and resell to Shell at Stanley and for that 20 or so

           21  miles of pipeline serve as the shipper in exchange for

           22  the buck 40 a barrel fee.

           23                The -- your question implied that there was

           24  some arbitrage or -- to sell at a profit.  There was a

           25  fee associated with Jamex's performance under the

                                                                      58



            1  Jamex/Shell Agreement, but they weren't buying and

            2  selling oil at some differential related to index changes

            3  or the price of oil or any of that kind of thing.  So I

            4  was a little bit confused by -- by that part of your

            5  question.

            6                MR. CARLIS:  So I'll move to strike your

            7  answer as nonresponsive, but I'll try and give you a

            8  clearer answer that eliminates the -- the profit problem.

            9       A.  Okay.

           10       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  On a day where Whiting

           11  delivered 15,000 barrels of crude to Shell at Robinson

           12  Lake, Jamex under its agreement with Shell could have

           13  purchased those 15,000 barrels, true?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And I think you referred to it as a fee, but

           16  Jamex ultimately would recover $1.40 per barrel through

           17  its buy/sell transaction with Shell, true?

           18                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           19       A.  It would net 1- -- 1.40 per barrel, yes.

           20       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And it's that $1.40 that you

           21  believe is profit to Jamex, true?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  You understand from the Jamex/Shell Agreement

           24  that the -- that that agreement contemplates situations

           25  where Jamex might buy fewer than 15,000 barrels on a

                                                                      59



            1  given day, right?

            2       A.  I believe the contract term that we've

            3  talked -- talked about and is here in 4.1.1 is up to

            4  15,000 barrels per day.

            5       Q.  And there -- there are situations contemplated

            6  by the agreement where Jamex might purchase less than

            7  15,000 barrels a day, true?

            8       A.  Ostensibly true, yes.

            9       Q.  And I'm not trying to trick you.  You can go to

           10  4.1.2.2.

           11                MR. MARKETOS:  You're referring to

           12  Exhibit 2?

           13                MR. CARLIS:  I am, yes.

           14       A.  (Examined exhibit.)

           15       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And that's a situation where

           16  Jamex might purchase fewer than 15,000 barrels a day from

           17  Shell at Robinson Lake, true?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  And in situations where Jamex purchases fewer

           20  than 15,000 barrels a day at Robinson Lake, it will have

           21  an opportunity to make the $1.40 on fewer barrels, right?

           22       A.  If that were to occur, that -- that -- that's

           23  possible.

           24       Q.  And Jamex only makes a profit on the barrels it

           25  purchased -- purchases from Shell at Robinson Lake,

                                                                      60



            1  right?

            2       A.  Under this agreement, yes.

            3       Q.  So -- and you understand that under the

            4  Whiting/Shell Agreement, Whiting could have -- had two

            5  options.  It could either, A, deliver 15,000 barrels of

            6  crude oil to Shell at Robinson Lake, or B, make a

            7  deficiency payment to Shell for barrels it did not

            8  deliver, right?

            9       A.  That's my understanding.

           10       Q.  And so let's -- let's assume for a moment that

           11  one day during the seven-year term of the Whiting/Shell

           12  Agreement, there was some kind of problem on Whiting's

           13  gathering system and it prevented Whiting from delivering

           14  any barrels to Robinson Lake.

           15                Under those circumstances, there'd be no

           16  contract quantity crude for Jamex to purchase for that

           17  day, right?

           18       A.  If I understand your hypothetical, that --

           19  that's true.

           20       Q.  And on a day where Whiting delivered no oil to

           21  Shell at Robinson Lake and thus there was no contract

           22  quantity crude for Shell to buy from Whiting and then

           23  sell to Jamex, Jamex would have no barrels to purchase

           24  under the Jamex/Shell Agreement, right?

           25       A.  I don't distinguish the difference in that

                                                                      61



            1  question.

            2                The previous question, if there is, that

            3  implies to me I need clarification, so . . .

            4       Q.  Sure.  I'm happy to -- to help.

            5                And the first hypothetical was just whether

            6  there was something there.

            7                The second is -- and I'll ask it again.

            8       A.  Okay.

            9       Q.  I think it -- it involves an extra party.

           10                So on a day where Whiting delivered no oil

           11  to Shell at Robinson Lake and thus there was no contract

           12  quantity crude for Shell to buy from Whiting and then

           13  sell to Jamex, Jamex would have no barrels to purchase

           14  under the Jamex/Shell Agreement, true?

           15       A.  If I'm following the hypothetical, that's true.

           16       Q.  And under that hypothetical on that day, Jamex

           17  would make no money, true, under the agreement?

           18       A.  I think that's right.

           19       Q.  My -- my understanding of your damages

           20  calculation is it assumes that Whiting would deliver

           21  15,000 barrels per day at Robinson Lake for the entire

           22  seven years of the contract; is that right?

           23       A.  It does assume that.  But my model also

           24  incorporates a discount rate to account for the risk that

           25  that doesn't happen, among other risks, as we've -- as

                                                                      62



            1  we've discussed.

            2       Q.  But the base from which you are discounting

            3  assumes the delivery of 15,000 barrels to Robinson Lake

            4  that are purchased by Jamex every day during the

            5  seven-year term of the agreement, right?

            6       A.  That's the starting point, correct.

            7       Q.  What did you do to assure yourself that Whiting

            8  would have the production capacity to deliver 15,000

            9  barrels per day to Robinson Lake in 2023?

           10       A.  I -- I have reviewed Whiting 10-Ks.

           11                I've reviewed other information about

           12  Whiting.

           13                They're clearly a very large -- more than a

           14  billion dollars in revenue in 2018, as I recall, very,

           15  very large company, a sophisticated oil and gas producer,

           16  and they entered into this particular contract that

           17  required them to produce this quantity of oil over this

           18  seven-year period or pay a deficiency payment, which is

           19  clearly incentive to provide the oil, but not incur that.

           20                So that among any other number of factors

           21  are some of the factors that I considered in -- in

           22  assessing that probability and that -- well, the

           23  probability that they would fulfill that seven-year

           24  commitment.

           25       Q.  Did you review Whiting's long-term production

                                                                      63



            1  estimates for the Stanis field in North Dakota?

            2       A.  I seem to recall that there's some information

            3  about that in its 10-K, but sitting here today, I don't

            4  recall specifics.

            5       Q.  And do you know -- feel free to look at your

            6  report -- the num- -- the total barrels of oil Whiting

            7  anticipates being able to deliver to Robinson Lake in

            8  2022?

            9       A.  I didn't discuss that specifically in my

           10  report.  I know that.  I don't recall whether I -- I

           11  reviewed that --

           12       Q.  And --

           13       A.  -- in my analysis.

           14       Q.  -- sitting here today, do you know what Whiting

           15  anticipates being able to deliver to Robinson Lake in

           16  2023?

           17       A.  Sitting here today, I don't recall.

           18       Q.  And if, for some reason, Whiting is unable to

           19  deliver 15,000 barrels a day, and as a result, as you

           20  said, has to pay deficiency payments, that would mean

           21  Jamex would make less money under the agreement if it had

           22  continued for seven years, right?

           23       A.  That's potentially true.  I -- I don't know

           24  legally if Jamex has any recourse in -- if there are

           25  deficiency payments made, if they have a claim to any of

                                                                      64



            1  those payments or not.  I -- I just don't know that one

            2  way or the other.

            3       Q.  You're unaware of any contracts at all between

            4  Jamex and Whiting governing these 15,000 barrels, true?

            5       A.  I'm not aware that one exists between those two

            6  parties.

            7       Q.  And you're unaware of any provision in the

            8  Jamex/Shell agreements that you've reviewed entitling

            9  Jamex to some portion of any deficiency payment, true?

           10       A.  I don't specifically recall that.  I don't

           11  think it's in there, but I'm not gonna say definitively

           12  it's not.

           13       Q.  Well, it's a pretty short agreement.  It's in

           14  front of you.  Let -- let me know if you see anything.

           15       A.  (Examined exhibit.)

           16                MR. MARKETOS:  Object to the form of the

           17  question.

           18       A.  I don't see anything specifically here, but,

           19  again, I'm reading this as a layperson, so I -- I'm not

           20  going to -- to weigh in on whether or not Jamex is

           21  foreclosed from any recovery under a deficiency scenario.

           22       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And in reviewing that contract

           23  for your expert reports and talking to the folks that you

           24  remember talking to and in reviewing it now, you don't

           25  recall and you don't see anything that would entitle

                                                                      65



            1  Jamex to some portion of the deficiency payments, do you?

            2       A.  No, I just recall that there was a -- that was

            3  perceived as a low probability event.

            4       Q.  The need for deficiency payments --

            5       A.  Correct.

            6       Q.  -- in the first place?

            7                Did you -- strike that.

            8                Let's talk about profits per barrel.

            9                Is it your opinion that Jamex would have

           10  netted a profit of $1.40 per barrel on each barrel it

           11  purchased from Shell at Robinson Lake?

           12       A.  Except for its cost of holding the line fill

           13  volume in inventory, yes.

           14       Q.  And in your analysis, the -- Jamex actually

           15  made a small profit on its line fill volume based on the

           16  termination, so it's not part of your calculation, true?

           17       A.  I believe that's Mr. Fuller's analysis you're

           18  thinking of.

           19       Q.  Okay.  Do you agree that there's no added

           20  damages based on the line fill cost to Jamex in this

           21  case?

           22       A.  I think we're passing each other here.  I

           23  actually calculated -- there are no additional damages.

           24                My analysis assumes that Jamex would in- --

           25  would have incurred a cost to hold the line fill until

                                                                      66



            1  the end of the seven-year term and that lowers the

            2  damages, so it lowers the $1.40 per barrel to something

            3  less than $1.40 per barrel on net.

            4       Q.  And so now I'm slightly confused.

            5                The existence of line fill requirements

            6  lowered Jamex's damages in this case.

            7                Is that your testimony?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  And putting line fill aside, the cost of

           10  holding line fill, it's your opinion that Jamex would

           11  have netted a profit of $1.40 per barrel on each barrel

           12  it purchased from Shell at Robinson Lake, true?

           13       A.  Excluding its line fill costs, yes.

           14       Q.  And did you confirm with Mr. Ballengee that

           15  Jamex was netting $1.40 per barrel in profit before Shell

           16  terminated the Jamex/Shell agreement?

           17                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And just to be clear, you

           20  don't reduce -- well, strike that.

           21                Putting aside the issue of line fill costs,

           22  you do not reduce the $1.40 by administrative costs or

           23  other costs associated with whatever work Jamex or

           24  Mr. Ballengee had to do under the Jamex/Shell Agreement,

           25  true?

                                                                      67



            1       A.  Correct.

            2       Q.  And that's because, in your opinion, putting

            3  aside line fill, there were no material costs to Jamex

            4  under the Jamex/Shell Agreement, right?

            5       A.  Aside from line fill related specifically to

            6  their performance under that contract once it began,

            7  that's correct.

            8       Q.  And so I understand your damages model, it also

            9  assumes that Shell would not have terminated the

           10  Shell/Jamex Agreement at some later date, right?

           11       A.  I don't believe that's right.

           12       Q.  And because you have a discount rate and it's

           13  your opinion that the possibility of future termination

           14  is built into the discount rate; is that right?

           15       A.  That's correct.

           16       Q.  But putting aside your discount rate

           17  calculation, you are -- your base starts with $1.40 per

           18  barrel times 15,000 barrels for every day of the

           19  seven-year contract, true?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And it -- although you've calculated Jamex's

           22  lost profits, you've not done any industry analysis to

           23  determine whether or not the payments to Jamex under the

           24  Jamex/Shell Agreement comport with industry norms, true?

           25       A.  True.

                                                                      68



            1       Q.  And you've not offered any opinions as to

            2  whether or not the payments to Jamex under the

            3  Jamex/Shell Agreement are consistent with the economic

            4  value to Shell of having Jamex in this deal, right?

            5       A.  I mean, I certainly considered Shell -- again,

            6  I believe give or take the third largest company in the

            7  world, and clearly a very sophisticated player in the oil

            8  and gas industry, sophisticated in negotiating contracts

            9  for -- for buying and selling oil.

           10                I -- they entered into this agreement

           11  essentially because they felt that there was an economic

           12  value for them to do so, so I considered that certainly.

           13                But beyond that, I didn't perform a

           14  specific analysis, if your question was that narrow.

           15                MR. CARLIS:  So I'll move to strike because

           16  I think it was.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You've not done any economic

           18  analysis to determine the value to Shell of having Jamex

           19  in the deal, right?

           20       A.  If my prior answer didn't answer your question,

           21  then no.

           22       Q.  And you have not done any economic analysis to

           23  determine the value to Whiting of having Jamex ship oil

           24  on Robinson Lake, true?

           25       A.  At the risk of being overbroad here, again,

                                                                      69



            1  Whiting is a seasoned producer and seller of -- of crude

            2  oil with long experience in selling it to Jamex and its

            3  prior entities.

            4                So -- but I didn't perform a specific

            5  economic analysis, and I'm not sure exactly what you're

            6  searching for in economic analysis because it's not a

            7  term of art.

            8                So I think the answer's no, as I understand

            9  your -- your use of the term "economic analysis."

           10                MR. CARLIS:  I'll move to strike and I'll

           11  try and be more clear.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Sitting here today, do you

           13  know whether or not -- strike that.

           14                Sitting here today, can you tell me how

           15  much money Shell saved by having Jamex in this deal?

           16                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And sitting here today, can

           19  you tell me how much money Whiting saved by having Jamex

           20  in this deal?

           21       A.  No.

           22       Q.  Jamex hasn't been an operating entity since

           23  June 30th of 2018, true?

           24       A.  I believe that's a correct date.  That's right.

           25       Q.  And Mr. Ballengee told you that before Jamex

                                                                      70



            1  went out of business, its operations entailed the

            2  purchase of crude oil at the wellhead for resale, right?

            3       A.  Yeah, I'm not sure that that's everything that

            4  the company did, but that's certainly a significant piece

            5  of its business is my understanding, yes.

            6       Q.  Well, turn to paragraph 8 of your first report.

            7       A.  (Complied.)  All right.  I have that.

            8       Q.  And second-to-last sentence you write, "Prior

            9  to winding down its business operations on or about

           10  June 30th, 2018, Jamex's business operations entailed the

           11  purchase of crude oil at the wellhead for resale," true?

           12                MR. MARKETOS:  We just -- we're on 236 --

           13  Exhibit 236, for the record?  I just want to be clear.

           14                MR. CARLIS:  We are.

           15                MR. MARKETOS:  Okay.  Thank you.

           16       A.  I'm sorry.  Can you point me to the paragraph

           17  again?

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Sure.

           19       A.  I wasn't finding that immediately.

           20       Q.  No problem.  Paragraph 8 --

           21       A.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I had page 8.

           22       Q.  -- of your July 12th report.

           23       A.  My bad.

           24       Q.  And it's on page 3.  The top of page 3 you

           25  write -- I'll give you a second.  Sorry.

                                                                      71



            1       A.  Okay.  I have that.

            2       Q.  The top of page 3 you write, "Prior to winding

            3  down its business operations on or about June 30th, 2018,

            4  Jamex's business operations entailed the purchase of

            5  crude oil at the wellhead for resale," true?

            6       A.  Yes, that's what it says.

            7       Q.  And you cite for support an interview with

            8  Mr. Ballengee, true?

            9       A.  That's one of two sources, yes.

           10       Q.  And the other one is Jamex's financial

           11  statements as of 2018, true?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  And so my question for you is:  Mr. Ballengee

           14  told you that before winding down its business operations

           15  on or about June 30th, 2018, Jamex's business operations

           16  entailed the purchase of crude oil at the wellhead for

           17  resale, right?

           18       A.  What Mr. Ballengee told me -- I don't remember

           19  verbatim -- supported that point because I've cited it as

           20  a source, but the Jamex financial statement also

           21  supported that.  I'd have to look at that statement.  I

           22  don't know if that's a typed paraphrase from that

           23  financial statement or the notes to that financial

           24  statement or whether I got it primarily from him and the

           25  financial statement provided added support, but both

                                                                      72



            1  sources support that notion.

            2       Q.  And the only business operations that you cite

            3  in your report is the purchase of crude oil at the

            4  wellhead, right?

            5       A.  That's the only thing specifically listed.

            6  This to me -- the use of the word "entailed" in that

            7  scenario doesn't mean to the exclusion of all other

            8  activities, but it certainly -- that was one of the

            9  things it did and -- and ostensibly one of the primary

           10  things that it did.

           11       Q.  Might have been other things like brokering

           12  deals, true?

           13       A.  That's potentially one -- one other activity,

           14  sure.

           15       Q.  And in this case, though, Jamex was not buying

           16  crude oil at the wellhead, true?

           17       A.  That's correct.

           18       Q.  Instead it was buying crude oil at the inlet

           19  flange of the Robinson Lake pipeline, right?

           20       A.  As the agreement ultimately was signed, that's

           21  my understanding, yes.

           22       Q.  So the footnotes in your reports identifies

           23  sources of information you've relied on to support the

           24  various assertions you make about the line, true?

           25       A.  That's the intent, yes.

                                                                      73



            1       Q.  And you made sure that the sources you cite to

            2  support your assertions are reliable sources, true?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  And sitting here today, you believe the sources

            5  you cite are reliable, right?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Indeed, you believe that the footnotes are

            8  integral parts of your expert reports, right?

            9       A.  I -- I say that because when I've included

           10  things in footnotes before that the attorney missed, then

           11  they want to pretend they're not important.  So I want to

           12  point out that there are footnotes and I want to make

           13  sure you read them.

           14       Q.  And you say it because it's true that the

           15  footnotes in your report are integral parts of your

           16  report, true?

           17       A.  I view them to be as important, yes.

           18       Q.  And one of the sources you cite is the sworn

           19  deposition testimony of Shell's Michael Grappaldi, right?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  And you made a determination that

           22  Mr. Grappaldi's testimony was reliable and therefore felt

           23  comfortable citing his testimony in your report, true?

           24                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           25       A.  I -- as with any other deposition testimony, I

                                                                      74



            1  view it as a sworn statement given under the penalty of

            2  perjury.  I don't take it as fact.  I understand that

            3  people lie under oath and that goes whether it's a party

            4  on my side of the case or on the opposing side of the

            5  case.  But it -- it is what it is.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Do you think that the

            7  statements that you cite in your report are reliable or

            8  not?

            9                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           10       A.  I -- I intend them to be -- if they're factual

           11  statements, I attempt to show the basis upon which I put

           12  those -- included those statements in my report so that

           13  the reader can ascertain the source of that and make his

           14  or her own judgments.

           15                I view them to be -- for example, we talked

           16  about my dispute section where much of that information

           17  is cited to a pleading, which by definition is one side's

           18  view of the world.  And I don't necessarily view that as

           19  fact.  It could be.  Certainly one party feels that

           20  that's fact, while the other party disputes some or all

           21  of those facts.  So I cite the source of it and it is

           22  what it is.

           23                A 10-K, as we've all found out, which is

           24  sworn to by the C-suite executives and filed with the

           25  Securities and Exchange Commission, sometimes contain

                                                                      75



            1  false statements.  Sophisticated people understand that,

            2  but still it's viewed as a credible source of information

            3  for a publicly traded company.

            4                So with that caveat, I attempt to give the

            5  reader my understanding of the facts and my basis for

            6  developing that understanding.

            7       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Well, let's put the dispute

            8  section aside for a moment and let's talk about the

            9  section of your report that you titled "Discussion and

           10  Analysis of Damages" where you lay out your opinions and

           11  support them with footnotes.

           12                Do you make sure that the sources you cite

           13  to support your assertions in the discussion and analysis

           14  section of your report are reliable sources?

           15                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           16       A.  I -- I attempt to find the most reliable

           17  sources available.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Okay.  And you cite

           19  Mr. Grappaldi's deposition testimony, page 10 of your

           20  second report in the Discussion and Analysis of Damages

           21  section, right?

           22       A.  (Examined exhibit.)  I'm sorry.  Can you point

           23  me to that again?

           24       Q.  Sure.  You can see it in Footnote 32.  It's

           25  Exhibit 237.

                                                                      76



            1       A.  I'm in the wrong report.  Let me grab that one.

            2                (Examined exhibit.)  Yes, I cite to

            3  Mr. Grappaldi's testimony.

            4       Q.  And you cite to Mr. Grappaldi's testimony in

            5  the Discussion and Analysis section of your report, true?

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  And you do that because Mr. Grappaldi was the

            8  most reliable source for that proposition, right?

            9                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           10       A.  I don't know that to be true.

           11       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Well, did you have more

           12  reliable sources for that proposition that you opted not

           13  to cite?

           14       A.  Not to my knowledge, but I don't purport to

           15  have access to any and everyone who could opine on this

           16  particular issue or has an opinion on this particular

           17  issue.

           18       Q.  Mr. Bell, the sources of which you're aware,

           19  Mr. Grappaldi's deposition testimony was the most

           20  reliable source to support that proposition and that's

           21  why you cited it, true?

           22                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.  Objection;

           23  misleading.

           24       A.  I don't know that to be -- but I don't know

           25  that to be true.  When you say "most accurate," I don't

                                                                      77



            1  know that to be true.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  I said of which you were

            3  aware.

            4                Are you aware of more reliable sources for

            5  that proposition?

            6       A.  Sitting here today, I'm not.

            7       Q.  In crafting your report, if you had more

            8  reliable sources, would you have cited them?

            9                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           10       A.  If it was a contentious point or -- or a point

           11  that I thought impacted significantly my damages analysis

           12  and I had conflicting sources, for example, then I would

           13  probably disclose that there were conflicting points of

           14  information.

           15                I don't recall that being the case in this

           16  particular instance.

           17       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You think it's important in

           18  your role as an expert to disclose conflicting sources,

           19  true?

           20       A.  If it's germane to my analysis.

           21       Q.  And in these reports, you did your best to

           22  disclose conflicting sources that would be germane to

           23  your analysis, right?

           24                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           25       A.  I attempted to disclose my opinions, the bases

                                                                      78



            1  for them, and I considered all the facts that I thought

            2  were relevant that -- that I had at my disposal -- at my

            3  disposal.

            4       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And did you cite to the facts

            5  that you thought were relevant or did you ignore and not

            6  cite to sources that you thought were unhelpful or

            7  contradicted the statements you were making in your

            8  report?

            9       A.  I sourced anything that I thought was relevant.

           10       Q.  A moment ago you said that some lawyers don't

           11  bother to read your footnotes and then complain later,

           12  true?

           13       A.  I've had that occur, yes.

           14       Q.  And you would like me to read your footnotes,

           15  true?

           16       A.  Yeah.  I welcome you to read them all.

           17       Q.  And between now and trial when I read them all,

           18  am I supposed to assume that you think that the stuff in

           19  your footnotes is accurate or -- or not?

           20                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           21       A.  To the best of my ability, everything contained

           22  in my report is accurate.

           23       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Including the footnotes, true?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  So when you cite Mr. Grappaldi, it's because

                                                                      79



            1  you think Mr. Grappaldi's being accurate, right?

            2                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            3       A.  On that particular point, I used his deposition

            4  testimony as support for his -- I believe it was his

            5  statement of opinion, but we can look at it.

            6                He was opining on a -- an e-mail that he

            7  had written, and so that is attempting to get into his

            8  head and he should know what's in his head.

            9                So on that point, if he's being factual, if

           10  he's being honest and candid and truthful, he is the best

           11  source for what was in his head.

           12       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Did you think he was being

           13  honest, candid, and truthful?

           14                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           15       A.  I didn't form a particular basis on that one

           16  way or the other.  He was under oath and made this

           17  statement and I cited to it.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  So he could have been lying

           19  about it; is that right?

           20                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           21       A.  That's possible.

           22       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And as you sit here today, are

           23  there any things that Mr. Grappaldi testified to that you

           24  think were lies?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                      80



            1       A.  I don't have an opinion that anything he said

            2  was factually wrong.

            3       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And if you --

            4       A.  I don't have a basis to say that.

            5       Q.  If you thought Mr. Grappaldi was testifying

            6  falsely, you wouldn't rely on that testimony, right?

            7       A.  I don't think it's -- it's my job to establish

            8  the truth or falsity of any witness's statement unless I

            9  have contemporaneous documents or other information that

           10  seems to be more credible or equally credible that

           11  refutes that.

           12                I'm not aware of any -- I haven't seen in

           13  this case, to my recollection, any information that

           14  refutes the point that I relied on him for that we were

           15  spending a ton of time on.

           16       Q.  And the same is true -- strike that.

           17                If you read his dep- -- I just want to

           18  understand this.  This is strange to me.

           19                If you read Mr. Grappaldi's testimony and

           20  you saw numerous instances where you thought he was lying

           21  under oath, would you, as an expert, still be comfortable

           22  relying on other testimony of his in your report?

           23                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           24       A.  I haven't conceived that hypothetical.  But,

           25  again, I try not to rely on one piece of information

                                                                      81



            1  alone if there are multiple pieces of information that

            2  support or shed light on that.

            3                I try to consider all information that's

            4  relevant and determine, if I have to, what is most

            5  credible in light of contemporaneous information in the

            6  whole of all evidence that I have at my disposal and make

            7  an assessment of what makes sense.  And that's what I did

            8  in this case and what I do in every case.

            9       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And here, though, you cited in

           10  Footnote 32 just the testimony of Mr. Grappaldi, true?

           11       A.  Yes, related to an e-mail that he had written.

           12       Q.  And do you think his testimony was truthful and

           13  reliable or not?

           14       A.  I have no reason to say it was not.

           15       Q.  And do you have any reason to say it was?

           16       A.  He -- other than to -- to point out, again,

           17  that he testified under oath as to that statement.

           18       Q.  And that's true of everything he testified to

           19  in his deposition, right?  He was under oath for the

           20  entirety of his deposition?

           21       A.  That's my assumption, yes.

           22       Q.  All right.  So the other things he said, as far

           23  as you're concerned, are as credible as this thing,

           24  right?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                      82



            1       A.  I'm not sure why you care so much about my

            2  opinion of his testimony.  He's gonna be -- the jury's

            3  ultimately gonna decide whether they believe him and all

            4  the other witnesses or not.

            5                But I have no basis to -- to say this

            6  statement was more true or less true than anything else

            7  he said, if that's what you're trying to get.

            8       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  I just want to understand the

            9  level of reliability you need as an expert to cite a

           10  source.

           11                And my understanding is Mr. Grappaldi met

           12  that threshold; is that right?

           13                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           14       A.  For the -- the fact I cited him for, yes -- or

           15  the statement that I cited him for, yes.

           16       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Because he was testifying

           17  under oath, true?

           18                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           19       A.  And he was the author of the e-mail that was in

           20  question for what I cited that for.

           21       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You state in your report that

           22  "The value Jamex added to the transaction covered by the

           23  Jamex/Shell Agreement related to its business

           24  relationships with Whiting and Shell and its ability to

           25  get the crude oil purchase/sale agreement in place,"

                                                                      83



            1  true?

            2       A.  I say that, if that's all I said.  I think

            3  there was a little bit more to it than that, but that's

            4  certainly a significant piece of it, in my view.

            5       Q.  And do you stand by that assertion?

            6       A.  I -- I -- again, with -- with the caveat I just

            7  mentioned, yes.

            8       Q.  You also say that "Whiting, in sharp contrast

            9  to Jamex, had never performed the role of shipper at the

           10  time it was negotiating the -- the Agreement with Shell,"

           11  true?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  Why is that statement relevant to your

           14  analysis?

           15       A.  That is in my response to Mr. Fuller's opinion

           16  that essentially Whiting would have had no incremental

           17  cost if it had moved into the role of shipper of record

           18  for the oil quantity in question.

           19                And I think it's significant that Whiting

           20  had never performed that role.  In some of the e-mails

           21  that I reviewed internally among Whiting employees as

           22  they were contemplating moving into that role, they were

           23  trying to figure out how to get approved as a shipper.

           24  They were discovering that they were going to have

           25  environmental and -- and other risks associated with

                                                                      84



            1  being the shipper that they hadn't previously

            2  contemplated, apparently, and -- and other factors that

            3  demonstrated considerable risk to Whiting and potential

            4  expense to get the people and expertise in place to

            5  perform the role of shipper of record.

            6       Q.  And do you stand by your statement that Whiting

            7  had never per- -- before performed the role of shipper?

            8                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            9       A.  That's my understanding from the information

           10  that I reviewed.

           11       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  If the information you

           12  reviewed is wrong, then you might be wrong, true?

           13       A.  That's conceivable.

           14       Q.  And what is the role of the shipper?

           15       A.  Well, to state the obvious, to move something

           16  from Point A to Point B.

           17       Q.  In this case the Point A to Point B was on a

           18  pipeline owned by Plains, true?

           19       A.  That's my understanding, yes.

           20       Q.  Plains controlled the pipeline, right?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Do you know who built the pipeline?

           23       A.  I don't know if I -- you mean physically built

           24  it?  Paid for it being built?  I'm not sure I know either

           25  of those, but --

                                                                      85



            1       Q.  Do you know who paid to build the pipeline?

            2       A.  I don't recall if I knew or not.  I -- I don't

            3  sitting here today.

            4       Q.  Do you know who the original owner of the

            5  pipeline was?

            6       A.  No.

            7       Q.  Did Mr. Ballengee tell you that Whiting had

            8  never before performed the role of shipper?

            9       A.  I don't recall his saying that, no.

           10       Q.  You state in your report that it's suspect that

           11  "Whiting could research and meet the requirements to

           12  become a shipper then allocate the necessary personnel to

           13  schedule shipments and perform accounting and other

           14  business functions around this new venture at zero cost,"

           15  true?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  And that's your opinion, true?

           18       A.  It is.

           19       Q.  You understand, Mr. Bell, that Whiting has been

           20  shipping its own crude on the Robinson Lake pipeline for

           21  more than a year now, right?

           22       A.  That's my understanding, yes.

           23       Q.  Do you have any understanding or any knowledge

           24  of how much it has cost Whiting to act as shipper on the

           25  Robinson Lake pipeline?

                                                                      86



            1       A.  I don't believe I've got any information that

            2  would allow me to determine that.

            3       Q.  So -- so you don't know whether or not there

            4  have been incremental costs to Whiting, fair?

            5       A.  I'm almost certain that there has to have been

            6  some costs, if nothing else, a cost to ensure that oil

            7  over that 20-mile span or so.  But I don't have any

            8  documentation that would allow me to quantify what that

            9  cost is.

           10       Q.  It's also possible that Whiting's current

           11  insurance would have covered the insurance for acting as

           12  shipper on the Robinson Lake pipeline, right?

           13                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           14       A.  I guess that's possible.  It's my experience

           15  with insurance companies that they normally don't accept

           16  more risk without compensation for accepting that risk,

           17  but I guess that's conceivable.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  You've never reviewed

           19  Whiting's insurance policies, true?

           20       A.  I have not.

           21       Q.  So putting aside the issue of insurance which

           22  you've not reviewed the policies for, are you aware of

           23  any incremental cost of Whiting of acting as shipper on

           24  this pipeline?

           25       A.  I'm not aware of any actual cost that I can

                                                                      87



            1  quantify in -- in the sense that I haven't received any

            2  information that would allow me to quantify.

            3                I've suggested some potential costs that

            4  they would incur or likely incur that were incremental in

            5  my report -- to be clear, my August 9 report.

            6       Q.  And in your August 9 report, you make no

            7  attempt to attach a value to those costs, true?

            8       A.  That is true.

            9       Q.  You state that "Mr. Fuller's discussion of the

           10  negotiation of the Whiting/Shell Agreement is highly

           11  selective and incomplete, and, as a result, misleading";

           12  is that right?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  And this goes back to your earlier testimony

           15  about disclosing conflicting evidence, right?

           16       A.  I think that's fair.

           17       Q.  And you discuss that same negotiation in your

           18  report, right?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  And do you believe that your discussion of that

           21  same negotiation is complete?

           22       A.  For purposes of my analysis, yes.

           23       Q.  Did you omit anything that you deemed material

           24  about those negotiations from your report?

           25       A.  No.

                                                                      88



            1       Q.  And do you believe your report fairly and

            2  accurately reflects Mr. Grappaldi's testimony about those

            3  negotiations?

            4       A.  I don't specifically recall, but to my

            5  knowledge, it does.

            6       Q.  You also state in your report that "Nowhere

            7  does Mr. Fuller address the significant difference in

            8  term length or what impact this difference might have on

            9  the negotiated price adjustment," true?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Mr. Bell, do you know what the average

           12  differential for oil sold at Stanley, North Dakota, was

           13  in January of 2015?

           14       A.  No.

           15       Q.  And do you know what the average differential

           16  for oil sold at Stanley on January 1, 2015, at the

           17  Robinson Lake pipeline was?

           18       A.  No.

           19       Q.  In 2017, for the year what was the average

           20  differential for oil sold at Stanley?

           21       A.  I don't know.

           22       Q.  What about the average differential for oil

           23  sold at the inlet flange of the Robinson Lake pipeline in

           24  2017?  Do you know that?

           25       A.  No.

                                                                      89



            1       Q.  Do you have any reason to believe that Jamex

            2  would have received more than $1.40 per barrel had this

            3  been a 10-year deal?

            4                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

            5       A.  I don't have an opinion on that.

            6       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And do you have any reason to

            7  believe that Jamex would have received less than $1.40

            8  per barrel had this been a 5-year deal?

            9                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           10       A.  I don't have an opinion on that.

           11       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And you're not offering any

           12  opinion on whether or not Shell would've agreed to a

           13  minus 640 differential rather than a minus 780

           14  differential depending on the length of the deal, are

           15  you?

           16       A.  I'm not here to opine on what Shell would or

           17  would not have agreed to, but I -- I am of the opinion

           18  that a 7-year deal versus a 10-year deal, that -- that

           19  term difference is significant -- or potentially

           20  significant.

           21       Q.  But you don't know -- let me ask you this:  Do

           22  you know what the average differential was on 10-year

           23  deals for oil sold at Stanley in 2017?

           24       A.  No.

           25       Q.  Do you know what the average differential was

                                                                      90



            1  on 7-year deals for oil sold at Stanley in 2017?

            2       A.  No.

            3       Q.  You don't know whether or not Shell would have

            4  insisted on a different differential for a 10-year deal

            5  than for a 7-year deal, true?

            6       A.  I don't know that definitively.

            7       Q.  You state that Jamex's 2015 revenue totaled

            8  more than 2.6 billion, true?

            9       A.  Say the year again, please.

           10       Q.  2015.

           11       A.  I believe that's right, yes.

           12       Q.  Why is it relevant to your analysis that

           13  Jamex's 2015 revenue totaled more than 2.6 billion?

           14       A.  In my world, 2.6 billion is a significant

           15  amount of money.  That indicates a significant scope of

           16  operations, and 2015 is the year that the parties began

           17  discussing this deal is my under- -- well, I think they

           18  actually started discussing it toward the end of 2014.

           19  But anyway, 2015 was a significant year among the parties

           20  to this deal.

           21       Q.  Do you believe Jamex was a profitable company

           22  in 2015?

           23       A.  I would have to look back at the financial

           24  statements for 2015.  I don't -- I don't recall when

           25  their profitability flipped.

                                                                      91



            1       Q.  Because revenue's just one part of the

            2  equation, right?

            3       A.  Depending on the equation, but I assume the

            4  equation you're talking about, yes.

            5       Q.  If your costs are higher than your revenue,

            6  you're not profitable, right?

            7       A.  Correct.

            8       Q.  But you don't know sitting here today whether

            9  Jamex's revenue in 2015 was more than 2.6 bil- -- I'm

           10  sorry, strike that.

           11                You don't know sitting here today whether

           12  Jamex's costs in 2015 were higher than its revenue, do

           13  you?

           14       A.  Sitting here today, without looking back at --

           15  at my analysis of the financial statements, I don't

           16  remember.

           17       Q.  Would you be surprised to learn that Jamex lost

           18  $86 million in 2015?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  What was Jamex's 2016 revenue?

           21       A.  Sitting here today, I don't remember.  I've

           22  looked at the financials, but I don't remember sitting

           23  here today.

           24       Q.  Do you know how it compares to its expenses?

           25       A.  I don't believe they turned a profit in 2016.

                                                                      92



            1       Q.  It's your understanding that Jamex had a loss

            2  in 2016 as well, true?

            3       A.  Yes.  2016, to be clear, I think we're only

            4  dealing with a half a year because I believe that's the

            5  year they wound down the company and there were wind-down

            6  expenses and other things involved, but I -- I'm certain

            7  that they recorded a loss.

            8       Q.  Okay.  Who other than Shell purchased oil from

            9  Jamex in Q1, 2017?

           10       A.  I don't know.

           11       Q.  Are you aware of any other contracts for the

           12  purchase or sale of oil or gas involving Jamex that were

           13  in place in June of 2017?

           14       A.  Again, my understanding is they wound down the

           15  company in June of 2016, so I don't -- I don't believe

           16  they had ongoing operations in 2017.

           17       Q.  Other than its contract with Shell, how else,

           18  if at all, was Jamex generating income in 2017?

           19       A.  I'm not aware of its other operations

           20  specifically as relates to counterparties or contracts.

           21       Q.  Okay.  You don't have any financial information

           22  about Jamex demonstrating that it was in good financial

           23  health as of Q1, 2017, true?

           24       A.  True.

           25       Q.  And you agree that Jamex's size, balance sheet

                                                                      93



            1  strength, and recent operating results, standing alone,

            2  would justify an upward adjustment to the

            3  industry-derived WACC, true?

            4       A.  All other factors equal, depending on the

            5  context and caveats I included with that statement, yes.

            6       Q.  And as far as you understand it, is the -- was

            7  the entire scope of Jamex's business operations in 2017

            8  this agreement with Shell?

            9       A.  I believe this was a very significant piece of

           10  it.  I don't know that it was 100 percent of it.

           11       Q.  Do you know of anything else that Jamex was

           12  doing in 2017 other than its agreement with Shell?

           13       A.  I understand that it was involved in numerous

           14  pieces of litigation that were ongoing with -- with

           15  multiple parties.

           16                As far as other contracts, as I've said,

           17  I'm not aware of anything in particular --

           18       Q.  And you understand --

           19       A.  -- in particular.

           20       Q.  -- that in many of those cases, Jamex was the

           21  defendant, right?

           22                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

           23       A.  That's my understanding.

           24       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Okay.  All right.

           25                THE WITNESS:  This is officially the most

                                                                      94



            1  boring deposition I've ever done, based on the lighting

            2  response.

            3                THE COURT REPORTER:  We need a break --

            4                MR. CARLIS:  That's not very --

            5                THE COURT REPORTER:  -- pretty quick here.

            6                MR. CARLIS:  Oh, we do?  Well, we can take

            7  one right now.

            8                THE COURT REPORTER:  Is right now good?

            9                MR. CARLIS:  Yeah.

           10                THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.

           11                MR. CARLIS:  If your fingers are tired, we

           12  have to stop.

           13                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off record at 11:55 a.m.

           14                (A recess was taken from 11:55 a.m. to

           15                 12:02 p.m.)

           16                THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back on record at

           17  12:02 p.m.

           18       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  Mr. Bell, can you describe for

           19  the jury your understanding of the scope of Jamex's

           20  business operations in quarter 1, 2017?

           21       A.  If I have my dates correct, the company was

           22  essentially wound down at that point and there was some

           23  ongoing litigation, but essentially the company was wound

           24  down.

           25       Q.  And can you describe for the jury the scope of

                                                                      95



            1  Jamex's business operations in the summer of 2016?

            2       A.  I believe the wind-down occurred on or around

            3  June 30 of 2016.  And so ostensibly there weren't

            4  ongoing -- significant ongoing business operations past

            5  that point.

            6       Q.  And what -- strike that.

            7                What benchmark companies did you use in

            8  your analysis?

            9       A.  The companies that comprised SIC Code 5172.

           10       Q.  And what are those companies, the names of

           11  those companies?

           12       A.  Without looking at my file, I don't know that I

           13  could name them all.  I think Sunoco is one of them, but

           14  I don't recall without looking back at my file.

           15       Q.  Is this the file?

           16       A.  That has what I think I need to answer the

           17  question, yes.

           18       Q.  Great.  Help yourself.

           19       A.  (Examined document.)  Okay.  For my analysis

           20  that used data for December 31, 2017, March 2018, those

           21  companies were World Fuel Services Corporation, Sunoco,

           22  LLP --

           23       Q.  I'm sorry.  I'm just gonna write them down and

           24  it takes me longer to write them down.

           25       A.  I'm sorry.

                                                                      96



            1       Q.  So World Fuels --

            2       A.  Services Corporation.

            3       Q.  -- Services Corp.

            4                Okay.  The second?

            5       A.  Sunoco.

            6       Q.  Will you spell that for me?

            7       A.  S-u-n-o-c-o.

            8       Q.  Okay.

            9       A.  Third one is Genesis Energy.

           10       Q.  Okay.

           11       A.  The fourth is CrossAmerica Partners.

           12       Q.  Okay.

           13       A.  The fifth is Adams Resources and Energy.

           14       Q.  Okay.

           15       A.  The last is Martin Midstream Partners.

           16                And for my analysis for the later period,

           17  it's the same except Martin Midstream Partners doesn't

           18  make an appearance.

           19       Q.  Can you describe the scope of business

           20  operations of World Fuel Services Corp.?

           21       A.  It was the single largest company in this --

           22  under this SIC code.  And the SIC code, to be clear, is

           23  described as petroleum and petroleum producer -- I'm

           24  sorry, petroleum and petroleum products wholesalers,

           25  except bulk station and -- bulk stations and terminals.

                                                                      97



            1       Q.  Okay.  But can you describe for the jury the

            2  scope of business operations for World Fuel Services?

            3       A.  Not in -- not in detail, no.  They were

            4  involved in the space which I determined and

            5  Mr. Ballengee confirmed was the most relevant SIC code

            6  for Jamex Marketing, the Jamex entity we're dealing with.

            7       Q.  Do you know whether it was an operating company

            8  in 2017?

            9       A.  However you define "operating company."

           10                Was it in --

           11       Q.  Did it exist --

           12       A.  -- in business, in existence?

           13       Q.  -- in revenue?

           14       A.  Yes, it existed.

           15       Q.  How much was its revenue in 2017?

           16       A.  You say 2017?

           17       Q.  Or 2018?

           18       A.  So some of this information is on a fiscal year

           19  basis.  Some of it's on a calendar year basis.  But the

           20  revenue number that was cited for it was 33.7 billion.

           21       Q.  And do you know what its profits were during

           22  the relevant period?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  Do you have any way of knowing whether it was

           25  operating in the red or the black?

                                                                      98



            1       A.  There are profitability metrics in the data,

            2  but it's given on a median basis, not a company-specific

            3  basis; so no, I don't have that in front of me.

            4       Q.  What's the median profitability for these

            5  businesses?

            6       A.  The -- the profitability ratio was 2.0.

            7       Q.  Can you explain to the jury what a

            8  profitability ratio of 2.0 means?

            9       A.  Essentially an operating margin.  And this is a

           10  median, so, I mean, I -- I'd have to look at -- at how

           11  that's calculated on this par- -- for this particular

           12  data source.

           13       Q.  What do you mean by "operating margin"?

           14       A.  Operating margin is the -- interchangeable with

           15  profit margin.

           16       Q.  Okay.  So the median has a -- of these

           17  companies has a positive profit margin of 2.0?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  And is there a way, then, to tell if you have a

           20  company with $33 billion in revenue, what a -- what --

           21  assuming that company sat at the median, what its profits

           22  would be for the year?

           23       A.  I don't want to go on record saying what that

           24  is because I don't want to misinterpret this data.  I'd

           25  have to look at how they calculated this particular

                                                                      99



            1  ratio.

            2                But I recall -- yeah, I just recall -- I

            3  don't recall sitting here today what that -- what that

            4  was for -- for World Fuel Services or these other five

            5  companies that I mentioned.

            6       Q.  The median of these companies is profitable,

            7  true?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  What was Sunoco's revenue?

           10       A.  11.7 billion.

           11       Q.  What was Genesis Energy's revenue?

           12       A.  2 billion.

           13       Q.  What was -- I'm sorry, did you say -- I

           14  can't -- I cannot read my own handwriting -- Crux

           15  American?

           16       A.  CrossAmerica.

           17       Q.  CrossAmerica.

           18                What was its revenue?

           19       A.  1.8 billion.

           20       Q.  What about Adams Resources?

           21       A.  1.1 billion.

           22       Q.  What about Martin Midstream?

           23       A.  946,000 -- I'm sorry.  946 million.

           24       Q.  Other than revenue and operating -- median

           25  operating margin, what other information about the scope

                                                                     100



            1  of business operations do you have for these six

            2  companies?

            3       A.  Well, as -- you'll have this when I -- when I

            4  give it to you, but there is a -- a wealth of information

            5  available for these -- these companies or for this SIC

            6  code is really how the data's presented.

            7       Q.  You don't have the data on a company-by-company

            8  basis.  The data is for code-wide; is that true?

            9       A.  Yes, that's correct.

           10       Q.  And that was the comparison you did was between

           11  Jamex and the -- the companies that sat within this SIC

           12  code generally, true?

           13       A.  Correct.

           14       Q.  So you don't know whether -- strike that.

           15                So other than revenue and operating margin,

           16  what other information did you look at for these

           17  companies?

           18       A.  Well, on a company basis, the assets are also

           19  provided.  The rest of the information's aggregated for

           20  the SIC code.

           21       Q.  And when you say "the assets," is it the -- the

           22  dollar value of the assets or the specific assets owned?

           23       A.  The dollar value of total assets.

           24       Q.  What are the dol- -- the dollar value of total

           25  assets for World Fuel Services Corp.?

                                                                     101



            1       A.  This is not the best copy in the world, but I

            2  believe it to be in the same order.

            3                World Fuel Services was 5.6 billion.

            4                Sunoco was 8.3 billion.

            5                Genesis was 7.1 billion.

            6                CrossAmerica was 932 million.

            7                Adams was 247 million -- million, I

            8  believe.

            9                And Martin was 1.3 billion.

           10       Q.  And can you just confirm for me what the time

           11  period this data attaches to?

           12       A.  The source indicates that the data was updated

           13  through March 31, 2018.

           14                And so again to my earlier point, some of

           15  this information may be on a fiscal year basis.  Some of

           16  it may be on a calendar year basis -- or some of these

           17  companies' fiscal years may co- -- coincide with a

           18  calendar year.  I don't -- I don't know that sitting

           19  here.

           20       Q.  On the issue of damages mitigation, you offer

           21  the opinion that entering into another contract to ship

           22  oil in the Robinson Lake pipeline would not have

           23  mitigated Jamex's damages because it could have done both

           24  that contract and the Shell contract, true?

           25                MR. MARKETOS:  Objection; form.

                                                                     102



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  (BY MR. CARLIS)  And would Jamex have been able

            3  to get the additional capacity on the Robinson Lake

            4  pipeline to move, say, 30,000 barrels rather than 15,000

            5  barrels a day?

            6       A.  I don't know specifically.  I do know that in

            7  the recent past, prior to this deal, Jamex had been the

            8  top three purchaser of Whiting crude at that point -- I

            9  mean, that geographic point, and accounted for, as I

           10  recall, 8 to 12 percent or so of Whiting's production,

           11  which certainly exceeded 15,000 barrels per day.  I

           12  recall 30,000 to 45,000 barrels being a volume not too

           13  much earlier, I believe, than when this deal was struck.

           14  So I know that there was some other capacity.

           15       Q.  You don't know whether or not those barrels

           16  that you just referenced were being shipped on the

           17  Robinson Lake pipeline, though, true?

           18       A.  Sitting here today, I don't remember.

           19       Q.  They could have been trucked, for example?

           20       A.  That's possible.

           21       Q.  Could have been shipped on a different

           22  pipeline, true?

           23       A.  I can't remember enough detail to disagree.

           24  That is possible.

           25       Q.  And in 2017, you don't know whether or not

                                                                     103



            1  there was sufficient capacity on the Robinson Lake

            2  pipeline such that Plains would let Jamex ship 30,000

            3  barrels a day, true?

            4       A.  I don't know that.

            5       Q.  You also state, "I understand that Jamex does

            6  not have an obligation to mitigate harm suffered from

            7  Whiting's tortious interference."

            8                Who told you that?

            9       A.  That's my understanding from counsel.

           10                MR. CARLIS:  Well, I don't have any more

           11  questions for you.  Thank you for your time.

           12                THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           13                MR. MARKETOS:  We'll reserve.  Thank you.

           14                MR. CARLIS:  Time to go to the sculpture

           15  garden.

           18                THE COURT REPORTER:  Mr. Marketos, would

           19  you like him to read and sign?

           20                MR. MARKETOS:  Read and sign, please.

           21                THE WITNESS:  Do you need any spellings?

           22                THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.

           23                Did you want regular delivery?

           24                MR. CARLIS:  I'd like a rough, please, and

           25  then I don't care what happens next, so it's whatever --

                                                                     104



            1                THE COURT REPORTER:  That's fine.

            2                MR. CARLIS:  -- Richard says.

            3                THE COURT REPORTER:  Pete, do you want a

            4  rough?

            5                MR. MARKETOS:  By any chance -- I don't

            6  need one.

            7                THE COURT REPORTER:  Regular delivery is

            8  what's happening.  Rough for him, not for you.  Got it.

            9                MR. CARLIS:  Do you by any chance --

           10                MR. MARKETOS:  I'll take a rough.  I'm

           11  sorry.  Just to mess you up.

           12                THE COURT REPORTER:  Okay.

           21       I, Karen L. D. Schoeve, Certified Shorthand

           22  Reporter, in and for the State of Texas, hereby certify

         10                    CHRISTOPHER CARROLL,

         11   called as a witness, having been first duly sworn to

         12   tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the

         13   truth, was examined and testified as follows:

         14                  EXAMINATION BY MR. BYRON

         15        Q      We met briefly off the record, but for the

         16   record, will you state your full name?

         17        A      Sure.  My name is Christopher Antoine

         18   Carroll.

         19        Q      And, Mr. Carroll, where do you currently

         20   live?

         21        A      I currently live in Bristow, Virginia.

         22        Q      My name is -- I introduced myself

         23   earlier -- is John Byron and I'm with the law firm of

         24   Norton Rose Fulbright and our law firm represents State

         25   Center, LLC and other development entities in a lawsuit




                                                                        6



          1   that's been filed by certain departments and agencies

          2   of the State of Maryland.

          3               Do you understand that?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      You understand that this deposition is

          6   being taken as part of that case?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      Have you ever been deposed before, Mr.

          9   Carroll?

         10        A      No.

         11        Q      Do you understand that today's testimony is

         12   under oath?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      And it has the same force and effect as if

         15   it was in trial?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      Before a court of law?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      So before we begin, since you haven't been

         20   deposed before, I'm going to go over a few ground

         21   rules.  Is that okay?

         22        A      Sure.

         23        Q      As you can see, the deposition is being

         24   reported by a court reporter today and he can only take

         25   one of us down at a time.  So that means we need to




                                                                        7



          1   take turns speaking.  Can you and I agree that we'll

          2   take turns speaking during the course of the

          3   deposition?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      There may be times when Mr. Rosenfeld

          6   asserts an objection to a question that I have.  Unless

          7   he tells you not to answer the question, you're

          8   required to answer my question.  Do you understand

          9   that?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      You need to, of course, for the court

         12   reporter's purposes answer all of my questions

         13   verbally.  Uh-huh, uh-uh, nonverbal gestures like

         14   shaking heads, nodding your head cannot be picked up by

         15   our court reporter no matter how good he is.  So please

         16   answer all my questions verbally.  Can you agree that

         17   you will answer my questions verbally?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      If you don't understand a question as I'm

         20   not always the best questioner, please ask me to

         21   rephrase it.  I'm not trying to trick you with my

         22   questions.  I want to make sure you understand them and

         23   I understand your answer.  So if I ask a question that

         24   isn't understandable to you, will you please ask me to

         25   rephrase it?




                                                                        8



          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      If you don't ask me to rephrase it, I'll

          3   assume that you understand it.  Okay?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      So as I mentioned before this deposition

          6   began, I expect to go probably between 2 and 3 hours

          7   today.  This is not a marathon session.  If you need a

          8   break during those 2 to 3 hours, please ask me.  I will

          9   take a break just as a matter of habit about every

         10   hour.  But if you need a break before I call a break,

         11   please ask me and I'm happy to give it to you.  Is that

         12   okay?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      But I just ask don't do it during a pending

         15   question.  Okay?

         16        A      Okay.

         17        Q      All right.  So, Mr. Carroll, where are you

         18   currently employed?

         19        A      I'm currently employed at the Maryland

         20   Department of Information Technology.

         21        Q      How long have you been with the Maryland

         22   Department of Information and Technology?

         23        A      One year.

         24        Q      What is your current position at the

         25   Maryland Department of Information Technology?




                                                                        9



          1        A      I'm the chief of staff.

          2        Q      What are your responsibilities generally in

          3   that role?

          4        A      My primary responsibilities are oversee the

          5   finance division of the agency, procurement within the

          6   agency, communications and legislative affairs.

          7        Q      Just briefly on each of those, when you say

          8   oversee the finance division, what do you mean by

          9   overseeing the finance division?

         10        A      So we have a chief financial officer.

         11   She's responsible for the finances of the department,

         12   all the different divisions within the department,

         13   budgets, et cetera, or budgets primarily.

         14        Q      And procurement process, what do you mean

         15   by overseeing the procurement process?

         16        A      So the Department of Information Technology

         17   oversees technology procurements for the state.  So our

         18   office has a responsibility to make sure there's --

         19   they're compliant, that they are in alignment with the

         20   state's technology master plan, and they're consistent

         21   with the direction of the state.

         22        Q      The last thing you mentioned was you were

         23   involved in legislative affairs.  What do you mean by

         24   that?

         25        A      So we have a communications team and a




                                                                       10



          1   legislative team.  They work together.  They oversee

          2   legislative initiatives for the department, changes in

          3   law that need to be brought before the general assembly

          4   and communications focuses on good news coming out of

          5   the department, press releases, any engagement the

          6   secretary of the department may have for interviews, or

          7   things like that of that nature.

          8        Q      I'm going to go ahead and hand you an

          9   exhibit that the court reporter has premarked as

         10   Exhibit 1.

         11               (Carroll Exhibit 1 was marked for purposes

         12   of identification.)

          9   for me?  Before today's deposition, did you have a

         10   chance to review Exhibit A to this notice?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      And you reviewed the topics on which my

         13   clients have asked for testimony from a representative

         14   of the Department of Information Technology, correct?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      Which topics in this Exhibit A are you

         17   sitting for your deposition today and to offer

         18   testimony on behalf of the Department of Information

         19   Technology?

         20        A      All of them, I believe, except the ones

         21   that are specific to current conditions which I believe

         22   are 18 through 22.

         23        Q      Okay.  Why don't we go through?  Just you

         24   can say 1, 2, 3, 4, et cetera, et cetera, as the ones

         25   you understand you're sitting for today.




                                                                       12



          1        A      Sure.  Number 1, number 2, number 3, number

          2   4, number 5, number 6, number 7, number 8, number 9,

          3   number 10, number 11, number 12, number 13, number 14,

          4   number 15, number 16, number 17.

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'll object briefly to

          6   clarify that Mr. Carroll's answer to number 8 that the

          7   efforts do and undertook to identify and produce

          8   documents concerning the occupancy leases (including

          9   any fully or partially signed or executed copies of the

         10   occupancy leases) in response to any discovery requests

         11   served upon it during the course of this lawsuit

         12   applies only to hard copy documents.  Something that --

         13   conversation counsel had off the record before the

         14   deposition.

         15               MR. BYRON:  Understood that for purpose of

         16   topic 8, the testimony Mr. Carroll will lay only to

         17   hard copy document identification, collection,

         18   production.

         19   BY MR. BYRON:

         20        Q      So with that caveat, you're sitting for

         21   topics 1 through 17, correct?

         22        A      That is correct.

         23        Q      And you're not sitting for topics 18

         24   through 22?

         25        A      That is correct.




                                                                       13



          1        Q      And you're prepared today to testify about

          2   topics 1 through 17?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      What did you do to prepare to testify about

          5   these topics?

          6        A      I spoke with individuals that are still

          7   employed with the Department of Information Technology,

          8   those two individuals being Betsy Jackson who is --

          9   well, she serves in a different capacity now, but she

         10   was the executive assistant for the secretary during

         11   this time period and Dave Mangrum who is currently our

         12   chief of infrastructure who is familiar with the needs

         13   of the agency as it pertains to the server room data

         14   center that was planned for the State Center

         15   redevelopment.

         16        Q      You said Ms. Jackson is or was the

         17   executive assistant to the secretary.  What secretary

         18   are you referring to?

         19        A      The secretary at the time would have been

         20   Garcia most recently and she supported Greg Urban in

         21   the past as well, but Greg Urban was the assistant

         22   secretary and deputy secretary at the time.

         23        Q      What did you talk to Ms. Jackson about?

         24        A      I asked Ms. Jackson about her familiarity

         25   with the needs of the agency as it pertained to the new




                                                                       14



          1   space, the planned redevelopment at State Center.  And

          2   she informed me that she knew very little other than

          3   there were details regarding the size of the room

          4   required the -- and other specifications that had been

          5   corresponded from Mr. Urban as his time there.

          6        Q      When did that conversation happen?

          7        A      This conversation happened -- what's

          8   today's date?  It would have happened on the 20th of

          9   this month.

         10        Q      Tuesday of this week?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      How long did you talk to Ms. Jackson for?

         13        A      Ms. Jackson and I probably had a

         14   conversation approximately 30 minutes.

         15        Q      And just so I understand again, she didn't

         16   have very much familiarity with the agency's needs

         17   except for maybe the space requirements for the data

         18   room?

         19        A      She would have had the requirements as they

         20   flowed through Greg Urban who at the time -- his

         21   capacity has changed, but during the time that he was

         22   the infrastructure chief, he was also the, you know,

         23   deputy secretary for the point down the line.  She

         24   would have had familiarity or she had familiarity with

         25   his correspondence regarding the needs for the space at




                                                                       15



          1   the redevelopment.

          2        Q      And she told you about the conversations

          3   that Mr. Urban was having?

          4        A      There were no conversations.  She was aware

          5   of -- she was aware of correspondence where she would

          6   have been copied or things have come up about that,

          7   need a meeting, need this email or something like that.

          8        Q      She told you there's correspondence that

          9   exists, but she didn't tell you what the substance of

         10   the correspondence was?

         11        A      I've seen the correspondence through the

         12   hard copy records.  It wasn't coming to the top of mind

         13   for Ms. Jackson.

         14        Q      You didn't really learn anything new from

         15   Ms. Jackson?

         16        A      No.

         17        Q      You said you also had a discussion with

         18   Mr. Mangrum?

         19        A      Mangrum.

         20        Q      Mangrum?

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      Is that M-A-N-G-R-U-M?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      When did the discussion with Mr. Mangrum

         25   occur?




                                                                       16



          1        A      That was also Tuesday, the 20th.

          2        Q      And how long did you speak with

          3   Mr. Mangrum?

          4        A      It was approximately 15 minutes.

          5        Q      And what did you and Mr. Mangrum talk

          6   about?

          7        A      We talked about his familiarity with the

          8   redevelopment project, State Center redevelopment

          9   project and the agency's involvement in that process.

         10   And he reiterated to me that he knew there were needs

         11   and specifications for the data center at State Center

         12   and that was the extent of his knowledge.

         13        Q      And did he refer you to correspondence to

         14   determine those needs?

         15        A      No.

         16        Q      He just said that there were needs?

         17        A      There were needs.  I had seen his hard copy

         18   correspondence just as I had with Ms. Jackson's, but he

         19   didn't recall any of the particulars.

         20        Q      So is it fair to say you didn't learn

         21   anything new from Mr. Mangrum either?

         22        A      That would be correct.

         23        Q      Aside from your meetings with Mr. Mangrum

         24   and Ms. Jackson, did you have any other meetings to

         25   prepare for today's deposition?




                                                                       17



          1        A      I made an attempt to reach out to

          2   Mr. Mallinoff, Michael Mallinoff who served at DOIT as

          3   the chief operating officer for a period of a year and

          4   was unsuccessful in connecting with Mr. Mallinoff.

          5   Also made an attempt to reach Mr. Greg Urban who had

          6   been in the department at the time throughout this

          7   process and was involved and was unsuccessful in

          8   connecting with Mr. Urban as well.

          9        Q      So you weren't successful in contacting or

         10   discussing -- having discussions with either of those

         11   folks?

         12        A      Correct.

         13        Q      As to Ms. Jackson, how long was her

         14   involvement in the State Center project?  From what

         15   year to what year was she involved in the State Center

         16   project?

         17        A      Ms. Jackson has been with the agency since

         18   2014.  So she would have been involved during that

         19   period.

         20        Q      2014 forward?

         21        A      Um-hmm.

         22        Q      What about Mr. Mangrum?

         23        A      Mr. Mangrum would have been involved --

         24   he's been with the agency since 2011 and he was not the

         25   chief of infrastructure at the time.  That would have




                                                                       18



          1   been Greg Urban, but he was on that team, so he would

          2   have been involved in understanding the needs for the

          3   data center from 2011 on.

          4        Q      Is it fair to say you didn't speak with

          5   anyone who was involved in the State Center project

          6   from the Department of Information Technology side

          7   prior to 2011?

          8        A      Correct.

          9        Q      Aside from Ms. Jackson, Mr. Mangrum,

         10   Mr. Mallinoff, and Mr. Urban, did you reach out to

         11   anyone else to talk about today's deposition?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Who else?

         14        A      I reached out to Ms. Kaitlin Marsdan who

         15   used to work at the Department of Information

         16   Technology as well.

         17        Q      What was her role?

         18        A      She was executive assistant to the

         19   secretary in 2015.

         20        Q      That would be Mr. Garcia?

         21        A      Yes, Mr. Garcia.

         22        Q      Were you successful in contacting Ms.

         23   Marsdan?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      When did you contact Ms. Marsdan?




                                                                       19



          1        A      I contacted Ms. Marsdan yesterday, the

          2   21st.

          3        Q      How long did you and Ms. Marsdan speak?

          4        A      We exchanged electronic correspondence

          5   email.

          6        Q      Okay.  How many emails did you exchange?

          7        A      Three.

          8        Q      What were you seeking from Ms. Marsdan?

          9        A      I was seeking to confirm her time at the

         10   agency.  She transitioned from the Department of

         11   Information Technology to the governor's office in

         12   November of 2016.  And I was seeking to confirm the

         13   timeframe that she was in the Department of Information

         14   Technology versus in the governor's office.

         15        Q      And was that the only thing you were

         16   seeking to confirm?

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      And did you confirm that?

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      Did you learn anything else from Ms.

         21   Marsdan?

         22        A      No.

         23        Q      I assume you met with your lawyers to

         24   prepare for today's deposition?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       20



          1        Q      How many times?

          2        A      Twice.

          3        Q      When was the first time you met with your

          4   lawyers?

          5        A      The 20th.

          6        Q      Tuesday?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      Was Mr. Rosenfeld and Mr. Harp present at

          9   that meeting?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      Was that an in-person meeting?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      How long did it go?

         14        A      Approximately two hours.

         15        Q      You said you had -- and that was the first

         16   meeting, correct?

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      When was the second meeting?

         19        A      The second meeting was yesterday.

         20        Q      Was that the 21st?

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      Was that an in-person meeting?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      Was Mr. Rosenfeld and Mr. Harp --

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       21



          1        Q      -- present?  And I should say were

          2   Mr. Rosenfeld and Mr. Harp present?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      Was anyone else present?

          5        A      No.

          6        Q      Was anyone else present for the first

          7   meeting?

          8        A      No.

          9        Q      How long was your meeting yesterday?

         10        A      Approximately two hours as well.

         11        Q      So in total, you spent about four hours

         12   meeting with lawyers to prepare for today's deposition?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      Did you review any documents to prepare for

         15   today's deposition?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      Which documents did you look at?

         18        A      I reviewed the hard copy documents that

         19   were searched for and produced.

         20        Q      When you say you reviewed the hard copy

         21   documents that were searched for and produced, what do

         22   you mean?

         23        A      Documents that the Department of

         24   Information Technology produced or were produced

         25   through a search.  I was able to see that as well as




                                                                       22



          1   email correspondence between or that involved State

          2   Center and the Department of Information Technology and

          3   the needs of the agency.

          4        Q      About how many documents did you look at?

          5        A      A lot.

          6        Q      More than ten?

          7        A      More than ten.  It was probably

          8   approximately 25 documents seems about right to me.

          9        Q      Aside from speaking with the individuals we

         10   mentioned and looking at hard copy documents, did you

         11   do anything else to prepare for today's deposition?

         12        A      No.

         13        Q      I want to talk about your preparation for

         14   the specific topics that are listed in Exhibit 1.  Did

         15   you do anything special to prepare for any of the

         16   topics listed in Exhibit 1?

         17               MR. ROSENFELD:  I would object to the

         18   extent that any preparation that took place with

         19   counsel is something that's protected as either an

         20   attorney-client privileged communication or attorney

         21   work product.  So I would instruct Mr. Carroll not to

         22   answer to the extent it refers back to preparation that

         23   took place during his meetings with myself and

         24   Mr. Harp.

          1        Q      Can you answer my question?

          2        A      No.

          3        Q      You can't answer it because -- you can't

          4   answer it because it would divulge privileged

          5   information?

          6        A      Correct.

          7        Q      During the course of your preparation, did

          8   you learn that the Department of Information Technology

          9   did not have any information on any of the topics that

         10   you're designated on in Exhibit A?

         11        A      Can you repeat the question?

         12        Q      Sure.  During the course of your

         13   preparation for today's deposition, did you learn that

         14   the Department of Information Technology did not have

         15   any information on any of the topics listed in Exhibit

         16   A that you were designated on?

         17               MR. ROSENFELD:  I would object to form.

         18               But you can answer that question.

         19               THE WITNESS:  Did I -- repeat that again.

         20   I'm sorry.

         21   BY MR. BYRON:

         22        Q      Sure.  You were designated on 17 topics --

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      -- in Exhibit A, correct?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       24



          1        Q      And you prepared to testify today about

          2   each of those 17 topics, correct?

          3        A      Correct.

          4        Q      And when you prepared to testify about each

          5   of those topics, did you learn that there was an

          6   absence of information at the Department of Information

          7   Technology on any of those topics?

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  I would object to form

          9   again.

         10               But you can answer.

         11               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         12   BY MR. BYRON:

         13        Q      Which ones?

         14        A      Where there was no information?

         15        Q      That the Department of Information

         16   Technology in the course of your preparation didn't

         17   have any responsive information to deliver to the

         18   questions to today's deposition.

         19               MR. ROSENFELD:  I would object to form

         20   again.

         21               But you can answer that question.

         22               THE WITNESS:  I would say that the

         23   Department of Information Technology did not have

         24   information regarding the negotiation and drafting of

         25   the master development agreement, the negotiation and




                                                                       25



          1   drafting of the phase ground leases, the negotiation

          2   and drafting of the component leases, the negotiation

          3   and drafting of the closing agreement.

          4   BY MR. BYRON:

          5        Q      And did you learn that the Department of

          6   Information Technology was just not involved in the

          7   negotiating and drafting of those documents?

          8        A      The Department of Information Technology

          9   was not involved in the negotiation or drafting of

         10   those documents.

         11        Q      So there was no information to obtain?

         12        A      There was no information that the

         13   Department of Information Technology has pertaining to

         14   those agreements.

         15        Q      I see in front of you there's a note pad

         16   with some notes on it.

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      What's on that note pad?

         19        A      On the note pad are details about the needs

         20   of the agency, specifically the occupancy leases and

         21   what the needs of the department were for space,

         22   storage, et cetera.  There's information about the

         23   individuals involved from the Department of Information

         24   Technology.  There is general information about the

         25   master development agreement found -- phase ground




                                                                       26



          1   lease agreements, component lease agreements, closing

          2   agreements in terms of what they are and the agency's

          3   involvement with that and then there is a section that

          4   is dedicated to the request for documents and when the

          5   searches -- search requests came in and how the agency

          6   responded.

          7        Q      So you haven't referred to that note pad

          8   yet during the course of answering my questions.  But

          9   to the extent that you use that note pad to refresh

         10   your recollection on a question, I'm going to ask that

         11   we mark the notes as an exhibit and we talk about the

         12   notes.

         13               MR. ROSENFELD:  I would object and

         14   absolutely instruct the witness not to do that and the

         15   court reporter not to do that because these notes were

         16   taken pursuant to our meetings and, therefore, are --

         17   either contain attorney-client communications or

         18   attorney work product.

         19               MR. BYRON:  I disagree with that.  So when

         20   you refer to a portion of your notes during the course

         21   of this testimony, I'm going to ask the question again.

         22   And he can object again and then we'll go ahead and

         23   move to compel those notes.  I'd ask you to preserve

         24   those notes.  Do not destroy them.  We're going to ask

         25   for those notes from the court if I use them in the




                                                                       27

         22   I did some campaign consulting for Andy Harris,

         23   Congressman Andy Harris until January of 2008.  Then I

         24   took a break and then I got a job at an organization

          1        Q      What is GOPAC?

          2        A      It's an organization that is focused on

          3   electing republicans at the state and local level,

          4   governors, attorney generals on down.

          5        Q      What was your role as political director?

          6        A      To identify campaigns where GOPAC could

          7   increase its involvement and help to -- help candidates

          8   across the country win in targeted races.

          9        Q      How many campaigns did you get involved in?

         10        A      Dozens.

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Over 50?

         14        A      Probably around 50.

         15        Q      What was the success rate?  I'm just

         16   curious.

         17        A      Pretty good.

         18        Q      Over 50?

         19        A      I don't know specifically.  We won a lot of

         20   legislative races.  It was a wave year or the beginning

         21   of a wave year.  So we picked up some attorney generals

         22   across the country, some governorships, things like

         23   that.

         24        Q      How long were you at GOPAC as political

         25   director?




                                                                       34



          1        A      As GOPAC's political director for the

          2   remainder of -- until March of 2009.

          3        Q      So you were at GOPAC from January 2008

          4   until March of 2009?

          5        A      Yes.

          6        Q      And in March of 2009, what did you do?

          7        A      I went to the -- took a job at the

          8   Republican National Committee.

          9        Q      What was your job there?

         10        A      My job at the Republican National Committee

         11   was a political liaison to the chairman of the

         12   committee again helping to identify those kind of

         13   targeted races that the organization could get involved

         14   and have an impact.  And I did that for -- I believe

         15   until the end of summer of that year.  So that would be

         16   August of 2009.  Then I became the deputy director of

         17   government affairs.

         18        Q      At the RNC still?

         19        A      Yes.  And that was primarily focused on

         20   establishing or improving relationships with our

         21   Republican elected officials across the country and

         22   coordinating on messaging and campaign efforts.

         23        Q      You started that in August of 2009?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      When did you end that?




                                                                       35



          1        A      That continued until -- until January of

          2   2011.

          3        Q      In January 2011, what happened?  What did

          4   you do?

          5        A      There was a new chairman elected to the

          6   Republican National Committee and that was the end of

          7   my tenure at the Republican National Committee.

          8        Q      Was there a reason for that?

          9        A      Just politics.  That's the way it goes.

         10        Q      He wanted his own guy?

         11        A      Yeah, bring in your own team.

         12        Q      Where did you go to work then?

         13        A      I took some more time off and did

         14   consulting.  I did consulting for -- I went to help Tom

         15   Rust again.  Tom was running for reelection in

         16   Virginia, had those relationships and then a little

         17   Andy Harris work as well, but that was it.

         18        Q      Do you consult under an entity or do you

         19   consult just as Chris Carroll, an individual?

         20        A      Just Chris Carroll.

         21        Q      How long were you consulting for?

         22        A      Until November of that year.

         23        Q      November 2011?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      Then did you get a new job in November of




                                                                       36



          1   2011?

          2        A      I got a new job, continued -- took more

          3   time off and then I got a job with the Associated

          4   Builders and Contractors in March of 2012.

          5        Q      What is that organization?

          6        A      They are a what you call a merit shop or

          7   merit based construction and trade association.  They

          8   represent non-union construction firms in Washington,

          9   D.C.  They have chapters all across the country.

         10        Q      Are they a lobbyist group?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      What was your position there?

         14        Q      What does that mean?

         15        A      My primary job was to train members across

         16   the country in terms of how to engage politically,

         17   develop relationships with their elected officials,

         18   have productive relationships, have those elected

         19   officials go visit plant construction sites and learn

         20   more about the construction industry and educate both

         21   sides, the elected officials as well as the members of

         22   the organization.

         23        Q      Is the goal of that organization to lobby

         24   for legislation that's anti-union?

         25        A      They would say that it's to be pro merit




                                                                       37



          1   shop, not anti-union.

          2        Q      Understood.  How long were you the director

          3   of grass roots at that organization?

         21   Governor Ehrlich, he was governor -- he was Governor

         22   Ehrlich's appointment secretary.

         23        Q      And he reached out to you to come work for

         24   him?

         25        A      A member of his team reached out to me.




                                                                       38



          1        Q      What did you do as the deputy legislative

          2   officer for Governor Hogan?

          3        A      I focused on legislation related to

          4   economic development, work force development,

          5   information technology, lottery and gaming.

          6        Q      Various legislation?

          8        Q      So you started in January of 2015 in that

          9   role.  How long were you in that role for?

         10        A      I was in that role until approximately July

         11   of 2017.

         12        Q      Is that when you came over to the

         13   Department of Information --

         14        A      No.  I then had a title change to become

         15   the policy and legislative director for Governor Hogan

         16   still working in the legislative shop, but just

         17   additional responsibilities regarding regulatory

         18   reform, staffing various commissions, et cetera, policy

         19   development.  Continued in that for a year and then I

         20   went to the Department of Information Technology.

          2        A      Correct.

          3        Q      What precipitated the move to the

          4   Department of Information Technology?

          5        A      Just a desire to have a singular focus, a

          6   topic information technology and kind of hone an

          7   expertise or a specialty.

          8        Q      So you asked for it?

          9        A      Yes.

         16        Q      I just have to remind you that we'll have

         17   to kind of take turns here.  I know I'm going slow.

         18   I'm doing that sort of intentionally for the court

         19   reporter's benefit.

         20        A      Sure.

         21        Q      You're doing a good job and I think -- just

         22   want to remind us not to talk over one another.  Was

         23   that position a position that had existed before the

         24   chief of staff of the Department of Information

         25   Technology or was it a new position?




                                                                       40

         10        Q      When did Mr. Bullock leave as you

         11   understand it?

         12        A      I don't recall.

         13        Q      Had it been quite some time before you

         14   assumed the position of chief of information or chief

         15   of staff of the Department of Information Technology?

          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      And that's a direct report relationship?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      Do you have folks that report to you?

         15        Q      But you don't report to him?

         16        A      Correct.

         17        Q      So you kind of are on the same level as the

         18   deputy secretary?

         19        A      Correct.

         20        Q      I want to move away from the background.

          4        Q      What part of Baltimore?

          5        A      I believe -- well, I know you come off

          6   of -- as soon as you come off of 295, you head left.  I

          7   don't know the street name in particular right now,

          8   but, yes, I'm familiar where it's located.

          9        Q      You're not based in Baltimore?  Your office

         10   isn't in Baltimore?

         11        A      We have offices in State Center.  The

         12   Department of Information Technology does have offices

         13   in State Center, but we are based primarily out of

         14   Crownsville.

         15        Q      And you sit in Crownsville?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      Do you know when the buildings at the State

         18   Center were built?

         19        A      I do not.

         20        Q      Do you know whether they are more than 20

         21   years old?

         22        A      I believe they are.

         23        Q      What about more than 30 years old?

         24        A      I don't know.

         25        Q      Would it surprise you that some are more




                                                                       43



          1   than 70 years old?

          2        A      No.

          3        Q      You mentioned that DOIT has offices at

          4   State Center, correct?

          5        A      Correct.

          6        Q      What departments of DOIT have offices at

          7   State Center?

          8        A      We have attorney generals that sit in DOIT

          9   office space at the State Center.  We have the TAM

         10   office, telecommunications access of Maryland, and some

         11   desktop support staff sit in the offices at State

         12   Center.

         13        Q      About how many employees of DOIT sit at

         14   State Center?

         15        A      Less than 20.

         16        Q      What does TAM do?

         17        A      They help with Maryland relay which is, you

         18   know, for individuals that are deaf or hard of hearing

         19   to be able to communicate and get the technology to be

         20   able to communicate.

         21        Q      What do these desktop support staff folks

         22   do?

         23        A      Make sure your computer is functioning.  If

         24   it breaks, they'll fix it, troubleshoot, those types of

         25   issues.

          1        Q      Do you know what buildings the folks from

          2   the Department of Information Technology sit in at

          3   State Center?

          4        A      I do not have the specific building name,

          5   no.

          6        Q      Are you familiar with the current

          7   conditions of the State Center buildings?

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'm going to object to this

          9   question and any questions along this line of

         10   questioning.  To put on record, the state has filed

         11   objections to topics 18 through 22 on Exhibit A of the

         12   notice of deposition and included is topic number 18,

         13   the conditions of the current workplace of DOIT

         14   employees including regarding complaints, regarding the

         15   physical plant and health issues presented by the

         16   current state of the physical plant of the buildings.

         17               I am objecting and instructing the witness

         18   not to answer on any questions about the current

         19   condition of State Center as I believe that is fairly

         20   encompassed within our objection to topic number 18.

         21               MR. BYRON:  I believe that these questions

         22   are directly relevant to the reasons for negotiating

         23   occupancy lease at the State Center complex.  I'm going

         24   to ask him along those lines and we can fight it out as

         25   to whether the topics or the questions and answers are




                                                                       45



          1   covered by the notice.

          2   BY MR. BYRON:

          3        Q      If you don't have information about

          4   anything I ask you, then fine.  We'll fight it out in

          5   court over it, but I'm going to continue to ask them

          6   and see where you're sort of prepared or not prepared

          7   today.

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  To be clear, I'm going to

          9   object and continue to instruct you not to answer

         10   questions along those particular lines, but we'll take

         11   it question by question as Mr. Byron has suggested.

         12               MR. BYRON:  Okay.

         13   BY MR. BYRON:

         14        Q      I'm going to ask them all so that I can

         15   have a record for the Court and get my answers to the

         16   questions that I think I'm entitled to get answers to.

         17   Okay?

         18        A      Okay.

         19        Q      Are you familiar with current conditions of

         20   the building at State Center?

         21               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question.

         22   I instruct the witness not to answer.

         23   BY MR. BYRON:

         24        Q      What do you understand the current

         25   conditions to be at State Center?

          1               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

          2   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

          3   BY MR. BYRON:

          4        Q      Let me ask that question.  What do you

          5   understand the current condition of the State Center

          6   buildings to be?

          7               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

          8   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

          9   BY MR. BYRON:

         10        Q      Are you aware of any structural issues with

         11   the State Center buildings?

         12               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

         13   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

         14   BY MR. BYRON:

         15        Q      What are they?

         16               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

         17   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

         18   BY MR. BYRON:

         19        Q      Are you aware that the exterior walls and

         20   envelopes to the buildings have deteriorated?

         21               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form and

         22   objection to that question and I instruct the witness

         23   not to answer.

         24   BY MR. BYRON:

         25        Q      Does moisture seep into the buildings?




                                                                       47



          1               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

          2   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

          3               MR. BYRON:  You're really going to make me

          4   move to compel on this and we're going to do this all

          5   over again?

          6               MR. ROSENFELD:  We have been consistent in

          7   our objections and anything related to the current

          8   status of the State Center buildings is not something

          9   that developer is entitled to.  If you would like to

         10   ask all of those questions, I'm going to object to all

         11   of those questions.

         12               MR. BYRON:  I'm going to keep asking.

         13   BY MR. BYRON:

         14        Q      Are you aware of any issues with mold at

         15   the State Center buildings?

         16               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

         17   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

         19        Q      Are you aware of any issues with asbestos

         20   at the State Center buildings?

          1   BY MR. BYRON:

          2        Q      Would you agree that the State Center

          3   buildings are not the ideal work environment for state

          4   employees?

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to that question

          6   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

          7   BY MR. BYRON:

          8        Q      Would you agree that the State Center

          9   buildings need to be renovated or replaced?

         11   and I instruct the witness not to answer.

         12               MR. BYRON:  I'm going to go back to 2010

         13   and ask the same questions and I think this -- maybe

         14   we'll overcome your objection.

         15   BY MR. BYRON:

         16        Q      Are you familiar with the condition -- are

         17   you familiar with what the conditions of the State

         18   Center buildings were in 2010?

         19        A      I am not.

         20        Q      Do you have any understanding about what

         21   those conditions of the State Center buildings were in

         22   2010?

         23        A      I do not.

         24        Q      Are you aware of any structural issues that

         25   existed with the State Center buildings in 2010?




                                                                       50



          1        A      I'm not aware.

          2        Q      So there could be structural issues that

          3   existed in 2010?  You just don't know?

          4        A      I'm not aware.

          5        Q      So you don't know?

          6        A      I don't know.

          7        Q      And do you know if the Department of

          8   Information Technology knows?

          9        A      The Department of Information Technology

         10   has no awareness or knowledge of the conditions.

         11        Q      What did you do to explore that question?

         12        A      I talked to the individuals.

         13               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'm going to object to that

         14   question because it doesn't appear on your topics.  So

         15   there's no reason why he would have.

         16               MR. BYRON:  There's a reason for the

         17   redevelopment of the State Center complex.  Obviously

         18   the existing State Center complex is not an ideal work

         19   environment or whatever it may be.  There's a reason

         20   that they went forward with negotiating occupancy

         21   leases for the State Center complex.  All of this is a

         22   predicate to that.  I believe that the witness should

         23   be prepared to testify about all this.  It's not within

         24   the scope of your objections.

         25               MR. ROSENFELD:  Point it out in your




                                                                       51



          1   topics.

          2               MR. BYRON:  Sure.  The negotiation and

          3   drafting of the occupancy leases.

          4               MR. ROSENFELD:  You asked a question about

          5   the condition of State Center in 2010.

          6               MR. BYRON:  Yes.

          7               MR. ROSENFELD:  How does that fit under the

          8   negotiation and drafting of the occupancy?

          9               MR. BYRON:  There's a reason that the

         10   occupancy leases are being negotiated for the State

         11   Center complex.  And part of that has to do with the

         12   condition at the State Center complex.  You want to

         13   take a very overly restrictive view of the topics, then

         14   fine.  We'll take it up with the judge.

         15               If you think all of these questions are

         16   outside of the scope of our notice, then please put an

         17   objection on the record.  I won't go through all the

         18   same questions with him, but, you know, I think that

         19   these are fairly within the scope of what we've

         20   noticed.  I think they're fair game for the purposes of

         21   this case and this deposition, but if you want to

         22   object to them and take a very restrictive view of what

         23   this case is about and how these occupancy leases came

         24   to be, then fine.  We'll take it up with the judge and

         25   we'll be back here in two weeks doing the same thing.

          1               MR. ROSENFELD:  I object to any questions

          2   regarding the physical condition of State Center in

          3   2010 as outside the scope of State Center, LLC's notice

          4   to the Department of Information Technology.  I would

          5   instruct the witness not to answer any questions along

          6   those lines.  And to the extent that Mr. Byron asks any

          7   more individual questions along those lines, I will

          8   state objections to those individual questions and

          9   instruct the witness not to answer.

         10   BY MR. BYRON:

         11        Q      Does the Department of Information

         12   Technology maintain the information technology systems

         13   at State Center?

         14        A      The Department of Information Technology

         15   maintains some of the systems at State Center.

         16        Q      What systems does it maintain?

         17        A      Ones that would be -- primarily be focused

         18   on who we service.  We -- the Department of Information

         19   Technology does not service all state agencies, IT or

         20   information technology needs.

         21        Q      Which agencies does it service in 2010?

         22        A      I could not tell you.

         23        Q      Did it service the Department of General

         24   Services?

         25        A      In 2010, I couldn't tell you.




                                                                       53



          1        Q      Did it service the Department of Health and

          2   Mental Hygiene?

          3        A      In 2010, I couldn't tell you.

          4        Q      Did it service the Department of Planning

          5   in 2010?

          6        A      2010, I couldn't tell you.

          7        Q      Did it service the Maryland Department of

          8   Transportation in 2010?

          9        A      No.

         10        Q      Did not?

         11        A      No.

         12        Q      Can you tell me anyone that it serviced in

         13   the State Center complex in 2010?

         14        A      I cannot.

         15        Q      Can you tell me what IT systems DOIT

         16   supports at the State Center?

         17        A      Today?

         18        Q      Sure.

         19        A      The agency -- the Department of Information

         20   Technology supports in various capacities the

         21   Department of Planning, some desktop support for the

         22   Department of General Services, network support for the

         23   Department of Health, planning as well as general

         24   services for the network that they access services on.

         25   That's the extent of my understanding.




                                                                       54



          1        Q      So you testified broadly about desktop

          2   support and general services for the network.  Does

          3   that include phone systems?

          4        A      It does include portions of the phone

          5   systems.  There are -- there is a voice over IP or

          6   voice over Internet protocol telephone system that DOIT

          7   is responsible for.  There are older legacy phone

          8   systems that there's varying responsibilities depending

          9   on the agencies all across the entire state.

         10        Q      So it supports a portion of the phone

         11   systems at State Center?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Does it support the physical computers?

         14        A      Some.

         15        Q      Some of them?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      What do you mean by that?

         18        A      Certain agencies have their own information

         19   technology offices.  One that jumps to mind is the

         20   Department of Health.  There are smaller agencies such

         21   as planning where DOIT provides that type of support.

         22        Q      Does that include both the hardware and

         23   software on those computers?

         24        A      It varies.

         25        Q      It varies?




                                                                       55



          1        A      Literally from desktop to desktop.  There

          2   may be an older system that was purchased years ago by,

          3   for example, the Department of Planning that DOIT did

          4   not purchase.  Therefore, it is not DOIT's

          5   responsibility to maintain that desktop.

          6        Q      But anything that DOIT purchased from a

          7   hardware perspective or software perspective it

          8   supports?

          9        A      Correct.

         10        Q      And what percentage would you say roughly

         11   would be the percentage of computer hardware systems

         12   that it supports?

         13        A      I'm not prepared to answer that.

         14        Q      Would it be more than half?

         15        A      It varies.  I don't know.

         16        Q      What about the software?  Do you not know?

         17        A      That is the same type of variation.  I

         18   don't know.

         19        Q      Does DOIT provide support for any of the

         20   servers at State Center?

         21        A      It's my understanding it does not.

         22        Q      What about the financial systems they're

         23   using in the agencies at State Center?

         24        A      The Department of Information Technology

         25   has joint responsibility with the comptroller's office




                                                                       56



          1   for certain financial systems.  So to that extent, it's

          2   a shared responsibility between the Department of

          3   Information Technology and the state comptroller.

          4        Q      How is that responsibility broken down?

          5        A      There is an MOU in place between the two

          6   agencies.  DOIT has personnel contracting staff to

          7   support the technology aspects of the system.  The

          8   comptroller is essentially the owner of the system and

          9   we cannot make any changes to the system without the

         10   permission of the comptroller.

         11        Q      Are there any other shared systems that

         12   DOIT manages or supports at State Center?

         13        A      None that come to mind.

         14        Q      Does DOIT support the Internet at State

         15   Center?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      What does that consist of?

         18        A      It consists of -- it is network Maryland.

         19   DOIT is the responsible party for network Maryland

         20   which agencies use to connect to the Internet.

         21        Q      Does that include maintaining the modems?

         22        A      Routers, switches, fiberoptic cables,

         23   ethernet cables.

         24        Q      So the whole suite of Internet stuff?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       57



          1        Q      Are there any other information technology

          2   systems that come to mind that DOIT helps support at

          3   State Center?

          4        A      There may be applications within specific

          5   agencies that DOIT offers a level of support.

          6        Q      What's the current state of the information

          7   technology infrastructure at the State Center?

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

          9               But you can answer to the extent you

         10   understand the question.

         11               THE WITNESS:  I believe they're operational

         12   and functioning as necessary to support the duties of

         13   the agency.

         14   BY MR. BYRON:

         15        Q      Would you consider any of it outdated?

         16        A      No.

         17        Q      It's all state of the art?

         18               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         19               But you can answer.

         20               THE WITNESS:  I know network Maryland is

         21   state of the art.

         22   BY MR. BYRON:

         23        Q      Would you consider anything that needs to

         24   be replaced?

         25        A      Not that I'm aware of.




                                                                       58



          1        Q      Do you believe that any of these need to be

          2   upgraded at all?

          3        A      Not that I'm aware of.

          4        Q      Do you believe there would be any benefits

          5   in improving the information technology infrastructure

          6   at State Center?

          7        A      Not that I'm aware of.

          8        Q      Any enhanced Internet speed?

          9        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         10        Q      Increased data security?

         11        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         12        Q      Improving the structured cable system at

         13   State Center?

         14        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         15        Q      You think it's all state of the art?

         16        A      I think network Maryland is state of the

         17   art and they are on network Maryland.

         18        Q      But all the cables in the building are all

         19   state in the art and all new?

         20               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the form.

         21               But you can answer.

         22               THE WITNESS:  As far as I'm aware.

         23   BY MR. BYRON:

         24        Q      So there would be no benefit improving any

         25   of the IT infrastructure at State Center?




                                                                       59



          1        A      Not that I'm aware of.

          2        Q      Do you know whether the information

          3   technology servers and data rooms for state agencies

          4   that are currently at the State Center are located in a

          5   single server room or multiple individual server rooms?

          6        A      I do not know the present location of

          7   those.

          8        Q      What about in 2010?

          9        A      It was my understanding that they -- the

         10   purpose that the information -- Department of

         11   Information Technology had in pursuing space at State

         12   Center was to help agencies consolidate their

         13   respective centers, data centers into one co-located

         14   data center that would be managed by the Department of

         15   Information Technology.

         16        Q      DOIT's understanding is that in 2010 the --

         17   certain of the departments and agencies at State Center

         18   had independent or separate server rooms?

         19        A      Correct.

         20        Q      Would that include the Department of Health

         21   and Mental Hygiene?

         22        A      Correct.

         23        Q      And that's now the Department of Health,

         24   right?

         25        A      Correct.




                                                                       60



          1        Q      Would that include the Department of

          2   Transportation?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      And also the Maryland Transit Authority?

          5        A      Correct.

          6        Q      Would that include the Department of

          7   Planning?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      Do the individual server and data rooms

         10   need to have a cooling system?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      Is that done through the air-conditioning

         13   system?

         14        A      There's HVAC, yes.

         15        Q      Are you aware that the air-conditioning

         16   system at four buildings at State Center had to undergo

         17   emergency repairs in May of 2019?

         18               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form and

         19   objection to that question.

         20               You can answer to the extent you know the

         21   answer.

         22               THE WITNESS:  I'm not aware.

         23   BY MR. BYRON:

         24        Q      If the air-conditioning went out in May of

         25   2009, would that impact the data and server rooms?




                                                                       61



          1        A      It may impact the data and server rooms of

          2   those agencies.

          3        Q      What could be the problems with not having

          4   air-conditioning?

          5        A      Without air-conditioning, you could have --

          6   it would vary.  I don't know the particulars, but

          7   things would get hot.

          8        Q      And possibly have an adverse impact on the

          9   servers?

         10        A      I believe that's possible.

         11        Q      So it's problematic if the air-conditioning

         12   goes out?

         13        A      It's possible.

         14        Q      It could be?

         15        A      It could be.

         16        Q      Do you know what sort of fire protection

         17   systems exist for the server rooms and data rooms at

         18   the State Center?

         19        A      I do not.

         20        Q      Are you familiar with a pre-action fire

         21   sprinkler system?

         22        A      I've heard the term, yes.

         23        Q      What do you understand it to mean?

         24        A      Just that -- that it would be preventative

         25   and they would turn on and stop any outbreak of fire.




                                                                       62



          1        Q      Do you know if there's a benefit in using a

          2   pre-action system for fire protection in data and

          3   server rooms?

          4               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the question.

          5               But you can answer.

          6               THE WITNESS:  I'm not aware.

          7   BY MR. BYRON:

          8        Q      Do you know if the server and data rooms at

          9   State Center have a pre-action fire protection system?

         10        A      I do not.

         11        Q      Are you familiar with a gaseous suppression

         12   system for fire protection?

         13        A      I'm not.

         14        Q      So is it fair to say you don't know if the

         15   data and server rooms at State Center have a gaseous

         16   suppression fire protection system?

         17               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to this question.

         18               But you can answer.

         19               THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't have visibility

         20   into the agency's server rooms.

         21   BY MR. BYRON:

         22        Q      Do you know whether the state's insurance

         23   requires the state to have either a pre-action

         24   sprinkler system or a gaseous protection system for its

         25   data and server rooms?




                                                                       63

          5        Q      Do you know what security systems the

          6   server and data rooms have at the State Center complex?

          2        Q      Do you know if the data and server rooms at

          3   State Center have backup power systems?

          4        A      I am not aware.

          5        Q      Is it fair to say you're not really aware

          6   of what the state of the current data rooms and server

          7   rooms are at State Center?

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection along the --

          9   objection along the same lines as previous line of

         10   objection that this goes to the -- sorry.  Could you

         11   repeat the question?

         12               MR. BYRON:  Sure.

         15   aware of what the current state of the data rooms and

         16   server rooms are at State Center?

         17               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the extent --

         18   I would instruct the witness not to answer to the

         19   extent that this implicates any of the topics that we

         20   have objected to including the conditions of the

         21   workplace assessment of habitability and current state

         22   of the physical plant or the buildings.

         23               But you may answer to the extent that you

         24   can answer independent of that information.

         25               THE WITNESS:  Repeat it again.

          1   BY MR. BYRON:

          2        Q      Sure.  Is it fair to say that you're not

          3   really aware of what the current state of the data

          4   rooms and server rooms are at State Center?

          5        A      Yes.

          6        Q      That's fair?

          7        A      Yes.  The agencies that are responsible for

          8   their data centers would know best.

          9        Q      Is it -- would know best, but do you know

         10   anything about them?

         11        A      No.

         12        Q      Is it fair to say that you are not sitting

         13   here today aware of what the state of the data rooms

         14   and server rooms at State Center was in 2010?

         15        A      Correct, I am not aware of the conditions.

         16        Q      I want to talk about the State Center

         17   project and maybe we'll move away from objectionable

         18   topics into something that's not objectionable.  And

         19   maybe this will all make sense for Jordan in a second

         20   as to why I asked a lot of those questions.

         21               MR. ROSENFELD:  I think it makes sense now,

         22   but go on.

         23   BY MR. BYRON:

         24        Q      Are you familiar with the State Center

         25   project?




                                                                       66



          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      When did you become aware of the State

          3   Center project?

          4        A      I was aware of the State Center project, my

          5   goodness, probably 2017.

          6        Q      While you were in the governor's office?

          7        A      Correct.

          8        Q      What were you told about the State Center

          9   project?

         10               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection only to the

         11   extent that that would implicate any attorney-client

         12   communication -- well, objection based on the broadness

         13   of the question to the extent that it implicates any

         14   attorney-client communications.  I would instruct the

         15   witness not to answer anything he was told by an

         16   attorney in the course of litigation.

         17   BY MR. BYRON:

         18        Q      Let me ask a different question.  How did

         19   you become aware of the State Center project in 2017?

         20        A      News reports.

         21        Q      What news reports?

         22        A      Just regarding, you know, lawsuits.

         23        Q      You became aware of this lawsuit?

         24        A      I believe so.

         25        Q      What do you understand the State Center




                                                                       67



          1   project to be?

          2        A      To my understanding that in -- dating back

          3   to 2010, 2009/2010, there was a desire by the past

          4   administration to help redevelop State Center or to

          5   redevelop State Center and the Department of General

          6   Services worked with the developer or worked to solicit

          7   proposals and eventually worked with the developer on

          8   that plan and things progressed on, you know, fast

          9   forward to around that 2017 time and things got stopped

         10   and there was a lawsuit and here we are.

         11        Q      Are you aware of any benefits of the State

         12   Center project to the state agencies that are housed at

         13   State Center?

         14               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection.  Objection.

         15               But you can answer.

         16               Objection.

         17               But you can answer to the extent you

         18   understand the question.

         19               THE WITNESS:  Could you repeat it again?

         20   BY MR. BYRON:

         21        Q      Sure.  Are you aware of any benefits of the

         22   State Center project to the state agencies that are

         23   housed at State Center?

         24        A      I am aware of I guess promoted benefits.  I

         25   don't know that I would call them benefits because I




                                                                       68



          1   don't know that they're a benefit or not.  I know what

          2   the -- I guess the promise was to be.

          3        Q      What are those promoted benefits as you

          4   call them?

          5        A      Well, I think it's my understanding that

          6   with any new construction or any new building or any

          7   redeveloped building that there would be those inherent

          8   benefits of having something --

          9        Q      So new buildings?

         10        A      -- more modern.

         11        Q      New buildings is one of the benefits?

         12        A      Well, something that's new, yes.  It could

         13   be a new building.  It could be a renovated building.

         14   It could be --

         15        Q      Well, that would fix any issues associated

         16   with the current State Center buildings?

         17               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the form of

         18   the question, the characterization.

         19               But you may answer it.

         20               THE WITNESS:  Potentially.

         21   BY MR. BYRON:

         22        Q      Do you understand it would be offering

         23   build to suit space for the state agencies that would

         24   be housed at State Center?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       69



          1        Q      And there are benefits to that, correct?

          2               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the form.

          3               But you may answer it.

          4               THE WITNESS:  Possibly.

          5   BY MR. BYRON:

          6        Q      What are some of the possible benefits?

          7        A      Again, newer space.

          8        Q      No other benefits that you can think of?

          9        A      Speculation.

         10        Q      DOIT was one of the agencies that was

         11   involved in this, wasn't it?

         12        A      DOIT was an agency that needed data center

         13   space, that would have preferred to have consolidated

         14   data center space for state agencies, yes.

         15        Q      It also has employees there, correct?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      And you can't name a single benefit of the

         18   State Center project of DOIT employees that are housed

         19   at State Center?

         20               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

         21   characterization.

         22               You may answer.

         23               THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't be aware of the

         24   specific benefits that were promoted for the State

         25   Center redevelopment and how those were articulated to




                                                                       70



          1   DOIT at that time.

          2   BY MR. BYRON:

          3        Q      So you can't sitting here today articulate

          4   a single benefit to DOIT by the State Center project?

          5        A      I could articulate the consolidated data

          6   center at the redeveloped State Center complex.  DOIT

          7   saw that as a benefit.

          8        Q      What about for the employees that are

          9   housed there, can you articulate a single benefit to

         10   the employees of the State Center project aside from

         11   the consolidated data center which we'll talk about in

         12   a second?

         13        A      Again, potentially a new office space for

         14   them to work.

         15        Q      Are you aware of any benefits of adding new

         16   amenities to the State Center complex?

         17        A      I have seen or I've seen documents that --

         18   that talk about potential options as you would build

         19   out a new facility.  And some of those benefits were

         20   laid out about things that people in charge or Greg

         21   Urban at the time they want to think about in terms of,

         22   you know, coffee station or a, you know, kitchenette

         23   area for employees.

         24        Q      So potentially new coffee stations and new

         25   kitchenette areas?




                                                                       71



          1        A      Potentially.

          2        Q      And that would be a benefit to the new

          3   employees?

          4        A      Potentially.

          5        Q      Any other benefits to the DOIT employees

          6   that it could potentially have?

          7        A      I mean, those are the ones that I've seen

          8   in the documentation.

          9        Q      You've seen nothing else?

         10        A      I've seen that there was a desire to be

         11   lead certified green, have a more efficient building,

         12   energy efficient building, and a consolidated data

         13   center with, you know, the savings that come with that.

         14        Q      That would be a cost savings if it had a

         15   lead certified building?

         16               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

         17   characterization.

         18               THE WITNESS:  There would be a cost savings

         19   at our consolidated data center.  I can't speak to the

         20   power requirements.

         21   BY MR. BYRON:

         22        Q      Sure.  For the data center, it would be

         23   more energy efficient and save the government money?

         24        A      That would be the plan.

         25        Q      I want to talk about the benefit of




                                                                       72



          1   consolidation.  So that is a recognized benefit by DOIT

          2   of the State Center project, correct?

          3               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

          4   characterization.

          5               But you may answer.

          6               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          7               MR. BYRON:  I'm going go ahead and mark an

          8   exhibit.  This will be Exhibit 2.

          9               (Carroll Exhibit 2 was marked for purposes

         10   of identification.)

         11   BY MR. BYRON:

         12        Q      Go ahead and take a minute to review it and

         13   when you're ready, let me know.

         14        A      (Reviewing document.)

         15               Okay.

         16        Q      Exhibit 2 is an email chain from June 2010

         17   and July 2010.

         18               Do you see that?

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      I want to focus on the email from Sandy

         21   Mendler which is dated June 25th, 2010.

         22               Do you see that email?

         23        A      I do.

         24        Q      Do you know who Sandy Mendler is?

         25        A      Only based on the correspondence.  I don't




                                                                       73



          1   know her, but I know who she is.  She's been

          2   corresponding with various folks, Greg Urban primarily

          3   regarding the agency's needs.

          4        Q      Do you know where Ms. Mendler works or

          5   worked at this time?

          6        A      Mithun.

          7        Q      Do you know what Mithun is?

          8        A      My guess is they help build out spaces, an

          9   architect.

         10        Q      So Ms. Mendler sends her email to a number

         11   of individuals including individuals from the State of

         12   Maryland, correct?

         13        A      Correct.

         14        Q      She sends it to Greg Urban.

         15               Do you see that?

         16        A      I do.

         17        Q      Who is Greg Urban?

         18        A      Greg Urban at the time was the

         19   infrastructure chief that would have been responsible

         20   for understanding the needs for the consolidated data

         21   center or server room.

         22        Q      She also sends it to an individual by the

         23   name Stacia Cropper.

         24               Do you see that?

         25        A      I do.




                                                                       74



          1        Q      Who is Stacia Cropper?

          2        A      I do not know.

          3        Q      She has it appears to be a doit.state.mdus

          4   domain name.

          5               Do you see that?

          6        A      I do.

          7        Q      Do you know whether she worked for the

          8   Department of Information Technology?

          9        A      Only based on her email address.

         10        Q      But you don't know who she is?

         11        A      I don't know who she is.

         12        Q      The title of Ms. Mendler's email is

         13   SCITEMTG follow-up.

         14               Do you see that?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      I want you to look at the first bullet of

         17   Ms. Mendler's email.  Are you with me?

         18        A      Um-hmm.

         19        Q      She says:  "I would like to share a bit of

         20   the thinking about the single primary server room

         21   concept for people that were not in the meeting."

         22               Did I read that correctly?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      What is she talking about the single

         25   primary server room concept?




                                                                       75



          1        A      The consolidated data center, so the

          2   agencies that were listed, planning, transportation,

          3   MTA specifically, Health and Mental Hygiene, rolling

          4   all of those into a consolidated data center.

          5        Q      She goes on to say:  "DOIT has been in

          6   favor of this idea for some time."

          7               Did I read that correctly?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      So DOIT was in favor of having a single

         10   consolidated server room at the State Center, correct?

         11        A      Correct.

         12        Q      She then says:  "It enables much greater

         13   efficiency in terms of space utilization, staffing,

         14   quality of service, and supports our energy efficiency

         15   goals too."

         16               Did I read that correctly?

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      Is this why DOIT was in favor of a

         19   consolidated server room?

         20        A      Yes.

         21        Q      For efficiency in the first sub-bullet

         22   under number one, she says:  "Single server room is

         23   more space efficient because the space required for

         24   possible future growth can be pulled together rather

         25   than added to each space.  The rack layouts are also




                                                                       76



          1   more efficient in one larger room."

          2               Did I read that correctly?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      Did DOIT agree with this?

          5        A      Yes.

          6        Q      For staffing, she says:  "Staffing is more

          7   efficient because travel between facilities is

          8   eliminated."

          9               Did I read that correctly?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      What do you take that to mean travel

         12   between facilities is more efficient?

         13        A      State employees potentially are able to do

         14   their work in one location without having to travel to

         15   multiple locations.

         16        Q      Did DOIT agree that having a single server

         17   room would make staffing more efficient?

         18        A      DOIT agrees with that.  DOIT always agrees

         19   with that.

         20        Q      And then in the next sub-bullet, she talks

         21   about quality of service.

         22               Do you see that?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      She says:  "Quality of service is more

         25   consistent for all agencies as opposed to now where




                                                                       77



          1   smaller agencies cannot afford to create high quality

          2   server room environments."

          3               Do you see that?

          4        A      I do.

          5        Q      Did I read it correctly?

          6        A      Yes.

          7        Q      Did DOIT agree with this?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      So DOIT agreed that a single server room

         10   would improve quality of service?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      Then she describes in the remaining

         13   sub-bullets some energy efficiency benefits.

         14               Do you see those?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      What are those benefits just generally that

         17   she's describing?

         18        A      That we can reclaim or we can include heat

         19   reclaim from the server room more efficiently.  Is that

         20   what you're referring to?

         21        Q      Yes.  I think she talks about -- yeah.  Go

         22   on.  What does that mean?

         23        A      Again, I think when you have -- when you

         24   have server rooms that are -- you have one server room

         25   versus multiple server rooms, you can take that energy




                                                                       78



          1   and reutilize it.  It's all coming from one space.

          2   It's just efficiency.

          3        Q      And she also describes some efficiencies

          4   created by having a single backup power location?

          5        A      Um-hmm.

          6        Q      What are some of those efficiencies?

          7        A      Potentially a single generator or

          8   generators focused on one room versus multiple

          9   locations.

         10        Q      Did DOIT agree that having a single server

         11   room would create energy efficiency benefits for State

         12   Center?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      Do you know what an information technology

         15   cabling system is?

         16        A      I believe it's just cabling.

         17        Q      What do you mean by just cabling?

         18        A      It could be a fiberoptic.  It could be

         19   ethernet.  You would need a space to be able to run

         20   that cable and do it efficiently to get to wherever you

         21   need to get to, a room or a particular floor.

         22        Q      Is one of the benefits of a State Center

         23   project that would install a new structured cabling

         24   system for the first phases?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       79



          1        Q      I'm going to go ahead and hand you another

          2   exhibit to be marked as Exhibit 3.

          3               (Carroll Exhibit 3 was marked for purposes

          4   of identification.)

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  Do you have copies?

          6               MR. BYRON:  I'm sorry.

          7               MR. ROSENFELD:  That's okay.

          8   BY MR. BYRON:

          9        Q      If you take a minute to look that over.

         10   I'm not going to ask you detailed questions about all

         11   of it, but just familiarize yourself with it and I'll

         12   point you to some sections and we can give you some

         13   more time if you need to look at the specific sections

         14   that I point to.  Okay?

         15        A      Sure.

         16        Q      Just let me know when you're ready.

         17        A      Okay.

         18               (Reviewing document.)

         19               Okay.

         20        Q      So Exhibit 3 is a booklet entitled:

         21   Concept Phase.

         22               Do you see that?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      It is dated July 2nd, 2010.

         25               Do you see that?




                                                                       80



          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      And it has the logos there of the State of

          3   Maryland, Mithun design collective and a C project.

          4               Do you see that?

          5        A      Yes.

          6        Q      Do you understand this to be a joint

          7   booklet prepared by Mithun and design collective for

          8   the State of Maryland and the State Center project?

          9        A      Yes.

         10        Q      Have you seen this document before?

         11        A      No.

         12        Q      This book -- you've just had a chance to

         13   review it -- is about the State Center project, though,

         14   correct?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      Will you go ahead and turn to page 48 for

         17   me in the booklet and there's little Bates numbers

         18   here.  It's DEE underscore 00038468.

         19        A      Okay.

         20        Q      Before we talk about what's on page 48, if

         21   you just flip back to 45 which is the cover page of

         22   this section.  What we're about to discuss is in a

         23   section called mechanical electrical plumbing (MEP)

         24   building systems.

         25               Do you see that?




                                                                       81



          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      So go back to page 48 of the booklet there.

          3   One of the MEP systems that are discussed in the

          4   booklet here are the telecommunications systems.

          5               Do you see that?

          6        A      Yes.

          7        Q      And that is in a section that's numbered

          8   section 6.

          9               Do you see that?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      And this -- if you need a second to review

         12   this to answer the question, please let me know, but

         13   this is talking about the telecommunications that will

         14   be part -- telecommunications systems that will be part

         15   of the State Center project, correct?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      And it says:  "The structured cabling

         18   system for parcels G and I2 will support both current

         19   and future voice applications, data communications,

         20   video, and building management system applications."

         21               Do you see that?

         22        A      Yes.

         23        Q      Did I read that correctly?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      "Comprised of backbone fiberoptic and




                                                                       82



          1   copper cabling from the facility entrance facility to

          2   floor by floor rooms supporting the connections for

          3   horizontal cabling to the end users.  The physical

          4   infrastructure of the system will be flexible and

          5   capable of incorporating new facilities and

          6   technologies as they become desired."

          7               Did I read that correctly?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      So a benefit of the State Center project as

         10   you mentioned was to install a new structured cabling

         11   system, correct?

         12               MR. ROSENFELD:  Object to characterization.

         13               But you can answer.

         14               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         15   BY MR. BYRON:

         16        Q      And that cabling system would be a system

         17   that could support new technology, correct?

         18        A      Essentially.

         19        Q      According to this, it would be a system

         20   that could support new technology, correct?

         21        A      That's what it says, yes.

         22        Q      You disagree with that?

         23        A      I just don't know.  Circumstances could

         24   change.  The technology could far exceed it in a couple

         25   of years.




                                                                       83



          1        Q      But that was the idea that DOIT had was the

          2   cabling system could support new technology?

          3        A      I see that that is an idea that the

          4   developer had and the department would potentially

          5   benefit.

          6        Q      Where do you see that's the developer's

          7   idea?

          8        A      I don't see the Department of Information

          9   Technology.

         10        Q      You see the State of Maryland's brand,

         11   don't you, at the front of the book?

         12        A      I see the State of Maryland, yes.

         13        Q      Do you see the developer's brand?

         14        A      I do.

         15        Q      Where?

         16        A      I see Mithun, the architect, and the

         17   developer.  Who is the State Center project?

         18        Q      So you don't see the developer's brand, do

         19   you?

         20        A      No, I don't see their brand.

         21        Q      You don't know one way or the other sitting

         22   here today as DOIT's representative on the server room

         23   occupancy lease whether there would be a new cabling

         24   system in the building?

         25        A      No.  I know there would be a new cabling




                                                                       84



          1   system.

          2        Q      You don't know whether one of the benefits

          3   of that new cabling system was going to support new

          4   technologies?

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

          6   speculative nature of this question.

          7               But you can answer to the extent that you

          8   can answer.

          9               THE WITNESS:  I just say potentially.

         10   BY MR. BYRON:

         11        Q      That was the idea that DOIT had?

         12        A      I think the primary idea that DOIT had was

         13   that we need a new consolidated data center and that's

         14   that.

         15        Q      So DOIT would install cables that couldn't

         16   support new technologies?

         17        A      I don't know that DOIT would do that.  I

         18   think DOIT would install technologies that are present

         19   at the time that are the best at the time.

         20        Q      And that they, DOIT thought could

         21   potentially support new technology, correct?

         22        A      Potentially.

         23        Q      But that's the idea, right?

         24               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         25               But you can answer.

          1               THE WITNESS:  The hope.

          2   BY MR. BYRON:

          3        Q      And the cabling system that had been

          4   envisioned for the State Center project could also add

          5   more capacity if additional agencies wanted to use it,

          6   correct?

          7               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

          8               But you can answer.

          9               THE WITNESS:  Potentially, yes.

         10   BY MR. BYRON:

         11        Q      Is one of the benefits of the State Center

         12   project that would install new air-conditioning

         13   systems?

         14               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         15               But you can answer.

         16               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         17   BY MR. BYRON:

         18        Q      Do you know whether one of those

         19   air-conditioning systems would be dedicated to the

         20   centralized data and server room?

         21        A      I don't know whether it's dedicated.  I do

         22   recall that they had special needs for cooling.  I

         23   couldn't tell you whether that is a specific system

         24   dedicated only to the server room.

         25        Q      If you flip to page 47 for me.  And this is




                                                                       86



          1   actually a carryover from 46.  There's a section called

          2   HVAC design under number 2.

          3               Do you see that?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      It talks about the -- in the first full

          6   paragraph, it talks about the HVAC systems.

          7               Do you see that?

          8        A      I do.

          9        Q      Take a chance to just review that and I'm

         10   going to ask you about the last sentence.

         11        A      Okay.

         12               (Reviewing document.)

         13               Okay.

         14        Q      The last sentence says:  "HVAC systems for

         15   the data centers will be conventional DXCR AC units

         16   with N plus one equipment redundancy."

         17               Do you see that?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      Does this imply that there would be

         20   independent or separate HVAC systems for the data room?

         21        A      It could be implied.

         22        Q      Do you know one way or the other?

         23        A      No.

         24        Q      Did you explore?  Did you do anything to

         25   explore whether that was true as to the intent for the




                                                                       87



          1   occupancy lease in the new data room that DOIT was

          2   going to be installing at the State Center complex?

          3               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

          4               You can answer to the extent you understand

          5   the question.

          6               THE WITNESS:  Sure.  I knew there were

          7   needs for HVAC in the server room.  I could not speak

          8   to the particulars of how that would be designed or set

          9   up.

         10               (Carroll Exhibit 4 was marked for purposes

         11   of identification.)

         12   BY MR. BYRON:

         13        Q      The court reporter has handed you a

         14   document that has been marked as Exhibit 4 for today's

         15   deposition.  Exhibit 4 is an email chain entitled:  SC

         16   IT and that includes emails from September 2010,

         17   correct?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      The top email is from Greg Urban.

         20               Do you see that?

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      And Greg Urban again was with the

         23   Department of Information Technology at this time,

         24   correct?

         25        A      Correct.




                                                                       88



          1        Q      In the email, Mr. Urban says:  "Attached

          2   are the preliminary specifications based on the

          3   questions posed by John in an earlier email."

          4               Do you see that?

          5        A      Um-hmm.  Yes.

          6        Q      He then attaches a Word document that he

          7   has titled State Center consolidated computer room

          8   design questions.doc.

          9               Do you see that?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      I want to go ahead and turn to the

         12   attachment.  The attachment is what Mr. Urban is saying

         13   are the design features of the consolidated server

         14   room, correct?

         15               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

         16   characterization there given the first sentence that

         17   you read.

         18               But you can answer.

         19               THE WITNESS:  Will you repeat the question,

         20   please?

         21               MR. BYRON:  I think you missed that answer.

         22   I think he said yes before the objection.

         23               THE COURT REPORTER:  Sorry.  I didn't hear

         24   it.

         25   




                                                                       89



          1   BY MR. BYRON:

          2        Q      The attachment is what Mr. Urban is saying

          3   are the design features -- or what Mr. Urban is saying

          4   will be the design features of the consolidated data

          5   room?

          6               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection, same objection.

          7               But you can answer.

          8               THE WITNESS:  Well, I see that it says

          9   State Center consolidated computer room design

         10   questions as the name of the attachment.

         11   BY MR. BYRON:

         12        Q      But he's saying attached are the

         13   preliminary specifications based on the questions posed

         14   by John in an earlier email, correct?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      So this is what Mr. Urban is saying are the

         17   specifications for the data room, correct?

         18               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         19               But you may answer.

         20               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         21   BY MR. BYRON:

         22        Q      If you turn to the attachment in .4, Mr.

         23   Urban is saying the space will require a special HVAC

         24   system, correct?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                       90



          1        Q      So this is again indicating that the data

          2   room is going to have its own HVAC system, correct?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      And that's one of the benefits of this

          5   project is to have a new independent HVAC system for

          6   the data room, correct?

          7        A      It says it's one of the requirements.

          8        Q      Does DOIT view that as a benefit?

          9        A      I think it's a requirement.  I don't think

         10   it's an option.

         11        Q      Does DOIT view that as a benefit?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Is one of the benefits of the State Center

         14   project that they will install new fire protection

         15   systems for the server rooms?

         16               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the form.

         17               But you may answer the question.

         18               I'd like a continuing objection to the line

         19   of questions about what the State Center project will

         20   do given where we are.

         21               But you may answer the question.

         22               MR. BYRON:  I think I said would or did I

         23   say will?

          1   project that it would install new fire protection

          2   server -- is one of the benefits of the State Center

          3   project that it would install new fire protection

          4   systems for the server rooms?  And if I've said will in

          5   the past, I meant would or -- so I apologize if there

          6   was confusion.

          7               MR. ROSENFELD:  I object anyway.

          8               But you may answer.

          9               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         10   BY MR. BYRON:

         11        Q      That is one of the benefits?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Do you know whether those systems would be

         14   either a pre-action system or a gaseous pressure

         15   system?

         16        A      I do not.

         17        Q      And if you go ahead and pick up Exhibit 3

         18   again.  Turn to page 48.

         19        A      Okay.

         20        Q      On page 48, there's a section called fire

         21   protection systems.

         22               Do you see that?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      In that section, it says:  "Data centers

         25   will be provided with either a pre-action system or a




                                                                       92

          2   requirements."

          3               Do you see that?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      Does this indicate that there would be a

          6   pre-action system or a gaseous suppression system as

          7   the fire protection system for the data center?

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         11   BY MR. BYRON:

         12        Q      And does this indicate that that was an

         13   insurance requirement --

         11   would be?

         12        A      I believe there was a section regarding

         13   access or potentially biometric.

         14        Q      Is one of the benefits of the State Center

         21        Q      So is it fair to say that the State Center

         22   project had a number of benefits from an information

         23   technology perspective?

         24               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         25               But you may answer.




                                                                       94



          1               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          2               MR. BYRON:  Let's go ahead and take a

          3   break.

          4               (There was a brief recess taken.)

          5   BY MR. BYRON:

          6        Q      I want to shift gears now, Mr. Carroll, and

          7   talk about the lease that was negotiated for the

          8   Department of Information Technology for the State

          9   Center project.  Okay?

         10        A      Okay.

         11        Q      Are you aware that the state negotiated a

         12   lease for DOIT with the developer for the State Center

         13   project in 2010?

         14        A      Yes.

         15        Q      Were you involved in negotiating the lease

         16   for DOIT?

         17        A      I was not.

         18        Q      Do you know who from DOIT was involved in

         19   negotiating the lease for DOIT?

         20        A      Which lease are you referring to?

         21        Q      The occupancy lease that was negotiated for

         22   parcel G at the State Center project.

         23        A      Got you.  Greg Urban.

         24        Q      Was anyone else from DOIT involved in

         25   negotiating that lease?




                                                                       95



          1        A      Not that I'm aware.

          2        Q      Remind me what was Mr. Urban's role at that

          3   time.

          4        A      At that time, Greg Urban would have been

          5   the infrastructure chief.

          6        Q      And what does the infrastructure chief do?

          7        A      Manages the server storage network,

          8   oversees desktop support as well.

          9        Q      Does the infrastructure chief generally

         10   negotiate leases on behalf of DOIT?

         11        A      The infrastructure chief is usually the

         12   expert on the needs and requirements of the agency.

         13   So, yes.

         14        Q      Usually involved in the lease negotiation

         15   process?

         16        A      There's not a lot of moving for the agency.

         17        Q      Are there any -- Mr. Harp's here, as I

         18   understand it, one of the assistant attorney generals

         19   assigned to DOIT as an agency.  Are there any assistant

         20   attorney generals involved at DOIT that are generally

         21   involved in negotiating leases?

         22        A      There are assistant attorney generals at

         23   the agency.  I would imagine, yes, they're involved.

         24        Q      Were any of them involved in negotiating

         25   the occupancy lease for the State Center project?




                                                                       96



          1        A      Not that I've seen in any of the documents

          2   that I've seen.

          3        Q      So you're not aware that any of the DOIT

          4   assistant attorney generals were involved in

          5   negotiating that lease?

          6        A      Correct.

          7        Q      Aside from Mr. Urban, are you aware of

          8   anyone else at DOIT who was involved in negotiating the

          9   occupancy lease for DOIT?

         10        A      I am not.

         11        Q      Were other agencies involved with the

         12   negotiations for the DOIT occupancy lease?

         13        A      The Department of General Services.

         14        Q      Any other agencies?

         15        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         16        Q      What was the Department of Information

         17   Technology's role in negotiating the occupancy lease

         18   for the State Center project?

         19        A      The Department of Information Technology

         20   needed to communicate the needs for the space with the

         21   Department of General Services as well as the

         22   developer.

         23        Q      Whose idea was it for DOIT to lease space

         24   in the State Center complex?

         25        A      I believe it was the Department of




                                                                       97



          1   Information Technology.

          2        Q      And what was the purpose of that?

          3        A      To consolidate multiple data centers into

          4   one location.

          5        Q      Whose multiple data centers were going to

          6   be consolidated into one location?

          7        A      MTA, Maryland Transit Administration within

          8   the Maryland Department of Transportation, Maryland

          9   Department of Planning, Maryland Department of Health

         10   and Mental Hygiene at the time.

         11        Q      Did you understand that those departments

         12   were also negotiating occupancy leases for the State

         13   Center project?

         14        A      That's my understanding.

         15        Q      And they were going to be committing to

         16   occupy space in the new State Center project, correct?

         17        A      That's my understanding.

         18        Q      And is it fair to say that then the lease

         19   for DOIT was ancillary to the space leases that the

         20   Department of Health or Department of Health and Mental

         21   Hygiene, the Department of Planning and the Maryland

         22   Transit Authority were negotiating?

         23        A      That's my understanding.

         24        Q      And is it fair to say that that lease, the

         25   DOIT lease would not have been necessary if those




                                                                       98



          1   agencies had not committed to leasing space at the

          2   State Center project?

          3               MR. ROSENFELD:  Well, that's fine.  No

          4   objection.

          5               THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to that.

          6   BY MR. BYRON:

          7        Q      Well, the only reason for the DOIT lease to

          8   consolidate a server room is because those agencies are

          9   going to be --

         10        A      Planning.

         11        Q      -- committing to lease space at the State

         12   Center --

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      -- complex, correct?

         15        A      Correct.

         16        Q      So the lease wouldn't have been necessary

         17   unless those agencies committed to leasing space at the

         18   State Center project?

         19        A      Or were planning to.

         20        Q      So you're saying that the lease would only

         21   be necessary if they were just planning to lease space

         22   and they decided not to lease space?  You wouldn't --

         23   you would still go forward with the lease?

         24        A      I don't know where we were in the process

         25   at the time.  I don't know what the other agencies had




                                                                       99



          1   committed to or what they were dedicated to at that

          2   point.  I know the plan was to consolidate data centers

          3   for those agencies and DOIT was a part of that plan.

          4        Q      And the DOIT lease for a consolidated

          5   server only becomes necessary if they commit to lease

          6   space, correct?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      Are you aware of an agreement between a

          9   state and developer called the master development

         10   agreement?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      What do you understand it to be?

         13        A      I understand that's the agreement between

         14   the state, principally General Services Department,

         15   General Services and the developer.  It's kind of the

         16   first phase of the redevelopment of the State Center

         17   complex.

         18        Q      Did DOIT play a role in negotiating the

         19   master development agreement?

         20        A      No, it did not.

         21        Q      Are you aware that the master development

         22   agreement set up a process for finalizing and awarding

         23   the occupancy leases to the developer?

         24        A      It's my understanding.

         25        Q      I'm going to go ahead and mark the master




                                                                      100



          1   development agreement as an exhibit to this deposition.

          2   It will be Exhibit 5.  Okay?

          3        A      Okay.

          4               (Carroll Exhibit 5 was marked for purposes

          5   of identification.)

          6   BY MR. BYRON:

          7        Q      Take a minute to get familiar with the

          8   document.  I will certainly not ask you about the

          9   entire document or 99 percent of the document, but I

         10   will ask you about certain sections and you can

         11   familiarize yourself with those sections while I get

         12   there.

         13        A      (Reviewing document.)

         14               Okay.

         15        Q      Mr. Carroll, Exhibit 5 is a document

         16   entitled:  Master development agreement.

         17               Do you see that?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      The master development agreement is between

         20   the State of Maryland by and through the Department of

         21   General Services and State Center, LLC.

         22               Do you see that?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      This document is dated June 15th, 2009.

         25               Do you see that?




                                                                      101



          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      I want to focus just on one section of the

          3   document and that section is on page 10.  On page 10,

          4   there's a section numbered 2.5.1 that is called

          5   presenting the first phase proposal.

          6               Do you see that section?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      I want you to take a minute to review this

          9   section all the way through the end and then I'm going

         10   to ask you a couple of questions on it.  Okay?

         11        A      Okay.

         12               (Reviewing document.)

         13               Okay.

         14        Q      Is it fair to say that section 2.5.1 sets

         15   forth the process for awarding the occupancy leases?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      Is it fair to say that the first step of

         18   the process is negotiating and finalizing the terms of

         19   the occupancy leases?

         20        A      Yes.

         21        Q      Section 2.5.1.5 on page 11 then sets forth

         22   what is to happen after the occupancy leases are

         23   negotiated and finalized; is that correct?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      Specifically it says:  "Within 180 (180)




                                                                      102



          1   days of agreeing to the terms of the phase ground and

          2   occupancy lease (the BPW submittal period), the

          3   developer and DGS will submit the executed phase ground

          4   lease and occupancy leases for the first phase to the

          5   BPW."

          6               Do you see that?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      Did I read that correctly?

          9        A      Yes.

         10        Q      After the occupancy leases were finalized,

         11   they were meant to be executed by the state, correct?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Then they were meant to be submitted to the

         14   Maryland Board of Public Works for approval, correct?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      The approval by the Board of Public Works

         17   was the last step in the process according to the

         18   master development agreement, correct?

         19               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         20               You may answer.

         21               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         22   BY MR. BYRON:

         23        Q      The occupancy lease for DOIT was negotiated

         24   in the fall of 2010, correct?

         25        A      That's my understanding.




                                                                      103



          1        Q      After it was negotiated, it was sent to

          2   DOIT for review; is that right?

          3        A      That's my understanding, yes.

          4        Q      I'm going to go ahead and mark another

          5   exhibit.

          6               (Carroll Exhibit 6 was marked for purposes

          7   of identification.)

          8   BY MR. BYRON:

          9        Q      When you're ready to answer some questions

         10   about it, let me know.

         11        A      I'm ready.

         12        Q      Is it -- Exhibit 6 is an email dated

         13   November 17th, 2010.

         14               Do you see that?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      The email is from Linda McGovern to Greg

         17   Urban.

         18               Do you see that?

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      And, again, Greg Urban was the DOIT

         21   employee responsible for negotiating and reviewing the

         22   occupancy lease, correct?

         23        A      Correct.

         24        Q      Ms. McGovern says:  "Hi, Greg.  Just left

         25   you a voice mail.  Attached is the occupancy lease for




                                                                      104



          1   DOIT in parcel G of State Center.  It is anticipated to

          2   present this lease to the BPW on December 1."

          3               Did I read that correctly?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      Is the BPW that Ms. McGovern is referring

          6   to the Board of Public Works of Maryland?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      Was the DOIT occupancy lease ultimately

          9   presented to the BPW for approval?

         10        A      An agenda item was presented to the Board

         11   of Public Works for approval.

         12        Q      So you don't -- do you know one way or the

         13   other whether it was sent to the Board of Public Works

         14   for review and then ultimate approval pursuant to that

         15   agenda item?

         16        A      That I'm unaware of.

         17        Q      But you do know that at least an agenda

         18   item that was meant to approve the DOIT occupancy lease

         19   was submitted to the Board of Public Works for review

         20   and then ultimate approval, correct?

         21        A      Correct.

         22        Q      Is it fair to say that DOIT reviewed the

         23   lease before it was presented to BPW in the form of

         24   that agenda item for approval?

         25        A      That's my understanding.




                                                                      105



          1        Q      Is it fair to say that DOIT approved the

          2   lease before it was sent to BPW in the form of that

          3   agenda item for approval?

          4        A      That's my understanding.

          5        Q      And this was fully consistent with what we

          6   just looked at in the master development agreement for

          7   the process for approving the occupancy lease?

          8               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form of that

          9   question.

         10               But you may answer.

         11               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         12   BY MR. BYRON:

         13        Q      Was DOIT asked to sign the DOIT occupancy

         14   lease before it was submitted to the Board of Public

         15   Works for approval?

         16        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         17        Q      Did DOIT sign the DOIT occupancy lease

         18   before it was approved by the Board of Public Works in

         19   December of 2010?

         20        A      No.

         21        Q      Is it fair to say that the fact that the

         22   occupancy lease was not signed by DOIT before it was

         23   sent to the Board of Public Works is inconsistent with

         24   the terms of the master development agreement?

         25               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'm going to object to that




                                                                      106



          1   question to the extent it calls for a legal conclusion.

          2               But to the extent you feel you can answer,

          3   you may answer.

          4               THE WITNESS:  I would say no as I

          5   understand.

          6   BY MR. BYRON:

          7        Q      You don't think it's inconsistent with the

          8   provisions of the master development agreement?

          9        A      Well, no.

         10        Q      Let's pull the master development agreement

         11   back out.  It's Exhibit 5.

         12        A      Okay.

         13        Q      Page 11 in 2.5.1.5 says:  "Within 180 days

         14   of agreeing to the terms of the phase ground and

         15   occupancy lease, the developer and DGS will submit the

         16   executed phase ground lease and occupancy leases for

         17   the final phase to the BPW."

         18               Do you see that this says the BPW would be

         19   presented with executed occupancy leases?

         20        A      Yes.

         21        Q      So the fact that DOIT did not sign the

         22   occupancy lease before it was submitted to BPW for

         23   approval is inconsistent?

         24               MR. ROSENFELD:  Object to that

         25   characterization because Mr. Carroll has testified he's




                                                                      107



          1   not aware of whether or not the occupancy lease was

          2   sent to the BPW, only about an agenda item.  So I

          3   object to that characterization.

          4   BY MR. BYRON:

          5        Q      Let's lay the foundation for the

          6   transmission of the occupancy lease to the BPW before I

          7   ask that again.  Okay?

          8        A      Okay.

          9               (Carroll Exhibit 7 was marked for purposes

         10   of identification.)

         11               THE WITNESS:  (Reviewing document.)

         12   BY MR. BYRON:

         13        Q      Whenever you're ready to answer questions

         14   about that document, I'm ready for you.

         15        A      Okay.  I'm ready.

         16        Q      Exhibit 7 is an email from Mark Bergoffen

         17   to a number of people.

         18               Do you see that?

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      Do you know who Mr. Bergoffen is?

         21        A      I do not.

         22        Q      Are you aware that he served as one of the

         23   state's external lawyers for the State Center project?

         24               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         25               You may answer, if you know.




                                                                      108



          1               THE WITNESS:  No.

          2   BY MR. BYRON:

          3        Q      This email is dated November 19th, 2010.

          4               Do you see that?

          5        A      Yes.

          6        Q      Do you know when the action agenda item

          7   that you were referencing was ultimately approved by

          8   the Board of Public Works?

          9        A      I believe December.

         10        Q      So this is before that action item agenda,

         11   correct?

         12        A      Correct.

         13        Q      In the email, Mr. Bergoffen says:  "All, I

         14   wanted to advise you that today the necessary documents

         15   have been submitted to the BPW staff."

         16               Do you see that?

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      Did I read that correctly?

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      And he says:  "Attached, please find copies

         21   of the documents submitted to the BPW as well as an

         22   updated check list showing the status of the various

         23   documents."

         24               Do you see that?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                      109



          1        Q      Did I read it correctly?

          2        A      Yes.

          3        Q      And if you go to the list of documents that

          4   Mr. Bergoffen attached, do you see there's a number of

          5   documents, correct?

          6        A      Yes.

          7        Q      And attachment 4 reads 04-occupancy lease

          8   (parcel G) DOIT V7 final.docx.

          9               Do you see that?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      I've attached that attachment 4 to Exhibit

         12   7 here.  I did not attach all of these other

         13   attachments or else we'd have a table full of

         14   documents.  I will represent to you that Exhibit 4 is,

         15   in fact, what's been attached to this Exhibit 7.  Okay?

         16   Attachment 4 is what's been attached to this Exhibit 7.

         17   Okay?

         18        A      Okay.

         19               MR. ROSENFELD:  No objection.

         20   BY MR. BYRON:

         21        Q      Now, flip to the attachment.

         22        A      Okay.

         23        Q      Is the attachment here the DOIT occupancy

         24   lease?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                      110



          1        Q      So this email demonstrates that the DOIT

          2   occupancy lease was, in fact, sent to BPW staff for

          3   approval, correct?

          4        A      Correct.

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'm going to object to the

          6   characterization, but I understand he's answered.

          7   BY MR. BYRON:

          8        Q      So back to my question about the master

          9   development agreement.  You said that this occupancy

         10   lease was not signed by the state prior to being sent

         11   to the Board of Public Works for approval, correct?

         12        A      Correct.

         13        Q      So is that inconsistent with the provisions

         14   of the master development agreement in 2.5.1.5?

         15               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'd like to object to the

         16   use of inconsistent insomuch as it refers to the use of

         17   the word approval, sent for approval because the

         18   characterization is that this email sends the document

         19   for approval whereas the email only represents that it

         20   sent necessary documents to the BPW staff and it later

         21   represents there is still some final work to be done on

         22   these documents before the BPW hearing.  That's my

         23   objection, characterization.  Do you want to state the

         24   question or rephrase?

         25   BY MR. BYRON:




                                                                      111



          1        Q      Is it inconsistent with the provision of

          2   the master development agreement that's in section

          3   2.5.1 for DOIT not to sign the occupancy lease before

          4   it went to BPW for approval?

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the extent

          6   that calls for a legal conclusion.

          7               But you may answer to the extent that you

          8   can.

          9               THE WITNESS:  Right.  Yes.

         10   BY MR. BYRON:

         11        Q      Did the Board of Public Works ultimately

         12   approve the DOIT occupancy lease?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      Was it this occupancy lease that was

         15   attached to Exhibit 7?

         16        A      I'm not aware.  There could have been

         17   modifications to the document that would have gone to

         18   the board.

         19        Q      Did you look for modifications for

         20   preparation for today's testimony?

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      Did you find any?

         23        A      No.

         24        Q      This to your knowledge is the final version

         25   of the occupancy lease?




                                                                      112



          1               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the extent he

          2   was given an opportunity to read this document and

          3   familiarize himself with all of its provisions.

          4   BY MR. BYRON:

          5        Q      Please do.  If you want to spend 20, 30

          6   minutes reading it all, that's fine.  I assume you've

          7   seen this document before; is that correct?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      So you've had a chance to familiarize

         10   yourself with this document, correct?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      And so to your knowledge, this is the

         13   occupancy lease that was approved by BPW, correct?

         14               MR. ROSENFELD:  Can I just ask that we

         15   clarify when you say he's seen this document, are you

         16   referring to all of Exhibit 7?

         17   BY MR. BYRON:

         18        Q      Exhibit 7 as it's been introduced in

         19   this -- in this deposition today which is the cover

         20   email and the DOIT occupancy lease that's titled as an

         21   attachment 04-occupancy lease parcel G DOIT V7

         22   final.docx.

         23               MR. ROSENFELD:  To be clear, your question

         24   is did he see all of the Exhibit 7 prior to today?

         25               MR. BYRON:  As it's been introduced in this




                                                                      113



          1   deposition.

          2               MR. ROSENFELD:  Yes, I understand.

          3               MR. BYRON:  Yes.

          4               MR. ROSENFELD:  No objection.

          5               You may answer.

          6               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          7   BY MR. BYRON:

          8        Q      So what's attached as the DOIT occupancy

          9   lease to Exhibit 7 is to your understanding what was

         10   approved by BPW in December of 2010, correct?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      According to the MDA, this approval by BPW

         13   was the last step in the process of awarding the DOIT

         14   occupancy to the developer, correct?

         15               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         16               But you may answer.

         17               Objection, characterization also of this

         18   approval.

         19               But you may answer.

         20               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         21               MR. BYRON:  Sorry, guys.  Can we have a

         22   break?

         23               (There was a brief recess taken.)

         24   BY MR. BYRON:

         25        Q      Do you know the precise date in December of




                                                                      114



          1   2010 when BPW approved the DOIT occupancy lease?

          2        A      December 15th, 2010.

          3        Q      Were you referring to your notes to answer

          4   that question?

          5        A      Yes.

          6               MR. BYRON:  And, again, I'm going to

          7   request that we mark those notes as an exhibit to this

          8   deposition.  I understand you're going to object to it,

          9   but I'm going to request that we mark it right now and

         10   we can ask questions about those notes.

         11               MR. ROSENFELD:  I'm going to object and

         12   instruct the witness not to produce his notes.

         14        Q      After the DOIT lease was approved by the

         15   Board of Public Works, did DOIT start having detailed

         16   programming meetings about its space that it was going

         17   to be occupying at the State Center complex?

         18        A      Not that I'm aware.

         20   of identification.)

         21   BY MR. BYRON:

         22        Q      Mr. Carroll, the court reporter has just

         23   handed you a document that has been marked as Exhibit 8

         24   to today's deposition.  Exhibit 8 is an email from

         25   Sandy Mendler -- two emails from Sandy Mendler that are




                                                                      115



          1   dated December 20th, 2010.

          2               Do you see that?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      The title of the email is programming

          5   kickoff meeting, correct?

          6        A      Yes.

          7        Q      Ms. Mendler says at the bottom email:

          8   "This will be a face-to-face meeting to explore the TI

          9   programming work plan in detail and review critical

         10   decision points."

         11               Did I read that correctly?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      What is the TI programming work plan?

         14        A      I do not know what the TI programming work

         15   plan is.

         16        Q      Would it possibly be tenant improvement

         17   programming work plan?

         18        A      It could be.

         19        Q      Look to the top email from Ms. Mendler.  It

         20   says:  "We are also planning to have individual

         21   sessions with DHMS, MTA, MDP, and DOIT during the

         22   afternoon of the 11th."

         23               Do you see that?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      So DOIT was involved in these TI




                                                                      116



          1   programming work plan meetings that involved the detail

          2   and -- exploring the detail and reviewing critical

          3   decision points for the DOIT space at the State Center,

          4   correct?

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

          6   characterization.

          7               You may answer.

          8               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          9   BY MR. BYRON:

         10        Q      And these meetings are now happening

         11   because DOIT's occupancy lease has been approved by the

         12   Board of Public Works, correct?

         13               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

         14   characterization.

         15               You may answer to the extent that you know.

         16               THE WITNESS:  I don't know why these are

         17   taking place at this particular time.

         18   

         19   BY MR. BYRON:

         20        Q      Would it make sense to you to spend a lot

         21   of money meeting with architects doing detailed space

         22   planning before there was a commitment to occupy space?

         23               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection.

         24               You may answer to the extent you have an

         25   answer.

          1               THE WITNESS:  Perhaps.

          2   BY MR. BYRON:

          3        Q      Do you think it makes sense to spend a lot

          4   of money planning space?

          5               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection, asked and

          6   answered.

          7               THE WITNESS:  Perhaps.

          8   BY MR. BYRON:

          9        Q      Are you aware that a group of downtown

         10   property owners filed a lawsuit against the state in

         11   2010 shortly after BPW approved the DOIT occupancy

         12   lease?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      Are you aware that that lawsuit was an

         15   attempt to stop the State Center project?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      Do you understand that lawsuit is sometimes

         18   referred to as the Lexington Charles litigation?

         19        A      I believe I've heard it referred to as

         20   other things.

         21        Q      As the Angelos litigation maybe?

         22        A      Yes.

         23        Q      If I refer to it as the Lexington Charles

         24   litigation, will you understand my meaning?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                      118



          1        Q      Are you aware that while the Lexington

          2   Charles litigation was pending while it was in court,

          3   the State Center project was effectively put on hold?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      Are you aware that the state with the help

          6   of the developer ultimately won that lawsuit?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      Do you know when that happened?

          9        A      Not specifically.

         10        Q      Do you know a year?

         11        A      2014.

         12        Q      After the Lexington Charles litigation

         13   finished, are you aware that there was an attempt to

         14   restart the State Center project?

         15        A      Yes.

         16        Q      Are you aware that DOIT continued to have

         17   detailed meetings about the design of the space that it

         18   had committed to lease at State Center?

         19               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         20               You may answer it.

         21               THE WITNESS:  I was aware of meetings.

         22   BY MR. BYRON:

         23        Q      And those meetings were about the design of

         24   the space that DOIT had committed to lease, correct?

         25               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the




                                                                      119



          1   characterization.

          2               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          3               (Carroll Exhibit 9 was marked for purposes

          4   of identification.)

          5   BY MR. BYRON:

          6        Q      The court reporter has just handed you an

          7   email that has been marked as Exhibit 9 to today's

          8   deposition.  Exhibit 9 is an email exchange between

          9   David Mangrum and John Hergenroeder.

         10               Do you see that?

         11        A      Yes.

         12        Q      Who is John Hergenroeder?

         13        A      I know he's an employee at the Department

         14   of General Services.

         15        Q      Do you know what his role was?

         16        A      I don't recall a specific title, but I

         17   believe he helped with the negotiations regarding the

         18   Department of General Services and the developer.

         19        Q      And who is David Mangrum?

         20        A      In this time period, Dave Mangrum is the

         21   chief of infrastructure or acting chief of

         22   infrastructure.

         23        Q      Did he take Greg Urban's role?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      Greg Urban got promoted to --




                                                                      120



          1        A      Greg Urban is then chief operating officer

          2   for the agency.

          3        Q      Now, he's involved in the space planning

          4   for DOIT?

          5        A      He continued to be involved.  So Dave was a

          6   member of the Department of Information Technology

          7   infrastructure team and he was promoted.  So Dave has

          8   been involved for some time.

          9        Q      Understood.  So he was -- he was a junior

         10   guy to Greg Urban who was planning the space?

         11        A      Correct.

         12        Q      And he took the lead role, so to speak --

         13        A      Correct.

         14        Q      -- at this point in time or before this

         15   point in time?

         16        A      That's my understanding.

         17        Q      This email is dated -- it's actually two

         18   emails which are both dated December 2nd, 2014.

         19               Do you see that?

         20        A      Yes.

         21        Q      It's titled meeting to discuss State Center

         22   project.

         23               Do you see that?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      In the bottom email, is it fair to say that




                                                                      121



          1   Mr. Mangrum is asking Mr. Hergenroeder the purpose of

          2   the meeting that is the subject line?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      And Mr. Hergenroeder's response is as

          5   follows:  "We will be meeting with the architect for

          6   the project to discuss the layout of the space, the

          7   location and the power mechanical systems needed to

          8   support the operation."

          9               Did I read that correctly?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      So in 2014, DOIT again started to have

         12   detailed discussions about the design of the space that

         13   it had committed to lease at the State Center project,

         14   correct?

         15        A      The department had conversations.

         16        Q      So the answer is yes?

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      Did the state ultimately move forward with

         19   the State Center project?

         20        A      No.

         21        Q      Did DOIT make its own decision to not move

         22   forward with the State Center project?

         23        A      That is not a decision that the Department

         24   of Information Technology would make.

         25        Q      Who made that decision to your




                                                                      122



          1   understanding?

          2        A      Anything regarding going real estate would

          3   involve the Department of General Services, not the

          4   Department of Information Technology.

          5        Q      Was DOIT told by the Department of General

          6   Services that the state would not be moving forward

          7   with the State Center project?

          8        A      I've seen no information to that effect,

          9   correspondence or anything.

         10        Q      So the answer is to your knowledge, DOIT

         11   was not told that?

         12        A      Correct.

         13        Q      Was DOIT told any reasons as to why the

         14   State Center project would not be moving forward?

         15        A      It was not.

         16               MR. ROSENFELD:  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No

         17   objection.

         18   BY MR. BYRON:

         19        Q      Did DOIT have any discussions with the

         20   Department of General Services or any other state

         21   agency about why the State Center project would not be

         22   moving forward?

         23        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         24        Q      So DOIT does not have any understanding of

         25   why the State Center project didn't move forward?




                                                                      123



          1        A      No.

          2        Q      Did DOIT agree or disagree with the

          3   decision not to move forward with the State Center

          4   project?

          5        A      I don't believe the department had an

          6   opinion on whether to move forward.

          7        Q      So they were agnostic?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      Did representatives with DOIT meet with the

         10   governor's office regarding the State Center project

         11   around the time the State Center project was

         12   terminated?

         13        A      Not that I'm aware of.

         14               (Carroll Exhibit 10 was marked for purposes

         15   of identification.)

         16   BY MR. BYRON:

         17        Q      This is my last piece of paper for the day

         18   and it has been marked as Exhibit 10 to today's

         19   deposition.  And it's been handed to you by the court

         20   reporter.

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      Are you ready to answer some questions

         23   about it?

         24        A      Yes.

         25        Q      Exhibit 10 is an email from Cara Bowman to




                                                                      124



          1   Sam Malhotra, Andrea Garvey, Kaitlin Marsden, and

          2   Douglas Mayer.

          3               Do you see that?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      Who is Kara Bowman?

          6        A      Kara Bowman is the special assistant to the

          7   governor.

          8        Q      What does special assistant to the governor

          9   do?

         10        A      Everything.  She's the governor's henchman.

         11   No.  This person in particular sits in on meetings,

         12   takes notes, follow-up action items, et cetera.

         13        Q      This wasn't your role, was it, at one

         14   point?

         15        A      No.

         16        Q      And who is Sam Melhotra?

         17        A      At this time, Sam would have been the

         18   incoming chief of staff or the chief of staff for the

         19   governor.

         20        Q      Just so we're clear for the record, Kara

         21   Bowman is the special assistant to the governor and the

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      And Mr. Melhotra is the incoming chief of

         25   staff for Governor Hogan, correct?




                                                                      125



          1        A      Yes.

          2        Q      Who is Andrea Garvey?

          3        A      Andrea Garvey is or was at this time the

          4   special assistant to Sam Melhotra.

          5        Q      So she's in the governor's office?

          6        A      Yes.

          7        Q      And what is her role?

          8        A      Special assistant to the chief of staff, to

          9   Sam Melhotra, similar duties as assigned.

         10        Q      Anything that's needed that she has to do,

         11   she does?

         12        A      They make it happen, yes.

         13        Q      Who is Kaitlin Marsdan?

         14        A      Kaitlin Marsdan is the executive assistant

         15   to the chief of staff.

         16        Q      And by the chief of staff here, you mean?

         17        A      Sam Melhotra.

         18        Q      Sam Melhotra.  Okay.

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      Why does she have a DOIT email address?

         21        A      Kaitlin Marsdan used to work at Department

         22   of Information Technology and when she transitioned

         23   over, this -- she transitioned over two weeks prior to

         24   this.  So the emails had not been migrated over to say

         25   gov at the end.  So those monikers take time to kind of




                                                                      126



          1   populate to the system which is the same for Andrea

          2   Garvey why it says DHR which was human resources.  At

          3   the time, she was transitioning from that agency.  Sam

          4   Melhotra was the secretary of the Department of Human

          5   Resources as well.  So they came together.  Kaitlin

          6   transitioned from DOIT.

          7        Q      It all makes sense now why you asked her

          8   when she transitioned?

          9        A      Yes.

         10        Q      So when did Ms. Marsdan transition to the

         11   governor's office as you learned?

         12        A      Two weeks prior to this email.  Where does

         13   that put us?

         14        Q      October.

         15        A      No, no.  It would have been mid November.

         16        Q      I'm sorry.  You're right.  I'm thinking

         17   November 1, but in November is when you learned she

         18   transitioned --

         19        A      Yes.

         20        Q      -- to the governor's office?

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      And who is Douglas Mayer?

         23        A      Douglas Mayer at the time would have been

         24   the governor's communications director.

         25        Q      I'm going to ask these questions.  I'm




                                                                      127



          1   pretty sure I know the answer to them now, but I'm

          2   going to go ask them anyway.  This email is dated

          3   November 30, 2016, correct?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      This is a little bit under a month before

          6   the State Center project was terminated, correct?

          7        A      That's my understanding.

          8        Q      And the State Center project was terminated

          9   by the Board of Public Works, correct?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      And Governor Hogan sits on the Board of

         12   Public Works, right?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      The email is titled State Center, correct?

         15        A      Correct.

         16        Q      And the email says or Ms. Bowman in the

         17   email says:  "The governor would like to convene a

         18   group of folks to discuss this issue as soon as

         19   possible."

         20               Do you see that?

         21        A      Yes.

         22        Q      So she's asking to convene a group of folks

         23   to discuss the State Center as soon as possible as you

         24   understand it, correct?

         25        A      Yes.




                                                                      128



          1        Q      Do you know if this meeting happened?

          2        A      I do not.

          3        Q      Do you know whether DOIT took part in this

          4   meeting?

          5        A      I do not.

          6        Q      Do you know what was discussed at this

          7   meeting at all?

          8        A      I do not.

          9        Q      Did you talk to Ms. Marsdan about whether

         10   this meeting happened?

         11        A      I did not.

         12        Q      Is DOIT aware of any discussions about the

         13   state's plan for the State Center?

         14               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to form.

         15   Timeframe?

         18   cancellation.

         19        A      The department has not.

         20        Q      Have they been involved in any discussions

         21   about the plan for State Center post cancellation?

         22        A      The department has not.

         23        Q      Is the department aware that the state

         24   issued a request for expression of interest seeking a

         25   new master developer for State Center in July 2018?




                                                                      129



          1        A      No.

          2        Q      Does the department know anything about

          3   that request for expression of interest?

          4        A      No.

          5        Q      Are you aware of any changes in the real

          6   estate market from 2010 to 2016 that made the State

          7   Center project less attractive in 2016?

          8        A      No.

          9        Q      Are you aware of any technological changes

         10   from 2010 to 2016 that made the State Center project

         11   less attractive in 2016?

         12        A      No.

         13        Q      Are you aware of any changes to the

         14   national economy from 2010 to 2016 that made the State

         15   Center project less attractive to DOIT in 2016 than in

         16   2010?

         17        A      No.

         18        Q      What about changes in the local economy,

         19   are you aware of any that made the project less

         20   attractive in 2016?

         21        A      No.

         22        Q      I want to move topics and talk about the

         23   document collection and production that DOIT did with

         24   respect to the occupancy leases, correct?  Is that

         25   okay?




                                                                      130



          1        A      Yes, sure.

          2        Q      I understand that you have only been

          3   designated to serve as DOIT's representative on hard

          4   copy collection; is that right?

          5        A      Yes.

          6        Q      And you do not intend today to talk about

          7   any email collection, correct?

          8        A      Correct.

          9        Q      Or any electronic document collection at

         10   all?

         11        A      Correct.

         12        Q      Who was involved in identifying documents

         13   for collection and production at DOIT?

         14        A      It was my understanding the request came in

         15   on early 2017 and the request was forwarded to then

         16   chief of staff, Al Bullock.  Al Bullock then made a

         17   request of the infrastructure team headed by Dave

         18   Mangrum to conduct the search for documents.

         19        Q      For hard copy documents?

         20        A      Hard copy documents and they came up with

         21   no results.

         22        Q      Okay.  So a request came in in early 2017?

         23        A      I believe February 2017.

         24        Q      To Al Bullock?

         25        A      Correct.




                                                                      131



          1        Q      Who did that request come from?

          2        A      That I don't recall.

          3        Q      You don't know whether it was the lawyers

          4   or someone else?

          5        A      Probably, yes, is my understanding.

          6        Q      And do you know what the request asked

          7   specifically?

          8        A      I believe it asked for documentation

          9   regarding State Center.  I don't know how specific it

         10   was, but --

         11        Q      You think it was any documents regarding

         12   State Center?

         13        A      That's my understanding.

         14        Q      And then Mr. Bullock forward the request to

         15   Mr. Mangrum?

         16        A      Yes.

         17        Q      And what did Mr. Mangrum do to determine

         18   whether any documents existed with respect to State

         19   Center?

         20        A      He conducted the search of his files and

         21   any files within the infrastructure group and came up

         22   with nothing.

         23        Q      Okay.  So he conducted a search of his

         24   files.  What locations?

         25        A      His office primarily.  He has a pretty




                                                                      132



          1   simple office with a file cabinet.

          2        Q      And what is again his role right now?

          3        A      The chief of infrastructure.

          4        Q      Chief of infrastructure.  And then you

          5   said -- so as to his office, he conducted his -- a

          6   search of his own office?

          7        A      Yes.

          8        Q      And then you said he conducted a search of

          9   other --

         10        A      Members of his team.

         11        Q      Members of his team?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Do you know who those were?

         14        A      I don't know who would have been the

         15   members of the team at that time.

         16        Q      Do you know their titles?

         17        A      Not off the top of my head.  They're

         18   network engineers.  There's the director of data

         19   transport.  There's some.

         20        Q      Did he just ask those folks if they had any

         21   documents or did he go physically search each of their

         22   offices?

         23        A      It's my understanding that he asked them to

         24   search.

         25        Q      He asked each of those people to search,




                                                                      133



          1   but you can't give me a list of who those were?

          2        A      Correct.

          3        Q      So all you know for sure was that

          4   Mr. Mangrum searched his own office, correct?

          5        A      Correct.

          6        Q      And then he asked others on his team to

          7   search their offices?

          8        A      Correct.

          9        Q      But you don't know who those people were?

         10        A      Correct.

         11        Q      And you don't know whether they did?

         12        A      Correct.

         13        Q      Do you know what Mr. Mangrum told those

         14   individuals about what they were searching for?

         15        A      I believe State Center documentation.

         16        Q      You said I believe a couple of times in

         17   response to these questions -- do you know for sure or

         18   are you guessing?

         19        A      That's what Dave has told me.

         20        Q      That's fine.  So Mr. Mangrum told you he

         21   said to members of his team go search for documents --

         22        A      Right.

         23        Q      -- that relate to the State Center project?

         24        A      Correct.

         25        Q      And according for Mr. Mangrum, they did




                                                                      134



          1   that, correct?

          2        A      Correct.

          3        Q      And they came back and told Mr. Mangrum

          4   they don't have anything?

          5        A      Correct.

          6        Q      Aside from Mr. Mangrum's office and these

          7   other individuals' offices that may or may not have

          8   been searched, were any other physical locations

          9   searched for documents?

         10        A      It is my understanding that another request

         11   came in in 2018.  That request went to Stan Kizior who

         12   is no longer with the agency.  He's the assistant -- he

         13   was the assistant secretary for operations.  Dave

         14   Mangrum reported to Stan Kizior.  There was another

         15   search conducted within the infrastructure team, Dave's

         16   team.  There was a search conducted with the Board of

         17   Public Works' liaison office within DOIT, a young lady

         18   named Carla Thompson, her files, and the office of the

         19   chief operating officer was also searched.

         20        Q      So there was a supplemental search that

         21   came in in 2018, correct?

         22        A      Correct.

         23        Q      And that went to Stan Kizior?

         24        A      Correct.

         25        Q      And then Mr. Kizior ordered a series of




                                                                      135



          1   searches, correct?

          2        A      Correct.

          3        Q      And Mr. Kizior ordered as I understand it

          4   four different searches; is that correct?  And I'll go

          5   through them if --

          6        A      That sounds accurate.

          7        Q      The first search that Mr. Kizior ordered

          8   was for the infrastructure team to redouble their

          9   efforts and search their offices again?

         10        A      Correct.

         11        Q      Do you know who he communicated that to?

         12        A      Dave Mangrum.

         13        Q      And Dave then communicated it to his team?

         14        A      To his subordinates to do another search.

         15        Q      So you know that Dave Mangrum searched his

         16   own office again?

         17        A      Yes.

         18        Q      And you learned that from Mr. Mangrum

         19   himself?

         20        A      Yes.

         21        Q      Do you know who else searched their offices

         22   in 2018?

         23        A      No.

         24        Q      And you don't know whether they, in fact,

         25   searched their offices?




                                                                      136



          1        A      I know that Dave asked them to.  I don't

          2   know who the individuals on the team would have been.

          3        Q      Was Mr. Mangrum's request, was it the same

          4   request that he had asked in 2017, search for anything

          5   State Center related?

          6        A      I believe so.

          7        Q      And, again, these employees according to

          8   Mr. Mangrum reported to him that they had found

          9   nothing?

         10        A      Correct.

         11        Q      And you mentioned that the BPW approval

         12   liaison office or something to that effect was asked to

         13   search some of their files?

         14        A      Correct.

         15        Q      So who asked them to do that?

         16        A      That would have come from Stan Kizior.

         17        Q      How do you know that happened?

         18        A      That's my understanding from Dave's

         19   recollection of the events as well.  So Stan is no

         20   longer there.

         21        Q      Mr. Mangrum told you that Mr. Kizior asked

         22   the liaison office to search their files?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      Who was asked specifically there?

         25        A      Carla Thompson.




                                                                      137



          1        Q      I know you said her role, but I'd prefer

          2   not to scroll up.

          3        A      She's the liaison to the -- the Department

          4   of Information Technology liaison to the Board of

          5   Public Works.

          6        Q      So she would be submitting things for the

          7   Board of Public Works' approval on behalf of the --

          8        A      Agency, yes.

          9        Q      -- the agency DOIT?

         10        A      Correct.

         11        Q      And what was she asked to search for?

         12        A      I believe files pertaining to State Center.

         13        Q      And she reported to Mr. Kizior to

         14   Mr. Mangrum's information that she had found no files?

         15        A      Right.

         16        Q      And then you said the chief operating

         17   officer was asked to search for files?

         18        A      I believe the office for the chief

         19   operating officer was searched.  There was no -- I do

         20   know if that was physically Stan Kizior's office or

         21   there was another office that houses another assistant

         22   secretary that could have been that person as well.

         23        Q      I'm going to ask about that in just a

         24   second.  I want to go back to Ms. Thompson real quick.

         25        A      Sure.




                                                                      138



          1        Q      Was Ms. Thompson the liaison for BPW in

          2   2010?

          3        A      I do not believe so.

          4        Q      Do you know who that was?

          5        A      No.

          6        Q      Do you know whether that individual's files

          7   were searched?

          8        A      No.

          9        Q      So back to the office of the chief

         10   operating officer.  So you don't think anyone in the

         11   office was actually asked to search for documents, but

         12   someone came in and did it for them?

         13        A      Correct.

         14        Q      And who did that?

         15        A      That I do not know.

         16        Q      You don't know when that was conducted?

         17        A      No.

         18        Q      Do you know whether it was conducted?

         19        A      I don't know.  I know that counsel was

         20   involved, but I don't know when, you know.

         21        Q      Counsel being Mr. Rosenfeld's firm?

         22        A      Or AG.

         23        Q      So Mr. Harp possibly?

         24        A      Possibly.

         25        Q      There was a fourth thing, I believe.




                                                                      139



          1        A      You said that, but --

          2        Q      Maybe it was just three.  So that's all in

          3   this 2018 timeframe, the infrastructure liaison's

          4   office and then someone who you don't know did a search

          5   of the chief operating officer's office?

          6        A      Right.

          7        Q      When you say office, do you mean just like

          8   a single office?

          9        A      I mean a single office.

         10        Q      That person's office?

         11        A      Um-hmm.

         12        Q      I assume the chief operating officer has

         13   changed?

         14        A      Yes.

         15        Q      And who is the chief operating officer now?

         16        A      A gentleman named Andrew Van Johnny.

         17        Q      Who was the chief operating officer in

         18   2010?

         19        A      Stan Kizior had the title, but, you know,

         20   that's --

         21        Q      Do you know whether his files were

         22   searched?

         23        A      I believe he searched his own files.

         24        Q      You believe he searched those.  How do you

         25   know that?




                                                                      140



          1        A      Just based on kind of the flow of just

          2   talking to people, Dave Mangrum, counsel about the way

          3   the search was conducted.

          4        Q      But Mr. Kizior has not confirmed that he

          5   searched his own files?

          6        A      I have not spoken with Mr. Kizior.

          7        Q      And Mr. Mangrum confirmed that Mr. Kizior

          8   had searched his files?

          9        A      To his understanding, yes.

         10        Q      Were there any other search efforts?  So we

         11   had talked about a 2017 period and a 2018 search

         12   period.  Were there any others?

         13        A      That is all I'm aware of.

         14        Q      Does DOIT maintain central file rooms?

         15        A      No.

         16        Q      Do they maintain file cabinets in their

         17   office?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      And are those outside of offices?

         20        A      Some are in their own location.  Some are

         21   within offices.  It depends on which division we're

         22   talking about within the agency.

         23        Q      Were -- were any of those file cabinets

         24   that are outside of the offices that we just mentioned

         25   searched?




                                                                      141



          1        A      I would assume, but I don't -- I can't

          2   speak to how thorough the search was for those

          3   documents.

          4        Q      Do you know whether any of those file

          5   cabinets contained any documents relating to the State

          6   Center?

          7        A      Not that I'm aware of.

          8        Q      You don't know that for a fact?  Did you

          9   ask anyone about that?

         10        A      No.

         11        Q      You didn't ask anyone if they were searched

         12   either?

         13        A      No.

         14        Q      So you have no idea if the file cabinets

         15   outside of offices have documents, correct?

         16        A      Correct.

         17        Q      About State Center, correct?

         18        A      Correct.  But the individuals relayed to me

         19   that I spoke with that they searched their files.

         20   Their files could be in their office.  Their files

         21   could be in those file cabinets.

         22        Q      But most of those individuals, in fact,

         23   everyone except Mr. Mangrum was not around in 2010 and

         24   maybe Mr. Mangrum wasn't either?  He wasn't?

         25        A      Right.




                                                                      142



          1        Q      So none of those individuals were around in

          2   2010?

          3        A      Correct.

          4        Q      So if an individual from 2010 had documents

          5   that were relevant or related to the occupancy leases

          6   and those were in common file cabinets, you wouldn't

          7   know whether those were searched or not?

          8        A      No.

          9        Q      Does the Department of Information

         10   Technology have off site storage?

         11        A      We do not have off site storage.  We have a

         12   records retention policy that the records have to be

         13   kept for five years.  And after five years, they're

         14   then transferred to the state archives.

         15        Q      Where is the state archives located?

         16        A      In Annapolis.

         17        Q      And do you know how long they're kept in

         18   state archives?

         19        A      I believe it's another five years after

         20   that.

         21        Q      So if we were to look for a document from

         22   2010, it would still be in the state archives?

         23        A      It should be.

         24        Q      Were the state archives searched by DOIT

         25   for documents related to the occupancy lease?




                                                                      143



          1        A      Not that I'm aware of.

          2        Q      Are there any other locations that hard

          3   copy documents may be kept that DOIT is involved in?

          4        A      No.

          5        Q      What about leases?  Are there any other

          6   locations that leases may be kept that DOIT is a

          7   signatory to or a party to?

          8        A      The Department of General Services

          9   potentially.

         10        Q      We've talked about this a bit, but DOIT has

         11   its own assistant attorney general, correct?

         12        A      Yes.

         13        Q      Who are they?

         14        A      Howard Barr, Kevin Harp, and Scott Moore.

         15   And there's one more and I don't recall her name.

         16        Q      Does the assistant attorney general for

         17   DOIT generally review contracts that DOIT enters into?

         18        A      Yes.

         19        Q      Would that person have -- would an

         20   assistant attorney general have been involved in the

         21   review of the occupancy leases at all?

         22        A      That would make sense to me.

         23        Q      And if there was a copy of an executed

         24   occupancy lease that DOIT had, would that person likely

         25   have a copy of it?




                                                                      144



          1        A      I would believe so.

          2        Q      Did DOIT search the files of their attorney

          3   generals for copies of the occupancy lease?

          4        A      That I don't know.

          5        Q      But that wasn't told to you that that was

          6   done?

          7        A      Correct.

          8        Q      So sitting here today, the answer is as far

          9   as you're aware, it didn't happen?

         10        A      As far as I'm aware, yes.

         11        Q      Were Greg Urban's hard copy files searched?

         12        A      Those would have been in the office of the

         13   chief operating officer.  There are only three places

         14   any of those individuals would sit within our location.

         15        Q      So those would have been in Dave Mangrum's

         16   office?

         17        A      They would have been in Mangrum's office or

         18   they would have been in eventually Stan Kizior's

         19   office.

         20        Q      And your understanding is that Mr. Kizior's

         21   office and Mr. Mangrum's office were searched for hard

         22   copy documents?

         23        A      Yes.

         24        Q      What about Ms. Cropper, Stacia Cropper,

         25   were her files searched?




                                                                      145



          1        A      That I do not know.

          2        Q      Betsy Jackson, were her files searched?

          3        A      Yes.

          4        Q      What part of the search covered Ms.

          5   Jackson's files?

          6        A      So Betsy supported Greg Urban as well as

          7   the secretary starting in 2014.  So she had, you know,

          8   she had files that she was able to search through that

          9   were just in the file cabinets.  She looked for

         10   information I'm sure that Greg probably asked her to

         11   look for.

         12        Q      So Ms. Jackson, is she still with DOIT?

         13        A      Yes.

         14        Q      And Mr. Mangrum -- your understanding is

         15   that Mr. Mangrum would have asked her to search for --

         16        A      Dave would have searched his own.  Betsy

         17   would have searched her stuff as well.

         18        Q      He would have told Ms. Jackson to search?

         19        A      No.  He wouldn't have told Betsy to do

         20   anything because she doesn't report to him.  Betsy

         21   would have checked her records just based on the fact

         22   that she worked with Stan who is the chief operating

         23   officer or the assistant secretary at the time.  The

         24   executive assistant to the secretary sits out in a

         25   common area where there are file cabinets and that's




                                                                      146



          1   where her desk is.  So she would coordinate whatever

          2   needed to be done coming from the assistant secretary

          3   or the secretary.

          4        Q      Did you talk to Ms. Jackson about

          5   whether --

          6        A      Yes.

          7        Q      -- she searched her files?

          8        A      Yes.

          9        Q      And she told you she had?

         10        A      Yes.

         11        Q      And she searched at her desk and the file

         12   cabinets that she keeps?

         13        A      Correct.

         14        Q      What part -- you mentioned two different

         15   review periods.  Did she do it both in 2017 and 2018 or

         16   just one of those?

         17        A      She didn't specify to me the period.

         18        Q      Who is Michael Mallinoff?

         19        A      My understanding is that he was the COO

         20   from 2014 to 2015.

         21        Q      And Mr. Mallinoff's files would have been

         22   searched by virtue of the chief operating officer file

         23   search?

         24        A      Right.

         25        Q      That you're not sure who did or when?




                                                                      147



          1        A      Correct.

          2        Q      And then Ms. Marsdan, did she have any

          3   involvement at all in the State Center project?

          4        A      No.

          5        Q      Aside from what we saw?

          6        A      Not that I'm aware of.

          7        Q      So is it fair to say her files were not

          8   searched?

          9        A      Her files would have been commingled with

         10   Betsy Jackson's files because Kaitlin and Betsy were

         11   support staff to the secretary sitting in that same

         12   common area.

         13        Q      During the course of document collection,

         14   hard copy document collection, did DOIT learn that any

         15   files related to the occupancy leases or any versions

         16   of the occupancy lease or anything about the occupancy

         17   leases had been destroyed?

         18        A      No.

         19        Q      So as far as DOIT is aware, DOIT still

         20   possesses in terms of hard copy documents everything

         21   that relates to the occupancy leases?

         22        A      Correct.

         23        Q      For sake of completeness, I know you did

         24   this at the very beginning.  This is going to take

         25   about two minutes.  I'm going to just close the topics




                                                                      148



          1   that I think you had zero information on in the notice,

          2   but if you have information, please let me know.  Okay?

          3        A      Sure.

          4        Q      You were designated today to testify about

          5   DOIT's knowledge of the negotiating and drafting of the

          6   phase ground leases, correct?

          7        A      Correct.

          8        Q      Was DOIT involved in negotiating and

          9   drafting of the phase ground leases?

         10        A      No.

         11        Q      Does DOIT have any knowledge about this

         12   topic?

         13        A      No.

         14        Q      You were designated to testify about DOIT's

         15   knowledge of the negotiating and drafting of the

         16   component leases, correct?

         17        A      Repeat the question.

         18        Q      You were designated today to testify about

         19   DOIT's knowledge of the negotiating and drafting of the

         20   component leases, correct?

         21        A      Correct.

         22        Q      Was DOIT involved in the negotiating and

         23   drafting of the component leases?

         24        A      No.

         25        Q      Does DOIT have any knowledge about this




                                                                      149



          1   topic?

          2        A      No.

          3        Q      You were designated to testify about DOIT's

          4   knowledge of the negotiating and drafting of the

          5   closing agreement, correct?

          6        A      Correct.

          7        Q      Was DOIT involved in negotiating and

          8   drafting of the closing agreement?

          9        A      No.

         10        Q      Does DOIT have any knowledge about this

         11   topic?

         12        A      No.

         13        Q      All right.  Mr. Carroll, at this time, I

         14   don't have any further questions for you.  I may have a

         15   brief follow-up depending on what Mr. Rosenfeld does.

         16   I think it makes sense to take a short break and then

         17   we can get started.

         18               MR. ROSENFELD:  I have so very few.  I

         19   doubt that we'll need a break.

         20               MR. BYRON:  Sounds good.

         21               EXAMINATION BY MR. ROSENFELD

         22        Q      I want to turn back quickly, Mr. Carroll,

         23   to Exhibit 8.  That is a December 2010 email.

         24        A      Okay.

         25        Q      I want you to look at the top email.  You




                                                                      150



          1   will agree that that's an email that Mr. Byron

          2   discussed with you, asked you questions about; is that

          3   right?

          4        A      Yes.

          5        Q      Do you see in the to, from, or CC line any

          6   Department of Information Technology email addresses

          7   for that email?

          8        A      I do not.

          9        Q      If you could look at the email below.  I

         10   know it's truncated, but do you see any indication that

         11   that email was sent or received by any Department of

         12   Information Technology personnel?

         13        A      I do not.

         14        Q      Is it fair to say that your understanding

         15   is that no one from the Department of Information

         16   Technology received this message or sent this message?

         17               MR. BYRON:  Object to the form of the

         18   question.

         19               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

         20   BY MR. ROSENFELD:

         21        Q      Okay.  This state archives.  Do you have

         22   any reason to believe that there would be documents

         23   related to the State Center project from the Department

         24   of Information Technology at the state archives?

         25        A      No.




                                                                      151



          1        Q      Why do you feel that way?

          2        A      The department didn't sign any agreements

          3   that it would need to keep on file to then proceed to

          4   ship to the state archive.

          5        Q      So as part of the department's document

          6   retention policy, is it the case that certain documents

          7   are destroyed rather than saved at the end of five

          8   years?

          9        A      Yes.

         10        Q      What's the distinction between a document

         11   that gets saved and gets destroyed at the end of five

         12   years to the extent you know?

         13        A      They would be executed agreements or

         14   completed agreements or contracts that are in effect is

         15   my understanding.

         16        Q      Are the ones that are saved?

         17        A      That are saved.

         18        Q      Do you have as a result of your preparation

         19   for testimony here today independent of your

         20   conversations with counsel, do you have an opinion on

         21   behalf of DOIT whether or not DOIT executed the

         22   occupancy leases in this case, the occupancy lease in

         23   this case?

         24               MR. BYRON:  Object to the form of the

         25   question.




                                                                      152



          1               THE WITNESS:  I do not.

          2   BY MR. ROSENFELD:

          3        Q      Sorry.  Do you have an opinion whether or

          4   not DOIT ever executed an occupancy lease in this case?

          5               MR. BYRON:  Object to the form of the

          6   question.

          7               THE WITNESS:  I don't believe the agency

          8   ever executed an agreement or signed an agreement.

          9   BY MR. ROSENFELD:

         10        Q      So it is the agency's position that there

         11   are no executed occupancy leases on behalf of DOIT?

         12               MR. BYRON:  Object to the form of the

         13   question.

         14               THE WITNESS:  Correct.

         15   BY MR. ROSENFELD:

         16        Q      Just to -- for the sake of total

         17   completeness, Mr. Byron used terminology before about

         18   committing to lease the space.  Is it the agency's

         19   understanding that it ever bound itself to lease the

         20   space at the contemplated State Center office complex?

         21   He's going to object, so let him object.  Is that

         22   the -- is it the agency's understanding that it ever

         23   bound itself to lease office space at the anticipated

         24   State Center office complex?

         25               MR. BYRON:  Object to the form of the




                                                                      153



          1   question.

          2               THE WITNESS:  It is the position of the

          3   agency that it did not commit.

          4               MR. ROSENFELD:  Thank you.  Those are all

          5   my questions.

          6               MR. BYRON:  Just real briefly.

          7               FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MR. BYRON

          8        Q      To determine the agency's position about

          9   whether it had committed to lease space in 2010, you

         10   didn't speak to anyone at the agency who was around in

         11   2010, right?

         12        A      That is correct.

         13        Q      The only people you spoke with was your

         14   lawyer?

         15               MR. ROSENFELD:  Object to the

         16   characterization.

         17   BY MR. BYRON:

         18        Q      About that issue.

         19        A      I spoke with Dave Mangrum and Betsy Jackson

         20   in the department.

         21        Q      Who were not around in 2010, correct?

         22        A      Correct.

         23        Q      So they do not have any knowledge about

         24   what happened in 2010?

         25               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the




                                                                      154



          1   characterization.

          2               But you may answer.

          3               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

          4   BY MR. BYRON:

          5        Q      So your view and opinion about whether the

          6   state had committed itself or the department had

          7   committed itself to lease space at the State Center

          8   project in 2010 is formed by discussions with counsel

          9   and a review of certain documents that counsel provided

         10   to you, correct?

         11               MR. ROSENFELD:  Objection to the

         12   characterization.

         13               But you may answer.

         14               THE WITNESS:  Correct.

         15               MR. BYRON:  I don't have any further

         16   questions.

         17               MR. ROSENFELD:  Okay.

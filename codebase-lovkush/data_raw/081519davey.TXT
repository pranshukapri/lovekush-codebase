         5      a witness called for examination by counsel for

         6      the Plaintiff, being first duly sworn, was

         7      examined and testified as follows:

         8               MS. HACKETT:  Are you good with the usual

         9      stipulations?

        10                MS. SEARS:  Yes.

        11                MS. HACKETT:  So all objections

        12   except as to the form of the question are

        13   reserved and being raised for the first time at

        14   trial and motions to strike reserved for the

        15   first time at trial.  The parties will agree to

        16   waive notary and the witness will read and sign

        17   under the pains and penalties of perjury within

        18   30 days of the receipt of the transcript.

        19           That last part just means within 30 days

        20   -- when we get the transcript we will send it to

        21   you.  You sign it.  Have it notarized.  Send it

        22   back to us with any changes, if you have any,

        23   within 30 days.

        24                THE WITNESS:  Sure.

         1                    DIRECT EXAMINATION

         2   BY MS. HACKETT:

         3       Q.  Could you state your name and address for

         4   the record, please?

         5       A.  Lisa Davey, 135 East Emerson Road,

         6   Lexington, Massachusetts.

         7       Q.  My name is Amy Hackett.  I am going to

         8   ask you questions today.  Have you ever been

         9   deposed before?

        10       A.  Yes.

        11       Q.  You know how this works?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13       Q.  In general if I ask you a question and

        14   you don't understand it, if it is vague or

        15   ambiguous, ask me to clarify and I will do my

        16   best to make sure it is clear.  If you answer my

        17   question I will assume that you understood it.

        18   Okay?

        19       A.  Yes.

        20       Q.  If you need to take a break for any

        21   reason, just let me know.  I just ask that if

        22   there is a pending question, you finish it first.

        23       A.  Okay.

        24       Q.  Then we can take the break.

                                                                  7



         1           Two more things.  It is important we

         2   don't talk over each other.  I have a tendency to

         3   do that too.  It is hard for the court reporter

         4   to take things down if we are both talking at the

         5   same time.  The same goes for your verbal answers

         6   to the questions.  It is -- she can't take down a

         7   head nod or things like that.

         8       A.  Correct.

         9       Q.  If you can say "yes", "no", that type of

        10   thing, it would be helpful.  Are you represented

        11   by an attorney here today?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13                MS. SEARS:  No.

        14       A.  Sorry.  No.

        15       Q.  You are here pursuant to a subpoena --

        16       A.  Yes.

        17       Q.  -- issued to you, correct?

        18                (Exhibit 1 marked

        19                for identification)

        20       Q.  Did you bring any documents with you

        21   today?

        22       A.  I brought what was requested during the

        23   discovery.  So I brought the whole file that I

        24   sent to you.

                                                                  8



         1       Q.  Let me ask some questions.  I pass you

         2   what's been marked as Exhibit 1.  If you could

         3   just take a look at it, then let me know if you

         4   recognize it.

         5       A.  Yes, I received this (indicating).

         6       Q.  This is the subpoena you received to come

         7   her to testify today?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9       Q.  If you turn to page three of the

        10   subpoena.  Towards the bottom there is a header

        11   marked "Document Requests".  Do you see that?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13       Q.  Following that there are eight specific

        14   items identified.  Do you see those there?

        15       A.  Yes.

        16       Q.  Earlier you said that you brought some

        17   documents with you.  Are those documents

        18   responsive to the request contained in the

        19   subpoena?

        20       A.  Yes.  They are my entire file.

        21       Q.  Are these also the documents that you

        22   e-mailed to me earlier this month that I believe

        23   you previously sent to one of my colleagues

        24   Richard Briansky?

                                                                  9



         1       A.  Yes.  In addition I did just sign a

         2   contract with the adjuster George Butler for my

         3   time today.  We didn't have a contract

         4   previously.  That is included.

         5       Q.  Is that the only additional document

         6   that's included from the prior e-mail that you

         7   sent?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9       Q.  Can I take a look at the documents?

        10       A.  Sure.  All of them?

        11       Q.  Yes.  The additional documents you

        12   referenced, is it page two of the packet here

        13   with the date August 9, 2019 at the top?

        14       A.  Yes.

        15       Q.  In the RE lines it says "Letter Of

        16   Agreement"?

        17       A.  Yes.

        18               (Discussion off the record)

        19                (Exhibit 2 marked

        20                for identification)

        21                MS. HACKETT:  So for the record I

        22   have marked Exhibit 2, as Exhibit 2 the documents

        23   that Ms. Davey brought with her today.

        24       Q.  I think you said these are all your

                                                                 10



         1   documents related to the file?

         2       A.  Correct.

         3       Q.  So what do you mean by that?

         4       A.  There are any e-mails or correspondence

         5   that I received from the adjusters in relation to

         6   this case.

         7       Q.  Are there any e-mail correspondence with

         8   individuals other than the adjusters in this

         9   packet?

        10       A.  There might have been an e-mail to

        11   someone, I am not sure what the relationship was,

        12   asking for documents, construction documents or

        13   structural documents, that was somehow involved

        14   in this.  I am not sure what relation it was to

        15   the contractors or the other side.

        16       Q.  If I say the name Hugh Meehan, does that

        17   name ring a bell?

        18       A.  Yes.

        19       Q.  There may be e-mails with Hugh Meehan in

        20   addition to the adjusters?

        21       A.  Yes.  Correct.

        22       Q.  What type of search did you do to locate

        23   the documents?

        24       A.  I searched through my e-mail database and

                                                                 11



         1   the project folder.

         2       Q.  Did you say that you didn't have a

         3   contract until August of this year --

         4       A.  Correct.

         5       Q.  -- with the adjuster?

         6               (Discussion off the record)

         7                    (Exhibit 3 marked

         8                    for identification)

         9       Q.  You work at Thornton Tomasetti?

        10       A.  Correct.

        11       Q.  What are your responsibilities there?

        12       A.  I am a principal of Thornton Tomasetti.

        13   I am also co-office director for the Boston

        14   office and I lead a forensic practice in the

        15   Boston office.

        16       Q.  How long have you worked there?

        17       A.  19 years.

        18       Q.  Passing you what's been marked as

        19   Exhibit 3.  Take a look at it, let me know if you

        20   recognize it.

        21       A.  I have received this.

        22       Q.  Exhibit 3 is a subpoena issued to the

        23   keeper of records of Thornton Tomasetti.  You see

        24   that on the first page?

                                                                 12



         1       A.  Yes.

         2       Q.  You said that you received this

         3   previously?

         4       A.  Yes.

         5       Q.  Did you previously produce by e-mail

         6   documents responsive to this subpoena?

         7       A.  Yes.

         8       Q.  Those documents are the same documents

         9   that you brought here today with the exception of

        10   that additional agreement; is that right?

        11       A.  Correct.

        12       Q.  Did you do anything to prepare for the

        13   deposition today?

        14       A.  I printed the documents and skimmed them

        15   again.

        16       Q.  Did you talk with anybody before today's

        17   deposition concerning the deposition?

        18       A.  No.  Other than Paul Battaglino, who I

        19   requested the contract from so my time could be

        20   paid today.

        21       Q.  What did you and he discuss, was it

        22   simply --

        23       A.  It was just via e-mail.  It was the

        24   contract.

                                                                 13



         1       Q.  Did you discuss the substance of any

         2   potential testimony?

         3       A.  No.

         4       Q.  You mentioned Paul Battaglino, who is he?

         5       A.  He is the adjuster for George Butler

         6   Associates.

         7       Q.  How are you familiar with him?

         8       A.  He reached out and contacted me saying

         9   that he represented Lloyd's London and that they

        10   were looking to hire an expert to assist in his

        11   claim.

        12       Q.  When was that?

        13       A.  You just took all my documents.  2018, I

        14   believe.

        15       Q.  Would you need to look at the documents

        16   to refresh your memory as to when that was?

        17       A.  Yes.

        18                    (Exhibit 4 marked

        19                    for identification)

        20       Q.  I am passing what's been marked Exhibit 4

        21   and let me know if that refreshes your

        22   recollection as to when Mr. Battaglino reached

        23   out to you?

        24       A.  Yes.

                                                                 14



         1       Q.  Did he reach out on July 17th of 2018?

         2       A.  Correct.

         3       Q.  Is this the first time you ever

         4   communicated with him?

         5       A.  I believe so.

         6       Q.  Was this the first project that you were

         7   retained to work on on behalf of Lloyd's London

         8   or had you done previous work with them?

         9       A.  Personally I have not worked with them

        10   before.

        11       Q.  After you received this e-mail from

        12   Mr. Battaglino, did you have a telephone

        13   conversation with him?

        14       A.  Yes.

        15       Q.  When was that?

        16       A.  Probably shortly after this e-mail.

        17       Q.  What did you discuss?

        18       A.  We would have discussed a little bit

        19   about this case, what had happened at the

        20   building and what he was looking for.

        21       Q.  What was your understanding from that

        22   conversation about what had happened and what the

        23   scope of the project or assignment was for you?

        24       A.  Sure.  I understood that there was a

                                                                 15



         1   personal building, collapse at a building that

         2   was under renovation.  Mr. Battaglino was looking

         3   for a structural engineering expert to give their

         4   opinion on the cause of the collapse.

         5       Q.  After your call, Mr. Battaglino provided

         6   you some information and summarized the scope of

         7   the assignment by e-mail, did he not?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9                    (Exhibit 5 marked

        10                    for identification)

        11       Q.  Have you previously been retained to

        12   opine on the cause of a collapse of a structure?

        13       A.  Collapse, I don't think on a collapse.

        14       Q.  You hesitated.

        15       A.  Because I am trying to think through all

        16   of the cases I have ever had.

        17       Q.  Okay.  But to the best of your

        18   recollection this was the first time you were

        19   asked to provide an opinion on the cause of the

        20   collapse of the building?

        21       A.  Yes.  I have worked on a team that

        22   investigated the cause of a bridge collapse but I

        23   was not the one that, that was the testifying

        24   expert.

                                                                 16



         1       Q.  What was your role in that investigation?

         2       A.  Doing some structural calculations.

         3       Q.  I am going to pass you what's been marked

         4   as Exhibit 5.  If you could take a look at it.

         5   Let me know if you recognize it.

         6       A.  Yes.

         7       Q.  This is an e-mail from Mr. Battaglino to

         8   you dated July 18th, correct?

         9       A.  Correct.

        10       Q.  In the e-mail he is identifying the scope

        11   of the assignment in the middle of the page?

        12       A.  Correct.

        13       Q.  You see sub 2 there?

        14       A.  Yes.

        15       Q.  What did you understand him to be asking

        16   or asking you to opine on?

        17       A.  From what I understand, the building with

        18   the partial collapse shared a party wall with an

        19   adjacent building and he was asking for my

        20   opinion as to whether the adjacent building

        21   needed to be demolished as a result of the

        22   partial collapse.

        23       Q.  Meaning -- because the other building was

        24   also -- the structural integrity of the other

                                                                 17



         1   building was also compromised or --

         2       A.  Yes.

         3       Q.  Then number 3, what did you understand

         4   him to be asking you to do in sub 3?

         5       A.  I understood it that I would be receiving

         6   some perhaps shoring or demo calculations or

         7   plans from the subcontractor that he wanted me to

         8   review and to opine whether these means and

         9   methods were standard and safe for this work.

        10       Q.  Can you describe what a standard mean of

        11   method for this type of demotion would be or is

        12   it specific to the building that's being

        13   demolished?

        14                MS. SEARS:  Objection.  Go ahead.

        15       A.  It would be specific to the work that was

        16   being done on the building.

        17       Q.  Down further you see the paragraph that

        18   starts "As I mentioned"?

        19       A.  Yes.

        20       Q.  "Once you have had a chance to review,

        21   please send us an email with the information you

        22   require from the insured so that we can submit to

        23   the PA and insured".  Do you see that?

        24       A.  Yes.

                                                                 18



         1       Q.  Did you identify for Mr. Battaglino the

         2   information that you would need in order to

         3   render an opinion?

         4       A.  Yes.

         5       Q.  When did you do that?

         6       A.  It was a subsequent e-mail.

         7       Q.  So you did that by e-mail, not by

         8   telephone?

         9       A.  Correct.

        10                    (Exhibit 6 marked

        11                    for identification)

        12       Q.  I pass you what's been marked Exhibit 6.

        13   Take a moment to look at it.  Let me know if you

        14   recognize it.

        15       A.  Yes, I recognize it.

        16       Q.  What do you recognize it to be?

        17       A.  I recognize it as my e-mail to Paul and

        18   Colm O'Neill with a list of information that I

        19   was seeking to render my opinion.

        20       Q.  Is this the first time you identified the

        21   specific information that you would need in order

        22   to render your opinion?

        23       A.  Yes.

        24       Q.  Who is Colm O'Neill?

                                                                 19



         1       A.  I believe he was a third-party adjuster.

         2       Q.  Before we get to this e-mail.  Did you

         3   ever discuss with Mr. Battaglino or with

         4   Mr. O'Neill any request they had made to Lloyd's

         5   to retain you?

         6       A.  No.

         7       Q.  Turning to Exhibit 6.  You identified

         8   seven sets of documents that you -- or

         9   information that you needed there?

        10       A.  Correct.

        11       Q.  Do you see that?  I want to walk through

        12   each one of those.  So the first one says

        13   "Construction Documents and Specifications both

        14   architectural and Structural drawings.  Clara

        15   contract states the drawings are dated May 1,

        16   2017".  Explain specifically what you are looking

        17   for and why you need it to determine the cause of

        18   the loss?

        19       A.  I am looking for the construction

        20   documents that they were building from, both the

        21   architectural and structural drawings so that I

        22   could see what structural modifications were

        23   required in the building.  Also any

        24   specifications that talk about how the work

                                                                 20



         1   should be done or the type of materials that

         2   should be used for the work.  I believe one of

         3   the contracts had referenced these drawings and

         4   stated that they were dated the May 1, 2017.

         5       Q.  Why are those types of documents needed?

         6   Why were those types of documents needed in this

         7   case to determine the cause of the loss?

         8       A.  I needed to understand what the

         9   structural system of the building was, as I

        10   believe it had been demolished prior to my

        11   involvement.

        12       Q.  Number 2, you identify demolition plans.

        13   What specifically are you looking for there?

        14       A.  I am looking for any plans that were

        15   prepared either by the structural engineer of

        16   record or perhaps the demolition contractor

        17   showing exactly what structural elements were

        18   going to be demolished.

        19       Q.  Why is that necessary to determine the

        20   cause of the collapse?

        21       A.  Because depending on what they demolished

        22   or how much they demolished might make some other

        23   structural elements unstable.

        24       Q.  In sub 3 it says "Temporary stabilization

                                                                 21



         1   plans, means and methods or work procedures by

         2   demo contractor".  Do you see that there?

         3       A.  Yes.

         4       Q.  What specifically were you looking for?

         5       A.  I was looking for any plans by the

         6   demolition contractor that showed how they would

         7   keep the building stable and safe during the

         8   demolition of structural elements.

         9       Q.  Why is that necessary to determine the

        10   cause of the collapse?

        11       A.  If they did not provide temporary shoring

        12   in some instances it may cause an instability in

        13   the structure.  Actually cause the collapse.

        14       Q.  Can you describe what temporary shoring

        15   is?

        16       A.  For example, if you have a beam that is

        17   supported from one wall to the other wall and you

        18   need to cut that beam to put an opening in the

        19   floor, you would need to temporarily support the

        20   end of the beam that is cut and no longer

        21   supported on this wall until a permanent member

        22   is put in place to support the end.

        23       Q.  Number 4 it says "calculations for temp.

        24   conditions and final/permanent conditions".  What

                                                                 22



         1   were you looking for there?

         2       A.  I was looking for any temporary

         3   calculations that the demo contractor may have

         4   done to show that the shoring would provide the

         5   stability and had the load-bearing capacity it

         6   needed to stabilize the structure.

         7       Q.  How does that differ from final permanent

         8   conditions?

         9       A.  The final permanent conditions is more

        10   showing what the building -- what the structural

        11   engineer of record would have designed the

        12   building to, the wind loads, seismic loads.

        13       Q.  For the fully constructed building?

        14       A.  Yes.

        15       Q.  Why is that information needed or why was

        16   that information needed to determine the cause of

        17   the collapse?

        18       A.  I needed to know what building code that

        19   was following, what design loads they were

        20   designing for, so that I could see what the

        21   temporary condition loads needed to be for the

        22   shoring design.

        23       Q.  Number 5 it says "Any changes to the

        24   construction documents or demolition plans".

                                                                 23



         1   What specifically were you looking for?

         2       A.  I was looking for any changes, bulletins,

         3   amendments to the contract drawings, the original

         4   contract drawings, which I believe would have

         5   been that May 1, 2017.

         6       Q.  Why was that information necessary to

         7   determine the cause of the collapse?

         8       A.  Because sometimes during construction the

         9   owner may change their mind or design element

        10   changes and the plans that are first filed with

        11   the city are updated for that change in order to

        12   have the most current plans.

        13       Q.  So you were looking for number 1 in the

        14   original plan and number 5 for any changes to

        15   those plans so you could see what work was

        16   actually being performed at the time of the

        17   collapse?

        18       A.  Correct.

        19       Q.  Number 6 it says "Any photos taken during

        20   construction or after the collapse".  That seems

        21   pretty self-explanatory.  Why was that necessary

        22   to determine the cause of the collapse?

        23       A.  As I said before, I believe that the

        24   building had been demolished prior to my

                                                                 24



         1   involvement, so I was looking for a visual

         2   representation of what was out there since I

         3   could not go out and see the building myself.

         4       Q.  Then number 7 says "inspection reports

         5   written during construction".  What specifically

         6   were you looking for?

         7       A.  Generally during construction the

         8   building code requires certain elements of

         9   construction to be inspected.  I was looking for

        10   those inspection reports.

        11       Q.  Why would those be necessary to determine

        12   the cause of the collapse?

        13       A.  Their inspection reports should note if

        14   there are any deviations from code or the plans.

        15   I was looking to see if there were any

        16   deviations.

        17       Q.  Before you sent this e-mail you had

        18   received some documents from Mr. Battaglino and

        19   Mr. O'Neill, correct?

        20       A.  Correct.

        21                    (Exhibits 7-8 marked

        22                    for identification)

        23       Q.  Before I turn to these documents, of the

        24   seven items that you identified in Exhibit 6,

                                                                 25



         1   would it have been possible to determine the

         2   cause of the loss without receiving any of those

         3   sets of documents?

         4       A.  Do you mean if I received partial of

         5   these documents would I have been able?

         6       Q.  For example, if you received 1 through 6

         7   but you didn't receive number 7, could you have

         8   determined the cause of the loss?

         9       A.  Yes.

        10       Q.  Let me walk through that more

        11   specifically.  If you had not received the

        12   documents contained in item 1, would you have

        13   been able to determine the cause of the loss?

        14                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        15       Q.  You can answer unless you need me to

        16   clarify.  I can ask it again.

        17       A.  Okay.

        18       Q.  Could you have determined the cause of

        19   the loss without receiving the documents

        20   identified in number 1?

        21                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        22       A.  If I had seen demolition drawings and I

        23   had seen temporary stabilization plans or the

        24   means and methods or work procedures by the demo

                                                                 26



         1   contractor in item 3, together with some photos,

         2   I probably could render an opinion.

         3               (Discussion off the record)

         4       Q.  Of the seven documents, set of documents

         5   identified there, were any of them absolutely

         6   necessary to determine the cause of the collapse?

         7                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

         8       A.  That's hard to say without having seen

         9   the contents of all those documents.

        10       Q.  You testified that before you sent this

        11   list you had received some documents from the

        12   adjusters.  I am going to pass you both Exhibit 7

        13   and Exhibit 8.  Ask you to go ahead and take a

        14   look at the e-mails and the supporting documents.

        15   Let me know if you recognize them.

        16                MS. SEARS:  Which one is 7 and which

        17   one is 8?

        18                MS. HACKETT:  7 is the July 18th

        19   e-mail and 8 is the August 25th e-mail.

        20       A.  Yes, I have seen these.

        21       Q.  Let's start with Exhibit 7.  Exhibit 7 is

        22   an e-mail dated July 18th from Mr. Battaglino to

        23   you.  Do you see that there?

        24       A.  Yes.

                                                                 27



         1       Q.  In this e-mail Mr. Battaglino is

         2   attaching some subcontracts and notices from the

         3   City of Boston.  Do you see that there?

         4       A.  Yes.

         5       Q.  In the e-mail he also asks you let him

         6   know if you need any additional information.  You

         7   see that?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9       Q.  Any additional information you requested

        10   was in the August 27th e-mail identified as

        11   Exhibit 6?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13       Q.  Is that right?

        14       A.  Yes.

        15       Q.  Then turning to Exhibit 8, that's an

        16   e-mail dated August 25th from Mr. O'Neill to you

        17   and Mr. Battaglino.  Do you see that there?

        18       A.  Yes.

        19       Q.  In that, attached to that e-mail are a

        20   series of documents, contracts, and other

        21   documents; is that right?

        22       A.  Correct.

        23       Q.  These are the documents you received

        24   before you made the list in Exhibit 6, correct?

                                                                 28



         1       A.  Correct.

         2       Q.  Did you reach out directly to the insured

         3   to request these documents that you identified?

         4       A.  I reached out to Mr. Meehan directly.

         5       Q.  When was that?

         6       A.  Again, it was around this timeframe.  I

         7   don't remember the exact date.

         8       Q.  Did you ever speak to Mr. Meehan by

         9   telephone?

        10       A.  No.

        11       Q.  Any request you made would have been by

        12   e-mail?

        13       A.  Yes.

        14       Q.  That e-mail would be contained in the

        15   documents you brought which are Exhibit 2?

        16       A.  Yes.

        17                    (Exhibit 9 marked

        18                    for identification)

        19       Q.  I am going to pass you what's been marked

        20   Exhibit 9.  Ask you to take a look at it and let

        21   me know if you recognize it.

        22       A.  Yes, I recognize it.

        23       Q.  This is an e-mail chain and the latest

        24   date is September 6, 2018.  Do you see that at

                                                                 29



         1   the top?

         2       A.  Yes.

         3       Q.  I am going to ask you to turn to the very

         4   top of page two.  It is a forward of an e-mail

         5   dated September 4th.  See that there?

         6       A.  Yes.

         7       Q.  This is an e-mail from Colm O'Neill to

         8   says "Hugh" at the top.  Do you see that?

         9       A.  Yes.

        10       Q.  The e-mail is identifying the information

        11   you had requested.  Is that right?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13       Q.  Are you aware as to whether -- strike

        14   that.  To your knowledge is this the first

        15   request made to Hugh for these documents?

        16       A.  I believe so that I am aware of.

        17                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        18       Q.  Who did you understand Hugh Meehan to be?

        19       A.  I believe he worked for a Alaris

        20   Construction, which I think was the general

        21   contractor.

        22               (Exhibit 10 marked

        23                for identification)

        24       Q.  I pass you what has been marked

                                                                 30



         1   Exhibit 10.  Take a look at it and let me know if

         2   you recognize it.

         3       A.  Yes.

         4       Q.  This is a further e-mail chain, a

         5   continuation of the prior e-mail.  The date on

         6   the top of this one is November 8, 2018.  Do you

         7   see that there?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9       Q.  So I am just going to ask you to turn to

        10   page 2.  At the bottom is that September 4th

        11   e-mail to Hugh Meehan.  Do you see that there?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13       Q.  Then turn back to page 1, please.  At the

        14   bottom of that, of page 1, is an e-mail dated

        15   October 11th from Mr. O'Neill.  Do you see that

        16   there?

        17       A.  Yes.

        18       Q.  In that e-mail he is asking you if you

        19   had received any of the information.  Is that

        20   right?

        21       A.  Correct.

        22       Q.  As of that date had you received any

        23   information?

        24       A.  No.

                                                                 31



         1       Q.  Between September 4th when the documents

         2   were initially requested of Hugh Meehan, did you

         3   reach out to Mr. Meehan or follow up with him

         4   yourself?

         5       A.  I feel like I sent an e-mail but I don't

         6   exactly remember.  I believe that Colm or Paul

         7   asked me to reach out directly.

         8       Q.  Then you respond on October 11th to

         9   Mr. Meehan, "No I never received the documents".

        10   Do you see that?

        11       A.  Yes.

        12       Q.  Then there is another e-mail from

        13   Mr. Battaglino and a response from you dated

        14   November 8th.  Do you see that?

        15       A.  Yes.

        16       Q.  It starts with "I got your voicemail last

        17   week"?

        18       A.  Yes.

        19       Q.  Do you recall what the content of that

        20   voicemail was or why Mr. Battaglino was calling

        21   you?

        22       A.  I do not.

        23       Q.  In that e-mail you say to him that "I

        24   have not received any information.  I can reach

                                                                 32



         1   out again".  Do you see that there?

         2       A.  Yes.

         3       Q.  Between October 11th and November 8th you

         4   hadn't received any initial information from

         5   anyone; is that fair?

         6       A.  Correct.

         7       Q.  To your recollection did you individually

         8   reach out to Mr. Meehan during that time period?

         9       A.  I believe I did.  It would be in the

        10   documents I brought with me.

        11                (Exhibit 11 marked

        12                for identification)

        13       Q.  I pass you what's been marked as

        14   Exhibit 11 and ask you to take a look at it and

        15   see if you recognize it.

        16       A.  Yes.

        17       Q.  November 16th e-mail from you to H.

        18   Meehan.  Do you see that?

        19       A.  Yes.

        20       Q.  Is this the e-mail you were referring to

        21   in your testimony?

        22       A.  Yes.  Yes.

        23       Q.  By this e-mail you are following up with

        24   your information request, is that fair?

                                                                 33



         1       A.  Yes.

         2       Q.  You again identify the documents you are

         3   looking for?

         4       A.  Correct.

         5       Q.  Do you know whether Mr. Battaglino or

         6   Mr. O'Neill had separately reached out to Hugh

         7   Meehan between September 4th and November 16th?

         8       A.  I do not know.

         9       Q.  At some point Mr. Battaglino or

        10   Mr. O'Neill sent you some additional information

        11   concerning the collapse, right?

        12       A.  Yes.

        13                    (Exhibit 12 marked

        14                    for identification)

        15       Q.  I pass you what's been marked as

        16   Exhibit 12.  Take a look at it.  Do you recognize

        17   it?

        18       A.  Yes, I recognize it.

        19       Q.  E-mail dated November 14th from

        20   Mr. Battaglino to you and attaching some

        21   photographs.  You see that?

        22       A.  Yes.

        23       Q.  Photographs is one of the things you

        24   previously requested, correct?

                                                                 34



         1       A.  Correct.

         2       Q.  Did you ever talk with Mr. Battaglino

         3   about he or Mr. O'Neill or Lloyd's London

         4   reaching out directly to OSHA or the City of

         5   Boston to obtain some of the documents you were

         6   looking for?

         7       A.  I don't recall actually.

         8       Q.  So in this e-mail Mr. Battaglino is

         9   attaching, as he says, "some photos from OSHA --

        10       A.  Yes.

        11       Q.  -- of the loss location prior to the

        12   actual collapse."  Do you see that there?

        13       A.  Yes.

        14       Q.  Did you review these photographs?

        15       A.  Yes.

        16       Q.  When they came in?

        17       A.  Yes.

        18       Q.  He is asking you in the next paragraph to

        19   look at some specific photographs.  Do you see

        20   that there?

        21       A.  Yes.

        22       Q.  He identifies, he believes there to be

        23   large cracks along the rear of the wall?

        24       A.  Correct.

                                                                 35



         1       Q.  You see that?

         2       A.  Yes.

         3       Q.  And he asks you a question.  He says

         4   "Based on these photos can you tell if the wall

         5   was in an immanent state of collapse and is this

         6   something a General Contractor should have

         7   noticed and attempted to repair".  Do you see

         8   that there?

         9       A.  Yes.

        10       Q.  Did you respond to him?

        11       A.  We may have had a phone conversation but

        12   nothing in writing to my knowledge.

        13       Q.  What is the answer to that question?

        14       A.  Based on those cracks it is something of

        15   concern that a contractor should have been

        16   alarmed by.

        17       Q.  Do those photos assist you in opining on

        18   the cause of the collapse?

        19       A.  It is showing that there is definitely

        20   some structural instability that in some way the

        21   building is experiencing instability and

        22   difficulty but as to the exact reason as to why

        23   these cracks are showing up, it is not evident

        24   from these photos.

                                                                 36



         1       Q.  What would you need to determine the

         2   reason for the cracks on the wall?

         3       A.  Again, I would have liked to have had a

         4   plan of what work was going on inside the

         5   building.

         6       Q.  Why would you want the plan?

         7       A.  I would want to see if the building, the

         8   floor framing was tied into the wall or whether

         9   this wall was free-standing for multiple stories.

        10       Q.  How would that assist you in rendering an

        11   opinion?

        12       A.  These walls generally are not designed to

        13   free-stand multiple stories, so framing say at

        14   the second story had been removed and it was

        15   spanning from the first story to the third story,

        16   the wall would be potentially unstable.

        17       Q.  If there had been floor framing on each

        18   floor, for example, would that have changed

        19   your --

        20       A.  Then there may have been another cause

        21   that I would have to investigate.

        22       Q.  Just to go back, I think your testimony

        23   was that you may have had a conversation with

        24   Mr. Battaglino but you couldn't recall?

                                                                 37



         1       A.  I can't recall.

         2       Q.  Then in the next paragraph down he says

         3   "The building that partially collapsed shared a

         4   firewall with the adjoining building.  This

         5   adjoining building did not collapse, however, it

         6   was ordered to be taken down as well.  Can you

         7   offer your position as to whether or not a

         8   building, with a shared firewall, can be properly

         9   removed without affecting the adjoining

        10   building".  Did you respond to that question?

        11       A.  I would need more information as to,

        12   again, as to the framing of each of the

        13   buildings.

        14       Q.  Would that information be contained in

        15   the plans?

        16       A.  Yes.

        17       Q.  Do you recall whether you responded to

        18   Mr. Battaglino's question?

        19       A.  Again, I don't recall.

        20       Q.  The next paragraph he says "At this point

        21   we are not looking for a full blown report but

        22   just your professional opinion on the questions

        23   above".  Did you provide him with an opinion?

        24       A.  Not a written opinion, no.

                                                                 38



         1       Q.  What about a verbal opinion?

         2       A.  Again, I don't recall a conversation.

         3                    (Exhibit 13 marked

         4                    for identification)

         5       Q.  Mr. Battaglino also provided you some

         6   additional citations issued by the City of

         7   Boston, correct?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9       Q.  I ask you to look at Exhibit 13, then let

        10   me know if you recognize it.

        11       A.  Yes.

        12       Q.  This is an e-mail dated November 14th and

        13   in it -- to you from Mr. Battaglino -- and in it

        14   he says "Along with the photos we also received

        15   the attached citations for the loss location.

        16   One set is for Alaris Construction who was the

        17   General Contractor.  The other is for Greenshield

        18   Painting who was the Demolition contractor".

        19           Did you review the citations attached to

        20   the e-mail?

        21       A.  Yes.

        22       Q.  Did this additional information help you

        23   to opine as to the cause of the collapse?

        24       A.  I believe there was Citation 1, Item 10

                                                                 39



         1   that --

         2       Q.  Tell me where you are.

         3       A.  Let me find it first.  It says Page 15 of

         4   17 on the bottom.  Citation 1, Item 10.

         5       Q.  I am with you.

         6       A.  So it says "Wall sections more than one

         7   story in height were permitted to stand alone

         8   without lateral bracing when the wall section was

         9   not originally designed to stand alone without

        10   such lateral supports".  This appears to

        11   correspond to some of the photos that were sent

        12   in the previous e-mail.

        13       Q.  How so?  You are referring to Exhibit 12,

        14   is that right?

        15       A.  Correct.  So in photo 18.

        16       Q.  Photo 18, okay.

        17       A.  You can see at the bottom of the photo

        18   pockets, the beam pockets in the wall where the

        19   beams have been removed.  You also see it in

        20   photo 20.  And photo 22.  Photo 23.  I believe

        21   that's it.

        22       Q.  You said that corresponds to the Citation

        23   1, Item 10?

        24       A.  Yes, it appears to be what they are

                                                                 40



         1   referring to.

         2       Q.  That there was no lateral support?

         3       A.  Correct.

         4       Q.  Does that indicate to you that there was

         5   something improper about the method or the means

         6   of construction?

         7                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

         8       A.  I do not see from these photographs any

         9   temporary means of stabilization of this wall

        10   preventing it from being a two-story free-

        11   standing wall.

        12       Q.  How would that -- strike that.

        13           Could the failure of or could the lack of

        14   the lateral support have caused the collapse?

        15       A.  Yes.

        16       Q.  In your opinion was that lack of lateral

        17   support the cause of the cracks along the rear

        18   exterior wall?

        19                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        20       A.  Again, without having a little more

        21   substance from the plans, I cannot say.  It could

        22   be a contributing factor.

        23       Q.  Were there any other citations contained

        24   in Exhibit 13 which assisted you in developing an

                                                                 41



         1   opinion?  I understand you didn't render one.

         2       A.  I believe that was the only item in the

         3   citation that had to do with structural

         4   stability.

         5                    (Exhibit 14 marked

         6                    for identification)

         7       Q.  I am going to pass you Exhibit 14.  I ask

         8   you to take a look at it and let me know if you

         9   recognize it.

        10       A.  Yes.

        11       Q.  This is an e-mail chain between you and

        12   Mr. Battaglino and Mr. O'Neill and the latest

        13   date on the top is November 16, 2018 at

        14   11:07 a.m.  Do you see that?

        15       A.  Correct.

        16       Q.  By the time of these e-mails had you

        17   received the additional photos from OSHA and the

        18   additional citations, correct?

        19       A.  Correct.

        20       Q.  Towards the bottom of that e-mail

        21   Mr. Battaglino is asking you if you are able to

        22   provide some sort of response and when you could

        23   expect it.  Do you see that there?

        24       A.  Yes.

                                                                 42



         1       Q.  Then in your response to him you say "I

         2   really don't have any information to go by.  I

         3   need drawings to see what work was being done.

         4   By looking at the photos it appears as if there

         5   was a masonry wall that was unbraced for a couple

         6   of stories.  This seems to be similar to one of

         7   the violation notices too.  You can see the beam

         8   pockets but no new framing or bracing of that

         9   wall".

        10           Do you see that?

        11       A.  Yes.

        12       Q.  Is that what you were previously

        13   testifying to a few minutes ago?

        14       A.  Correct.

        15       Q.  At this point is the only additional

        16   information you needed to opine on the cause of

        17   the collapse the drawings?

        18                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        19       A.  Probably.

        20       Q.  Why do you say probably?

        21       A.  Again, without seeing the content of

        22   those drawings I can't definitively say, yes,

        23   they would have been helpful or, no, they weren't

        24   helpful.

                                                                 43



         1               (Exhibit 15 marked

         2                for identification)

         3       Q.  I am going to pass you what's been marked

         4   as Exhibit 15.  Let me know if you recognize it.

         5       A.  Yes.

         6       Q.  Was your answer yes?

         7       A.  Yes.

         8       Q.  This is an e-mail from Battaglino to you

         9   November 16th at noon.  Do you see that there?

        10       A.  Yes.

        11       Q.  He is attaching a document which is

        12   entitled "E-4 Winthrop Marked Up drawings".  Do

        13   you see that?

        14       A.  Yes.

        15       Q.  Were these the drawings that you had been

        16   requesting?

        17       A.  These are the architectural drawings.

        18   They do not include the structural drawings or

        19   any demolition drawings or any shoring drawings

        20   produced by the contractor.

        21       Q.  Do these drawings assist you in

        22   determining the cause of the collapse?

        23       A.  They assist me in understanding what the

        24   scope of the work was.  But from these drawings I

                                                                 44



         1   can't determine the cause of the collapse.

         2       Q.  Do these drawings provide you any

         3   additional information about the lateral support

         4   for the building during the course of the

         5   demolition?

         6       A.  No.

         7                    (Exhibit 16 marked

         8                    for identification)

         9       Q.  I am passing you what's marked

        10   Exhibit 16.  I ask you to take a look at it and

        11   let me know if you recognize it.

        12       A.  Yes, I recognize it.

        13       Q.  This is another e-mail chain, the latest

        14   date and time is November 16, 2018 at 1:30 p.m.

        15   It is from you to Mr. Battaglino and Mr. O'Neill.

        16   Do you see that there?

        17       A.  Yes.

        18       Q.  The e-mail right before that at 1:29 p.m.

        19   is from Mr. Battaglino.  Do you see that there?

        20       A.  Yes.

        21       Q.  This is approximately an hour and a half

        22   after he sent you the architectural drawings?

        23       A.  Yes.

        24       Q.  He says in this e-mail "I just spoke with

                                                                 45



         1   the attorney for Lloyds (sic.) on the property

         2   side of this.  At this point, we don't need any

         3   additional engineering services".

         4           Did you have any verbal communications

         5   with Mr. Battaglino about why they were no longer

         6   in need of your services?

         7       A.  No.

         8       Q.  Did you have any conversations with

         9   Mr. Battaglino about whether Lloyd's agreed to

        10   cover the loss?

        11       A.  No.

        12                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        13       Q.  Did you have any conversations with him

        14   about whether there was insurance coverage for

        15   the collapse?

        16       A.  No.

        17       Q.  Did you have any telephone conversation

        18   with him around this time or were your

        19   communications confined to e-mail?

        20                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        21       A.  Just e-mail, I believe.

        22       Q.  Do you know why they no longer were in

        23   need of your services as of November 16?

        24       A.  No.

                                                                 46



         1       Q.  I think you said that you hadn't signed a

         2   contract with them until this week?

         3       A.  Correct.

         4       Q.  Did they ever pay you for any of the work

         5   you did?

         6       A.  No.

         7                    (Exhibit 17 marked

         8                    for identification)

         9       Q.  I will pass you what's been marked

        10   Exhibit 17.  You just take a look at it.  Let me

        11   know if you recognize it.

        12       A.  Yes, I recognize it.

        13       Q.  This is also an e-mail chain, this time

        14   between you and Mr. O'Neill.  Do you see that

        15   there?

        16       A.  Yes.

        17       Q.  The latest e-mail is dated December 15th

        18   (sic.)?

        19       A.  Yes.  December 5th.

        20       Q.  I am sorry.  Yes.  December 5th of 2018.

        21           In the e-mail from Mr. O'Neill he says "I

        22   am seeking further Instructions on this from

        23   Underwriters.  We have received contracts that

        24   provide an Indemnity to Winthrop Maverick by

                                                                 47



         1   Alaris Construction.  Please place your file on

         2   hold pending further instructions".  Do you see

         3   that?

         4       A.  Yes.

         5       Q.  Did you have any verbal communication

         6   with Mr. Battaglino or O'Neill concerning this

         7   e-mail?

         8       A.  No.

         9       Q.  What did you understand him to mean?

        10       A.  I didn't really think about what it

        11   means.  I just assumed that the insurance was

        12   working itself out and I was not going to work on

        13   it any more.

        14       Q.  Did you have any communications with

        15   Mr. O'Neill or Mr. Battaglino after December 5th?

        16       A.  Not until I received the subpoenas for

        17   all my records.

        18       Q.  So in this e-mail he asked you to place

        19   your file on hold.  They did not ask you to

        20   reopen the file.  Is that fair?

        21       A.  Correct.

        22       Q.  Are you performing any services related

        23   to this collapse on behalf of George Butler

        24   Adjuster or Lloyd's other than being paid for

                                                                 48



         1   your time here today?

         2       A.  No.

         3               (Recess taken)

         4      BY MS. HACKETT:

         5       Q.  Did you review or were you provided with

         6   videos of any media coverage --

         7       A.  No.

         8       Q.  -- related to the collapse?

         9       A.  No.

        10       Q.  Would it have been helpful for you to

        11   review any videos that showed either the partial

        12   collapse or the complete demolition of the

        13   buildings?

        14                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        15       A.  Perhaps.

        16       Q.  Based on what you were provided with,

        17   what other potential causes aside from methods of

        18   construction could have caused the collapse?

        19                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

        20       A.  I am not sure.  I am not sure about the

        21   question.  Something else other than construction

        22   that could have caused the collapse?

        23       Q.  Other than improper method of

        24   construction or demolition, aside from that, is

                                                                 49



         1   there something else that could have caused the

         2   collapse in this case?

         3                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

         4       A.  I don't think I can answer that.

         5       Q.  Let me ask you some background questions.

         6       A.  Sure.

         7       Q.  You are an engineer?

         8       A.  Yes.

         9       Q.  When did you graduate -- sorry.

        10           Can you tell me about your educational

        11   background?

        12       A.  Sure.  I received a bachelors of science

        13   in civil engineering from Union College in

        14   Schenectady, New York in 1996.  I then went to

        15   work for the Electric Boat Corporation in Groton,

        16   Connecticut doing underwater shock and vibration

        17   analysis of submarines.  I was there for two

        18   years, left.  Went back to graduate school full

        19   time at Tufts University.  Finished in 2000, I

        20   believe, with a masters of science in structural

        21   engineering.

        22           Then went to work with Thornton

        23   Tomasetti.

        24       Q.  Have you been there since?

                                                                 50



         1       A.  Yes.

         2       Q.  Have you been retained as an expert in

         3   connection with litigation?

         4       A.  Yes.

         5       Q.  Tell me about your expert, your history

         6   as an expert witness.

         7                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

         8       A.  Just a few cases.

         9       Q.  About how many cases have you been

        10   retained as an expert witness in?

        11       A.  Many.  I can't count.

        12       Q.  More than ten?

        13       A.  Yes.

        14       Q.  More than 25?

        15       A.  As the testifying expert or involved in

        16   investigating for somebody else?

        17       Q.  Sure.  Let's start with testifying.  Have

        18   you ever been a testifying expert?

        19       A.  Yes.

        20       Q.  How many cases have you been the

        21   testifying expert?

        22       A.  Maybe around a dozen.

        23       Q.  You have also been retained as an expert

        24   in connection with litigation where you didn't

                                                                 51



         1   testify?

         2       A.  Yes.

         3       Q.  Is that true?

         4       A.  Correct.

         5       Q.  Approximately generally how many other

         6   cases, aside from when you testified, have you

         7   been retained as an expert?

         8       A.  Many.  It is the whole 19 years.

         9       Q.  Providing expert investigation analysis

        10   and testimony, is that part of your job?

        11       A.  Yes.

        12       Q.  How much of your work is devoted to

        13   expert -- strike that.

        14           How much of your work is devoted to

        15   investigating and claims and providing expert

        16   opinions in litigation?

        17       A.  It ebbs and flows.  Sometimes it is

        18   100 percent of my work.  Sometimes -- currently

        19   it is very small percentage of my work.  I am

        20   doing more design.  Structural design work.

        21       Q.  Are there other engineers at your firm

        22   who have provided opinions of the cause of

        23   building collapses?

        24       A.  Yes.

                                                                 52



         1       Q.  Who are those individuals?

         2       A.  My organization is 1,500 people.  Our

         3   forensics group is large.  I can get you a name

         4   of everybody in our forensics group but --

         5       Q.  Is there a typical process or procedure

         6   that you follow when you are retained to provide

         7   expert services?

         8       A.  Do you mean like a written policy within

         9   my company?

        10       Q.  No.  If someone sends you a project --

        11   strike that.

        12           You said this is the first time you have

        13   worked on or provided an opinion in connection

        14   with a collapse other than the bridge, is that

        15   right?

        16       A.  Correct.

        17               (Discussion off the record)

        18       A.  I just remembered that I did do a roof

        19   collapse on the Cape for I believe it was

        20   snowdrift loading overload that I had forgotten

        21   about.

        22       Q.  Let me ask you a question about that.  In

        23   that case were you asked to provide an opinion as

        24   to the cause of the collapse of the roof?

                                                                 53



         1       A.  Yes, I believe so.

         2       Q.  What was your opinion in that case, if

         3   you remember?

         4       A.  I believe they had built an adjacent

         5   building and did not check the existing roof for

         6   snowdrift load.

         7       Q.  How long?

         8                MS. SEARS:  Did you say you didn't

         9   check the what?

        10       A.  They did not check the snowdrift load.

        11   One roof was higher than the other, so the snow

        12   accumulates along that wall.

        13       Q.  About how long ago was that?

        14       A.  It was maybe two, three years ago.

        15       Q.  When you investigate a collapse, are

        16   there documents you typically request or does it

        17   depend on the type of collapse and the

        18   structural --

        19       A.  I always like to have the general

        20   structural drawings, if possible.

        21       Q.  Is there anything you would generally ask

        22   for?

        23       A.  If the building was under construction I

        24   would always ask for the plans showing the

                                                                 54



         1   modifications to the buildings, specifications,

         2   similar to the lists that I provided to

         3   Mr. O'Neill.

         4       Q.  What if structural drawings were not

         5   available for some reason, would you -- would

         6   that preclude you from issuing an opinion as to

         7   the cause of the collapse?

         8                MS. SEARS:  Objection.

         9       A.  Not necessarily.  If I am able to go out

        10   and view the building prior to its demolition.

        11       Q.  What if you were not able to view the

        12   building prior to the demolition, would those

        13   structural drawings be necessary to render an

        14   opinion?

        15       A.  It depends what we have in terms of other

        16   documents provided to us.  Other reports.

        17                MS. HACKETT:  Any questions?

        18                CROSS EXAMINATION

        19   BY MS. SEARS:

        20       Q.  Is it fair to say the documents you

        21   initially requested were a starting point,

        22   meaning once you got those documents there may

        23   have been other things that you would need?

        24       A.  Correct.

                                                                 55

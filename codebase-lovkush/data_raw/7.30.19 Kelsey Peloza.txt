          18          Q.    Good morning.  My name is

          19   Haley Welch, I represent the Defendants

          20   Marissa and Mindy in the lawsuit that you

          21   filed.  We're here today for your

          22   deposition.  Can you state your full name

          23   for the record?

          24          A.    Kelsey Peloza.

           1          Q.    All right.  Have you ever

           2   gone by any other names?

           3          A.    No.

           4          Q.    Have you ever had your

           5   deposition taken before?

           6          A.    No.

           7          Q.    So I'm going to go through a

           8   brief set of instructions, hopefully make

           9   the process go a little bit more smoothly

          10   today.  You just took an oath to tell the

          11   truth.  The even though we're in an

          12   informal setting here today, the oath you

          13   took is the same oath you would take in

          14   an actual courtroom.  Does that make

          15   sense?

          16          A.    Mhmm.

          17          Q.    Is that a yes?

          18          A.    Yes.

          19          Q.    So that's my next

          20   instruction, all of your answers need to

          21   be verbal.  We have a court reporter

          22   taking down everything we say, so even

          23   though I may understand when you say

          24   uh-huh and mhmm, they're written down the

           1   same on a transcript so it's not clear.

           2   And even though I may understand if you

           3   nod your head or shrug your shoulders,

           4   that also can't be written down on a

           5   transcript.

           6                So just make sure yes or no

           7   answers.  If you nod your head, shrug

           8   your shoulders, say uh-huh or mhmm, I

           9   will correct you.  I'm not trying to be

          10   rude, I'm just trying to make sure we get

          11   a clear record.  Okay?

          12          A.    Okay.

          13          Q.    If you don't understand any

          14   of my questions for any reason, just let

          15   me know.  I'll be happy to rephrase it,

          16   re-ask it to make sure you do understand

          17   the question.

          18                If you answer any of my

          19   questions, I'm going to assume, and our

          20   written record will reflect three things.

          21   First, that you heard the question,

          22   second that you understood the question,

          23   and third, that you answered the question

          24   truthfully.  Okay?

           1          A.    Okay.

           2          Q.    We're not here today for any

           3   guesses.  If you don't know something or

           4   you don't remember something, "I don't

           5   know," or "I don't remember," are

           6   perfectly acceptable answers, so long as

           7   that's the truth.

           8          A.    Okay.

           9          Q.    If you need to estimate or

          10   approximate anything like time, speed,

          11   distance, or date, that's fine, just let

          12   us know that you're estimating or

          13   approximating.  Okay?

          14          A.    Okay.

          15          Q.    Have you understood all of

          16   these instructions?

          17          A.    Yes.

          18          Q.    Are you on any medications

          19   that would prevent you from understanding

          20   or answering any of my questions?

          21          A.    No.

          22          Q.    Did you review any documents

          23   in preparation for today's deposition?

          24          A.    Yes.

           1          Q.    What documents did you

           2   review?

           3          A.    I don't know the specific

           4   names of the documents.

           5          Q.    Could you describe them?

           6   Did you look at a police report?

           7          A.    I did not look at it myself.

           8          Q.    Okay.  Just to clarify, I do

           9   not want to know anything that you and

          10   your attorney discussed.  I'm just asking

          11   did you look at any documents,

          12   photographs --

          13          A.    We looked at photographs,

          14   diagram.

          15          Q.    Okay.  And diagram, is that

          16   a map of the intersection?

          17          A.    Correct.

          18          Q.    What is your date of birth?

          19          A.    June 6th, 1990.

           7   to your attorney and I'm going to take a

          21          Q.    Does it sound correct that

          22   you started seeing Dr. Petrelli in July

          10   fist went to Dr. Petrelli on July 30th of

          11   2018, do you have any reason to disagree

          12   with those dates?

          14          Q.    Okay.  Is there a reason

          16   chiropractors in between October and

          17   July, October 2017 and July of 2018?

          18          A.    I can't remember if that's

          19   when I started physical therapy.

           4          Q.    Okay, all right.  Is there a

           7   therapy between October of 2017 and July

           8   of 2018?

           9          Q.    Okay.  And when you say that

          10   you were having numbness, was it that you

          11   couldn't feel your hands at all or was it

           2          Q.    Explain the test to me.

           3   What did they do?

           4          A.    They basically give you

           5   little electric shocks to test your

           6   nerves, and then they poke a needle in

           7   you.

           8          Q.    And you're pointing to your

           9   right arm, right?

          10          A.    No, not specifically.  I'm

          11   just telling you that they put it in your

          12   shoulder.

          13          Q.    Did they do it on both

          14   sides?

          15          A.    Yes, I think -- wait, I

          16   don't remember.

          17          Q.    Okay.  Was that test a

          18   painful process, did it hurt?

          19          A.    Oh, yeah, a lot.

          20          Q.    How long did the test last

          21   for?

          22          A.    I don't remember.

          23          Q.    Do you know the results of

          24   that test?

           8          Q.    What's the difference

           9   between them?

          10          A.    The nighttime splints are

          11   harder, more restrictive in movement, and

          12   the daytime splints have a little more

          13   give to them.

          14          Q.    The daytime splints, you

           8   it with Dr. Freed, it was discussed as a

          11          Q.    Did you ever discuss surgery

          15          A.    I don't.

          16          Q.    Was it in 2018 or 2019?

           6   zero to ten, zero being no pain at all,

           7   ten being the worst pain you can imagine?

           8   Let's start with the left side?

           9          A.    I mean, I honestly can't

          10   remember.

          11          Q.    Okay.  And could you tell me

          12   about the right side?

          22          A.    Less, but yes.

          23          Q.    Okay.  Immediately following

          24   the accident, were you experiencing neck

           2          A.    Yes.

           6          A.    It's daily.

           7          Q.    Are the pain levels lower

           8   now in 2019 than they were following the

           9   accident in 2017?

          10          A.    Yes.

          11          Q.    As we sit here in 2019, do

          12   you still ever have that numbness and

          13   tingling in your arms and hands?

          14          A.    That actually has gotten

          15   worse.

          16          Q.    And what do you mean when

          17   you say it's gotten worse?

          18          A.    Like I can feel it just

          19   sitting here without, you know,

          20   aggravating it with movement and stuff.

          21          Q.    Do you have the numbness and

           1   with after this accident ever prescribe

           2   you any medications?

           3          A.    I don't remember.  I think

           4   they all asked me if I wanted to take

           5   them, and I opted I wanted to do it

           6   without medicine.

           7          Q.    And why was that?

           8          A.    Because that's what I

           9   believe in.

          10          Q.    Okay.

          11          A.    And if I can get away

          19          Q.    Okay.  And when you say

          20   intermittently, how often would that be?

          21          A.    It's every couple -- it's an

          22   every once in a while, yeah.

          23          Q.    Okay.  And once in a while

           4          Q.    When you still have that

           6   me earlier it was a six out of ten right

           7   after the accident.  Is it the same,

           8   better, worse now?

           9          A.    It's better, it's more of an

          10   episode.

          11          Q.    Okay.  And does the hip pain

          12   that you still have, does it happen

          13   regardless of what you're doing, or is

          14   there certain activities or things that

          15   cause the right hip pain still?

          16          A.    It's not based off of an

          17   activity.

          18          Q.    Okay.  And you also

          19   mentioned that you went to physical

          20   therapy, and that was Excel.

           1   can't think of now.

           2          Q.    Is there anything else that

           3   you can think of that was affected?

           4          A.    Not at the very moment.

           5          Q.    Okay.  Is there anything

           6   that you can't do at all now that you

           7   could do before this car accident?

           8          A.    I can't exercise like I used

           9   to, I can't sit in cars for as long as I

          10   used to without stopping, without being

          11   in pain, which is significant to getting

          12   up to see my family.

          13          Q.    Visiting your family less,

          14   is that still going on or has it gotten

          15   any better?

          16          A.    It's still going on.

          17          Q.    So it was four to five times

          18   a year, and now it's two times a year?

          19          A.    Like twice a year, yeah.

          20          Q.    So wearing the splints or

          21   braces at work, does that bother you or

          22   embarrass you or anything like that?

          23          A.    They are annoying, yes, they

          24   do bug me.

           3   those, do they bother you, embarrass you,

           4   or anything like that?

           6          Q.    I'm going to ask that you at

           9   wear during the day and the ones that you

          10   wear during the night.

          11          A.    Okay.

          12          Q.    Provide those to your

          13   attorney and he can send me a copy of

          14   those, if you don't mind.

          15          A.    Okay, sure.

          16          Q.    Let me review my notes, but

          17   I think I'm just about done.

          18          A.    Okay.

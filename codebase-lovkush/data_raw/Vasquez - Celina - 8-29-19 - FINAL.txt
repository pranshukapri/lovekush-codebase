            7       Q.  No?

            8                So, first, I want to hand you what's been

            9  marked as Exhibit 1041 to your deposition and ask if you

           10  can identify that, if you've seen that before.

           11                Have you seen that deposition notice before

           12  today?

           13       A.  I don't remember.

           14       Q.  Okay.  Now I'm going to hand you what's been

           15  marked as Exhibit 1042 to your deposition.  I'll

           16  represent to you those are some supplemental answers to

           17  interrogatories.  Do you recall working with your

           18  lawyers to answer some questions?

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  You don't recall -- if you look at the

            1  you recall them reviewing the answers and then signing

            2  them?  Your signature is not on those because those are

            3  the supplemental ones.  But do you recall that at all?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  As far as you know, are -- is the information

            9  going to hand you a diagram of the plant and a sort of

           10  reddish pen, and then I'm going to have you walk me

           11  through your day last year.  But I'm going to ask you

           12  some questions beforehand.  So -- and I'll have you mark

           13  certain things.

           25  accident happened?

                                                                      18



            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  And where did you park that day?  If you can

            3  look on that map, do you know which gate you came in on?

            4  They're marked 1, 2, 3, 4.

            5       A.  Well, we would park away from the plant -- we

            6  had to come over on a bus.

            7       Q.  Okay.  So you parked in that parking lot that

            8  was at the other Kuraray plant kind of down the road?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  And then you would take a bus to the plant, to

           11  the Kuraray EVAL plant, correct?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  Do you recall which gate the bus came in?  If

           14  you want -- and you can turn it however you need to.

           15       A.  Okay.  I want to say it was to gate -- I want

           16  to say it was to Gate 1.  I don't remember.  I think --

           17  okay.  Wait.  Gate 2.  Because they were --

           18       Q.  You see the plant services building toward --

           19  sort of your -- I guess it's your right hand over here

           20  on the other side where your right hand is.  Do you see

           21  the plant services building?

           22       A.  Yeah.  But I think that parking lot would be

           23  around over here.

           24       Q.  Right.  But I'm not asking you about the

           25  parking lot.  I'm just wondering which gate you came in.

                                                                      19



            1       A.  I want to say we came through here, through

            2  Gate 2, I believe.

            3       Q.  Okay.

            4       A.  Because maintenance building is right there.

            5  There was a gate right here.

            6       Q.  Okay.  Would you circle Gate 2?

            7                All right.  And so was the bus that brought

            8  you in an ISI bus, or was it --

            9       A.  Force.

           10       Q.  Force.

           11                And so there were both Force and ISI

           12  employees on that bus?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  And where did the bus drop you off then?

           15       A.  In the mornings?

           16       Q.  Yes.

           17       A.  About right here.

           18       Q.  Right before the turnstile, like in the parking

           19  lot there?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  Okay.  And did you -- how did you actually

           22  enter the plant area?

           23       A.  Getting off the bus, we walked towards the

           24  turnstile.  We badge in.  We walk -- this is the road.

           25  We walk all the way to a tent that was over here

                                                                      20



            1  somewhere.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So what I want you to do is put a circle

            3  around the turnstile that you entered.  And then I know

            4  you don't know exactly because it's not on that map, but

            5  if you could put a box where you think the tent was or

            6  the general area where the tent was.

            7       A.  It doesn't have to be exact?

            8       Q.  No.  Just -- you've already told me that you

            9  know exactly where it was.  If you can just put the

            8  any thought into it.

            9       Q.  Do -- do you remember what the question was?

           10       A.  I know that somebody had -- did say something

           11  about why -- why doing it now.  And then that question

           12  wasn't asked -- answer -- that question wasn't answered.

           22  all?

           23       A.  No.  That's when the meeting ended, and

            6  remember his name either.

            7       Q.  Okay.  And if you had a question about the work

            8  you were performing on May 19th, who would you have

           13       Q.  What sort of work were you doing for ISI on

           15       A.  Insulation.

           16       Q.  And what does that entail?

           17       A.  That has to do with removing or installing

           18  insulation on pipes.

           19       Q.  And how did you know what kind of work you'd be

           20  doing that day?

                                                                      27

            7       A.  Where the ISI has their scaffold area.

            8       Q.  Okay.  Can you point me to where that would be

            9  on the map?  And maybe put a little box and put "ISI" in

           10  it.

           11       A.  I don't know exactly where it would be right

           12  here, but -- can I just put an approximate --

           13       Q.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Just be sure to put ISI in

           14  there so we know where it was.

           15                And was that location that you're putting

           16  in an approximate place, was that where you went after

           17  the safety meeting?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  And was that like a tent, or was it a building?

           20  Or what was it?

           21       A.  It's like a -- like a tent.

           22       Q.  Tent.  Okay.  And in that meeting, was that the

           23  meeting where Antonio would tell all of the ISI workers

           24  what they were going to do that day?

           25       A.  I -- Antonio would tell the insulation people

                                                                      28



            1  and me.

            2       Q.  Okay.  And -- thank you for clarifying that.

            3                So the insulation people would go that tent

            4  that you've marked with ISI, and Antonio would tell you

            5  what the -- what you were working on that day.

            6       A.  Yes.

            7       Q.  Okay.  And you reported to Antonio, correct?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  And he worked for ISI, correct?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Did you ever speak to anyone at Kuraray about

           12  the work you would be doing on May 19th?

           13       A.  Re-ask that question.

           14       Q.  Sure.

           15                Did you ever speak with anyone at Kuraray

           16  about the work you'd be doing on May 19th?

           17       A.  No.

           18       Q.  Did Kuraray direct any of the work you did

           19  before May 19th of 2018?

           20       A.  Is this also has to do with get getting a

           21  permit?

           22       Q.  Well, that's what I want to know is whether

           23  Kuraray, at any point, directed you --

           24       A.  Oh, yes.  That's a process that we have to go

           25  through.

                                                                      29



            1       Q.  Okay.  And explain that process.

            2       A.  Okay.  After Antonio gives us our assignment,

            3  where we're going to be at, he shows us our work.  And

            4  then we go get the permit with Kuraray operations.

            5       Q.  Right.  So you go over to the operations

            6  building?  Is that what you did?

            7       A.  Yes.  To get the permit.

            8       Q.  And you get a permit, which just tells you --

            9  allows you to be in the area where you're going to work,

           10  correct?

           11       A.  Correct.  Yes.

           12       Q.  But it doesn't tell you the type of work you're

           13  doing, correct?

           14       A.  Yes, it does tell --

           15       Q.  It tells you insulation, correct?

           16       A.  It says install- -- installing insulation on,

           17  let's say, 1100.

           18       Q.  Okay.

           19       A.  And then it will tell you the number of the

           20  equipment.

           21       Q.  Okay.  But it doesn't tell you how to do it?

           22       A.  Oh, no.

           23       Q.  It just tells you -- that permit just gives you

           24  the right to be in that location doing your job.

           25       A.  Right.

                                                                      30



            1       Q.  And if you had a question about the details of

            2  your job at any time, you would ask Antonio, correct?

            3       A.  Or ask -- or Kuraray personnel tells us, you

            4  know what, we're -- were working on this line across

            5  where you're at.  We're going to be doing this.  So you

            6  know there's some type of a hazard.

            7       Q.  Right.  So what I'm asking is, is the actual

            8  work of doing insulation.  You wouldn't ever have a --

            9  or you wouldn't have any reason to ask anyone at Kuraray

           10  about how you would do that work, correct?

           11       A.  Right.  No.

           12       Q.  They just directed you where you were to do

           13  that work and told you if anybody else was working in

           14  the area so you could be careful?

           15       A.  Correct.

           16       Q.  So ISI was the one that really controlled the

           17  details of your work that you did on May 19th, correct?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  And were you working a crew that day on

           20  May 19th?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Excuse me.  How many people were in your crew?

           23       A.  I don't remember the -- the number, but...

           24       Q.  Was it more than two?

           25       A.  Yes.

                                                                      31



            1       Q.  Was it more than five?

            2       A.  I don't remember more than five.

            3       Q.  Was it more than ten?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  No?

            6                So it was somewhere between three and ten?

            7                Let me ask you this:  Do you remember any

            8  of the names of any of the people that were in your

            9  crew?

           10       A.  I do remember.

           11       Q.  Okay.  What are their names?

           12       A.  Oscar --

           13       Q.  What?

           14       A.  Oscar.

           15       Q.  Oscar.

           16       A.  Santiago.  You said my crew.  I know that we

           17  had -- we also have scaffold people.

           18       Q.  Right.  But I mean the people that you were

           19  actually --

           20       A.  Right.

           21       Q.  -- doing the insulation with.

           22       A.  Okay.  Oscar, Santiago.  About -- I want to say

           23  about five people.

           24       Q.  Do you know the names of any of the others

           25  aside from Oscar and Santiago?

                                                                      32



            1       A.  No.

            2       Q.  Had you worked with those same people on other

            3  occasions?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  And how long had this project been going on?

            6       A.  Do you want exact timing?

            7       Q.  Just in general.

            8       A.  About a year.

            9       Q.  About a year?

           10                But you had been working there about nine

           11  months?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  And when you started the project, when you were

           14  assigned to the Kuraray plant by ISI, did you know you

           15  were working on a turnaround?

           16       A.  Yes.

           17       Q.  And isn't it true that your employer, ISI, told

           18  you that there would be a startup during your

           19  employment?

           20       A.  Yes.

           21       Q.  What was your usual work schedule?  How many

           22  hours and how many days?

           23       A.  It was 10 hours.

           24       Q.  10 hours a day.

           25       A.  Prior to startup.

                                                                      33



            1       Q.  Prior to startup?

            2       A.  Uh-huh.

            3       Q.  Is that a "yes"?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  And then how many days did you have to work

            6  before having a day off?

            7       A.  It was 13 days.

            8       Q.  13 days.

            9                And then you got one day off?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  And when you say "prior to startup," what was

           12  the date of startup?

           13       A.  Well, that always changed.

           14       Q.  Okay.  So on May 19th of 2018, was that prior

           15  to startup or after startup?

           16       A.  That was already startup.

           17       Q.  It was after startup?

           18       A.  Uh-huh.

           19       Q.  Or --

           20       A.  It was still the turnaround.

           21       Q.  It was to the turnaround.  So the startup was

           22  starting, for lack of a better word?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And so that was your understanding on May 18th

           25  [sic] is that they were going to start the plant back up

                                                                      34



            1  again?

            2       A.  Yes.  They were waiting on our -- on us to

            3  finish doing some of the insulation.

            4       Q.  So it -- so they weren't going to start it up

            5  on May 18th, but they were going to wait until you

            6  finished the insulation?

            7       A.  Uh-huh.

            8       Q.  Is that a "yes"?

            9       A.  Yes.

           10       Q.  Okay.  So what I want you to do is take that

           11  map.  And first -- well, you parked offsite; so don't

           12  worry about that.

           13                I want to know where you were working the

           14  morning of the incident right before the incident, and I

           15  want you to put a W where that was.

           16       A.  Does it have to be exactly where?

           17       Q.  Just in the general location of where you were.

           18                And what unit is that?

           19       A.  1100.

           20       Q.  And is that the same location you were when the

           21  incident occurred?  Where you put that W?

           22       A.  Yes.

           23       Q.  Yes?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  Okay.  And what was your first indication that

                                                                      35



            1  something had happened?

            2       A.  Okay.  Ask me that question again.

            3       Q.  What's your first indication that something had

            4  happened?

            5       A.  There -- there was a noise, and it was rambling

            6  on the ground.

            7       Q.  Rumbling on the ground?

            8       A.  Uh-huh.

            9       Q.  Is that a "yes"?

           10       A.  Yes.  Sorry.

           11       Q.  That's okay.

           12                And so what kind of noise was it?

           13       A.  Like a -- like -- like pipes --

           14       Q.  Hitting each other or --

           15       A.  Yeah.  It was like a rumbling.  It was just --

           16  turbulence kind of thing.

           17       Q.  And when you were at that location that you've

           18  marked with a W, were you on the ground?  Were you on --

           19       A.  I was getting off the ladder.

           20       Q.  And what was the ladder going to?

           21       A.  It was a scaffold to the tank where we were

           22  going to be working on.

           23       Q.  Okay.  So you were getting off the ladder to go

           24  to the ground?

           25       A.  Yes.  I was already like on the second prong, I

                                                                      36



            1  think, or rung --

            2       Q.  From the -- second rung from the bottom?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  And you were going down, correct?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  And that's when you felt the rumbling and heard

            7  the pipes?

            8       A.  Correct.

            9       Q.  So were you tied off on anything?  I mean, did

           10  you have to be connected by any sort of --

           11       A.  No.  Because I didn't -- I was not way up

           12  there.  I was just -- when -- when it has to be like

           13  4 feet or 6 feet under.

           14       Q.  So you hadn't been above 4 or 6 feet?

           15       A.  Right.  Exactly.

           16       Q.  Do you have a good recollection of where you

           17  were that day?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  Was there anyone around you at the time the

           20  incident happened?

           21       A.  Yes.  A lot of contractors.

           22       Q.  Do you know the names of any of the people?

           23       A.  I know -- I know Giovanny was there.  I know

           24  Santos was there.  Oscar, Luis was there.

           25                THE REPORTER:  Did you say "Oscar Luis"?

                                                                      37

            1       A.  Yes.

            2       Q.  And being an insulator, correct?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  And that would have been in the whole nine

            5  months you were there?

            7       Q.  Was there -- was there anything in your hands

           20  my tool pouch.

           21       Q.  Anything else?

           22       A.  No.  That -- my FR clothes.  Ear plugs.

           23       Q.  And you were wearing the FRC, correct?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  Did you know what your designated muster point

                                                                      39



            1  was when you were working at that location you've marked

            2  with a W?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4       Q.  Can you put an M where your designated muster

            5  point was?

            6       A.  Again, more or less, right?

            7       Q.  Yes.

            8                Okay.  And could you -- after you heard

            9  this rumbling noise and the pipes, could you see where

           10  fire was coming from?

           11       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  Can you put an F where the fire was coming

           13  from?

           14                And was there any smoke in the area where

           15  you were?

           16       A.  I don't remember.

           17       Q.  And did you have a radio?

           19       Q.  Did you hear anyone else with a radio?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  And so I assume you did not use a radio to call

           22  anybody?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  So after you heard the noise and you came -- I

           25  assume you came down the ladder, correct, the last two

                                                                      40



            1  rungs?

            2       A.  Uh-huh.

            3       Q.  Is that a "yes"?

            4       A.  Yes.

            5       Q.  Okay.  That's all right.

            6                What did you do next?

            7       A.  I came down because Antonio had told me to get

            8  off to get a permit for somebody else.

            9       Q.  Okay.  So you were coming down the ladder

           10  because someone else needed a permit?

           11       A.  Yes.  The thing is, I was going to tell them

           12  that I was going to leave to -- we're supposed to tell

           13  everybody when we're not going to be in the group.

           14  Like -- it's like a brother-sister keeper.  If I'm with

           15  you in a group, I have to say, you know what, I'm -- I'm

           16  going to get moved somewhere else.

           17       Q.  Okay.

           18       A.  That way everybody knows, okay, well, you know

           19  what, we don't have to look for her in case of an

           20  emergency.

           21       Q.  Sure.

           22       A.  So it's communicating.

           23       Q.  So had you told anybody that yet?

           24       A.  Yes.  I had told -- I had told Giovanny.

           25       Q.  Okay.  And so then what I want to know is when

                                                                      41



            1  you got down off the ladder, what did you do next when

            2  you heard the noise?

            3       A.  I -- I -- I stood there.  And then one of the

            4  other guys from Force, he told me -- he was standing

            5  still, and he's like, "It doesn't sound right.  Let's

            6  run."

            7                I told my coworkers to get off and run.

            8  And we ran.

            9       Q.  And you mean the coworkers you just identified?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  Okay.  So what I want you to do now is take the

           12  pen and draw an arrow in the direction you ran and then

           13  an E where you ended up.

           14       A.  You're going to have to repeat yourself.  I'm

           15  sorry.

           16       Q.  Sure.

           17                I want you to draw an arrow from where you

           18  were you -- you had a W where you were working.

           19       A.  Uh-huh.

           20       Q.  And you told me you came down off the ladder,

           21  and you were two rungs from the bottom when you heard

           22  the noise.  And then somebody told you it didn't sound

           23  right.  I want you to draw an arrow till you get to a

           24  point where you ended -- where you -- where your end

           25  was.

                                                                      42



            1       A.  I'm going to put here "parking" because there

            2  was another parking over here.

            3       Q.  And that's across from the plant services

            4  building?  Sort of?

            5       A.  Somewhat.  Yes.  I guess.  Because we ran this

            6  way.

            7       Q.  Just keep putting an arrow where you ran.

            8       A.  I don't remember how I got to here, but we

            9  ended up over here.

           10       Q.  Put an E where you ended up.

           11                Okay.  And when you -- you said you were

           12  told to run, or you just ran?

           13       A.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Where I was at, there's a

           14  little gravel -- there's rocks in the area.  There's

           15  like a little ditch type.

           16       Q.  Uh-huh.

           17       A.  So I went through there.  I fell down, and then

           18  I got up.  And the other guy that was going to -- was

           19  telling me to run got me, and we ran.

           20       Q.  Okay.  And who was it that told you to run?

           21       A.  A guy from Force.  He was a foreman.

           22       Q.  Okay.  You don't know what his name was?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  And when you say he got you and told you to

           25  run, did -- was there something -- did you fall --

                                                                      43



            1       A.  I fell down.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So how close to the ladder that you had

            3  just come down off of did you fall?

            5       Q.  Okay.

            6       A.  And then I slid with the rocks, and I fell

            7  down.

           14       Q.  Okay.  And so was it this Force gentleman whose

           15  name you don't know that helped pick you up?

           16       A.  Yes.

           12       Q.  And what did they do for you in that second

           13  visit?

           14       A.  On that one, they -- they checked my vitals, my

            7       Q.  Left knee was what was hurting.  Did you ever

           16       Q.  Did any doctor ever tell you that the diarrhea

           17  was caused by the accident at Kuraray?

           18       A.  Dr. Bashir mentioned that it -- it had to do

           20       Q.  Have you seen any other doctors, other than the

            1       Q.  What was that?

            2       A.  He -- the doctor told me that -- that due to a

            3  quick movement or twist or turn could have caused the

            4  spine to have moved, and my back slipped -- my curvature

            5  was off.  And it was pinching my nerves.  That's why

            6  whenever I needed to go bathroom in bed, I couldn't.

            7  Whenever I had to go to the bathroom, I couldn't even

            8  feel any of it.  So I was -- I was getting incontinent.

            9       Q.  And so that was corrected in the surgery?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  So you seem to be relieved --

           12       A.  Very relieved.

           13       Q.  Okay.  All right.  So as we sit here today, do

           14  you feel pain in any area of your body?

           15       A.  No.  Just my surgical cut.  I'm still supposed

           16  to be resting.

           17       Q.  Right.  So just your -- you have an anterior

           18  and a posterior cut?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20       Q.  So you have it in your stomach and in your

           21  back?

           22       A.  Yes, ma'am.

           23       Q.  And so that's the only thing that you feel pain

           24  now?

           25       A.  Yes.

                                                                      70



            1       Q.  You don't have any pain in your knees any

            2  longer?

            3       A.  No.  That went away, too.  I had surgery.

            4       Q.  Okay.  What surgery did you have on yours

            5  knees?

            6       A.  On the left one, they called it -- I don't

            7  remember, but it was because there was some -- it was

            8  pinching.  My cartilage was out of my knee.

            9       Q.  Was it a meniscal tear?

           10       A.  Oh, Yes.

           11       Q.  Okay.

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  And they went in with an arthroscopic surgery?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  And they -- they cut it out?

           16       A.  Yes.

            3       Q.  And so has the surgery on your knee and your

            4  let the kids come?

            5       A.  Yes.  And then she was okay.  But our personal

            6  life wasn't happy, because we -- we couldn't be

            7  together.  Intimacy.

            8       Q.  Any other relationships been affected by your

           10       Q.  So that you were looking forward to doing that?

           13       Q.  Okay.

           14       A.  And I was just writing how -- what if I don't,

           15  just letting out.

           16       Q.  That you were worried about that?

           17       A.  Yes.

           18       Q.  Okay.  So most of this -- what you write down

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  It's not as much related to the mental -- I

           21       Q.  When did you first start working as an

           22  insulator?

           23       A.  Back then -- when I was working with Brand.

            1       Q.  So how did you decide to get into being an

            2  insulator?

            3       A.  I liked it.  It was something different.

            4       Q.  And you made more money doing that than what

            5  you'd been doing before, right?

            6       A.  Correct.  And it's actually considered a craft.

            7       Q.  It's -- you like crafts?

            8       A.  Yes.

            9       Q.  Okay.  Do you do any other kind of crafts at

           15       Q.  And before that, what kind of things did you

            9                And Brand Energy Solutions, is that -- you

           11       A.  Yes, ma'am.

           12       Q.  Okay.  All right.  And then if we go back as

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  Okay.  And obviously getting into the

           18       A.  Correct.

           19       Q.  And in the last ten years, it looks like you

           17       Q.  Okay.  Let's see.  So is it fair to say that

            1  They just said that -- that -- you can't work here no

            3       Q.  And was there something that happened that --

            4       A.  Well, it was just after the explosion, but that

           12       Q.  Okay.  What has been your -- we talked about

           14  you know?

           15       A.  Well, it varied because -- you know how when

           16  the shutdown -- or turnaround starts, it goes to 13 to

           18       Q.  Yeah.

           19       A.  So then it's 12 hours a day.  And when it's not

           20  a turnaround mode, we go back to 10 days.

           21       Q.  Right.  So --

           22       A.  I wouldn't know how to answer that question.

           23       Q.  So would you agree with me in 2018 you made the

           10       A.  No.

           11       Q.  And you've not filed a workers' comp claim --

           12       A.  No.

           13       Q.  -- because of this?

           14                Is there a reason why you have not?

           15       A.  They didn't -- they didn't say that we could.

           16  I remember when we were going back to work like on

           17  Monday and Tuesday, even Sammy, our supervisor, had said

           18  like, "If you're not here on Monday, you're all going to

           19  get fired."  Or "If you don't sign this paper, you're

           20  all going to get fired."

           21       Q.  What paper was that?

           22       A.  Just a paper saying that -- what did he say?  I

           23  don't remember exactly what it said, but a lot of us

           24  didn't want to sign it.

           25       Q.  You didn't sign it?

            1       A.  A lot of us didn't want to sign it, but I still

            2  signed it.

            3       Q.  Okay.  And you don't know what it said?

            4       A.  No.  Because it didn't have anything.  He just

            5  wanted to put everybody's name on it and said that if we

            6  don't sign it, we're going to get -- oh, I remember now.

            7  He said something about if you don't -- if you don't

            8  sign -- I can't remember exactly.

            9       Q.  Okay.  And who was that that said that?

           10       A.  Sammy, our superintendent.

           11       Q.  And so you never reported your injury to ISI?

           12       A.  Right.

           13       Q.  And what was the reason for not reporting your

           14  injury?

           15       A.  Because in -- I was afraid I wasn't going to

           16  have a job anymore.

           17       Q.  But even after they terminated you, you didn't

           18  think you could --

           19       A.  No.

           20       Q.  -- make a claim?

           21       A.  No.  They didn't tell us about any of that.

           22       Q.  Did your injuries hire -- cause you to have to

                                                                     111



            1       A.  No.

            2       Q.  Based on your five years' experience working in

            3  the chemical industry, will you agree there's certain

            4  risks associated with working in the chemical industry?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  And what are those risks?

            7       A.  Ex -- explosion, contamination.

            8       Q.  And you knew about those risks when you went to

            9  work at the Kuraray EVAL plant?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  And you were trained in how to respond to those

           12  risks?

           13       A.  Yes.

           14       Q.  Safety is important in your business, right?

           15       A.  Yes.

           16       Q.  And that's because you work in a business that

           17  has more risks than a lot of other peoples' business,

           18  right?

           19       A.  Yes.

           20                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

           21       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  And you face those risks

           22  every day if you work in those chemical plants?

           23       A.  Yes.

           24       Q.  And that's one of the reasons you receive

           25  frequent, extensive safety training is so that you have

                                                                     112



            1  the knowledge of how to take the necessary precautions

            2  when you're working, right?

            3       A.  Yes.

            4                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

            5       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  And you're the best person

            6  to look after your own safety, right?

            7                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

            8                THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            9       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  And looking back on

           10  May 19th, is there anything you think you could have

           11  done more safely so that you wouldn't have gotten

           12  injured?

           13                MR. KETKAR:  Objection; form.

           14                THE WITNESS:  No.

           15       Q.  (BY MS. LUNCEFORD)  Okay.  Before 5/19, did you

           16  have any -- of last year, did you have any plans to

           17  become a supervisor?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  And would that just be a supervisor of

           20  insulators?

           21       A.  Yes.

           22       Q.  Do you have plans to possibly become a

           23  supervisor now?

           24       A.  Yes.

           25       Q.  Anything you have to do to become a supervisor?

                                                                     113



            1  Just more work experience, or is there any education?

            2       A.  No.  I'm -- I'm already at that.

            3       Q.  You already had enough experience that you

            4  could apply for a supervisor?

            5       A.  Yes.

            6       Q.  Okay.  And I suppose being a supervisor is not

            7  as physically demanding as being an insulator?

            8       A.  No.

            9       Q.  It's not as physically demanding?

           10       A.  No.  What do you mean?  I'm sorry.

           11       Q.  I think we're just miscommunicating.

           12                So if you're a supervisor, you don't have

           13  to do as much physical work as you are as an insulator,

           14  correct?  When you're supervising the people that are

           15  doing the work, correct?

           16       A.  Right.

           17       Q.  So you're not doing as much physical work like

           18  climbing and that sort of thing?

           19       A.  I mean, well, you still have to go and see the

           20  job, but you're just not working hands-on.

           21       Q.  Right.  But an insulator, it isn't -- it isn't

           22  that -- like you're not having to carry heavy things as

           23  much, correct?

           24       A.  Right.  We don't carry the heavy stuff.  We

           25  tell the -- the general contractor to move it with the

                                                                     114



            1  forklift.

            2       Q.  Okay.  So -- so being an insulator is not a

            3  real physically demanding job?

            4       A.  It is a demanding job.

            5       Q.  I know it's a demanding job.  But I mean

            6  physical like --

            7       A.  No.

            8       Q.  You don't carry big things.  You don't have to

            9  use your back as much and that sort of stuff?

           10       A.  Well, it is demanding because you have to

           11  squat.

           12       Q.  Okay.  And so as a supervisor, would you have

           13  to squat?

           14       A.  Yes.

           15       Q.  But you'd have to squat just to look to see if

           16  somebody did the job right, correct?

           17       A.  Correct.

           18       Q.  Had you ever been hurt on the job before

           19  May 19th?

           20       A.  No.

           21       Q.  Had you ever applied for Social Security

           22  disability?

           23       A.  No.

           24       Q.  Have you ever been -- have you ever filed for

           25  unemployment?

                                                                     115



            1       A.  I tried after they told me it was a layoff, but

            2  it wasn't a layoff.  It was like a termination.

            3       Q.  Okay.  And you didn't appeal that decision?

            4       A.  No.

            5       Q.  And any other time you ever applied for

            6  unemployment?

            7       A.  Yes.  It was after the Turner job when I got an

            8  actual layoff.

            9       Q.  And that was the one just in December?

           10       A.  Yes.

           11       Q.  And did you get unemployment?

           12       A.  Yes.

           13       Q.  For how many weeks?

           14       A.  For I think through -- if I recall correctly,

           15  through April.

           16       Q.  Okay.  So you had unemployment from December

           17  through April?

           18       A.  Yes.

           19       Q.  And was that because you didn't work for Turner

           20  very long; that was all you were entitled to?

           21       A.  Right.

           22       Q.  Okay.  Have you ever filed any other lawsuits

           23  aside from this one?

           24       A.  No, ma'am.

           25       Q.  Has anyone ever sued you?

                                                                     116



            1       A.  No, ma'am.

            2       Q.  Have you ever been convicted of a felony?

            3       A.  No, ma'am.

            4       Q.  Have you ever been arrested in Texas or any

            5  other state?

            6       A.  No, ma'am.

            7                MS. LUNCEFORD:  Okay.  I think that's all

            8  the questions I have.  Thank you.

            9                THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           10                MR. KETKAR:  We'll reserve our questions

           11  for trial.

         6                  DIRECT EXAMINATION

         7

         8 BY MS. HELLER:

         9      Q     Good morning.  This is your continued

        10 deposition.  The original one was taken -- or the

        11 beginning was on March 12, 2019.  At that time, we

        12 went over all of the rules for depositions.  I'm

        13 just going to go over a couple of important things

        14 again so that you remember.

        15            First of all, it's important that you

        16 understand any question I ask.  So if you don't

        17 understand, you should say that so I could rephrase

        18 it.

        19            Do you understand?

        20      A     Yes.

        21      Q     And whenever I'm talking, wait for me to

        22 finish so that we can make a clear record.  Also,

        23 your answers should be full words rather than

        24 gestures or sounds.
                                                             58



         1            Do you understand those rules?

         2      A     Yes, ma'am.

         3      Q     Thank you.

         4            And just to reconfirm, are you still

         5 employed by Travelers?

         6      A     Yes.

         7      Q     Same position?

         8      A     Yes.

         9      Q     Okay.  So what is your e-mail address?

        10      A     My personal e-mail address?

        11      Q     Yeah.

        12            What is your personal e-mail address?

        13      A     MargaretV152@gmail.com.

        14      Q     What is your work e-mail address?

        15      A     Why?

        16            It doesn't have to do anything with the

        17 case.

        18      Q     What is your work e-mail address?

        19      A     That's Travelers' e-mail address.  I

        20 can't -- I'm not going to give you that.

        21      Q     Okay.

        22                (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No.

        23                16, E-mails, was marked for

        24                identification.)

         1 BY MS. HELLER:

         2      Q     I'm going to offer what's been marked as

         3 Plaintiff's Exhibit 16.

         4                 MS. HELLER:  We premarked them --

         5                 MR. KELLY:  Okay.

         6                 MS. HELLER:  -- but I have copies --

         7                 MR. KELLY:  Yeah.

         8                 MS. HELLER:  -- of everything --

         9                 MR. KELLY:  That's fine.

        10                 MS. HELLER:  -- for you.

        11 BY MS. HELLER:

        12      Q     I'll give that to you --

        13                 MR. KELLY:  Thank you.

        14 BY MS. HELLER:

        15      Q     -- for you to take a look at.  These are

        16 e-mails that you provided to us.

        17            Do you recognize them?

        18      A     That's because I send it to myself from

        19 my phone because I couldn't print it out.

        20      Q     What's because you sent it to yourself

        21 from your phone?

        22      A     This e-mail, I -- I send it to -- from my

        23 phone to Travelers because -- so I could print it

        24 out.
                                                             60



         1      Q     So you did not directly e-mail Mr. Stuart

         2 from your Travelers' e-mail address?

         3      A     I -- I don't recall doing that, no.

         4      Q     Okay.

         5                (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No.

         6                7, Charles Stuart's Application,

         7                previously marked for identification

         8                was introduced for reference.)

         9 BY MS. HELLER:

        10      Q     Okay.  I'm going to direct us to one of

        11 our prior exhibits.  This was previously marked as

        12 Plaintiff's Exhibit 7.  This is the full exhibit

        13 here.  If you want to take a look at that.  That is

        14 the application for Charles Stuart.

        15            Can you tell me what e-mail address is

        16 written at the top?

        17      A     I guess my work e-mail.

        18      Q     So is it possible that you communicated

        19 with Mr. Stuart from your work e-mail address?

        20      A     I just told you I don't recall doing that

        21 but maybe.

        22      Q     Okay.

        23                (Whereupon, there was a discussion

        24                off the record.)
                                                             61



         1 BY MS. HELLER:

         2      Q     Okay.  So what is your work e-mail

         3 address?

         4      A     It's on the --

         5      Q     Can you please state it for the record?

         6      A     Margaret V -- m-v-a-l-e-n-t-2,

         7 @travelers.com.

         8      Q     Okay.  Thank you.

         9            And did you use both e-mail addresses to

        10 conduct rental-related businesses?

        11      A     I just told you no.

        12      Q     No what?

        13      A     I did not do that.

        14      Q     Okay.  So -- and the e-mail addresses

        15 that you gave us today were also your e-mail

        16 addresses in 2016; is that correct?

        17      A     MargaretV152@gmail.com is my e-mail --

        18 personal e-mail address, yes.

        19      Q     Now and in 2016?

        20      A     Yup.

        21      Q     Okay.  So in preparation for today's

        22 deposition, did you review your e-mails in your

        23 Gmail account to determine whether you had any

        24 responsive e-mails for us?
                                                             62



         1      A     I did that prior, long time ago when you

         2 asked me the first time.

         3      Q     When --

         4      A     March.

         5      Q     -- did you do that?

         6      A     Sometime in March.

         7      Q     And so you --

         8      A     There's nothing in there.

         9      Q     So you searched your Gmail account?

        10      A     Yes, ma'am.

        11      Q     What terms did you use?

        12      A     I logged in my account and checked it.  I

        13 don't understand your question.

        14      Q     You don't understand the question?

        15      A     No.

        16      Q     Are you aware of the search function in

        17 Gmail?

        18      A     I just logged in and checked my e-mails

        19 and I have no e-mails pertaining to this.  That was

        20 your question.  No, ma'am.

        21      Q     How did you determine that?

        22                 THE WITNESS:  I don't think she

        23            understands my response.

        24                 MR. KELLY:  Just --
                                                             63



         1 BY MS. HELLER:

         2      Q     Would you like to go off the record to

         3 consult with your attorney?

         4      A     No.  I don't.  Anything in my Gmail

         5 account has nothing to do with you or anything in

         6 this case.

         7      Q     How do you know that?

         8      A     I just know.  It's been years.

         9      Q     Did you perform a search in your Gmail

        10 account for any terms related to this case?

        11      A     I just told you I did and there was

        12 nothing, ma'am.

        13      Q     What terms did you use?

        14      A     I searched for dates.  Nothing.

        15      Q     So you just searched for dates?

        16      A     Anything -- there's nothing there.

        17 Anything -- anything that's there is previous of --

        18      Q     Okay.

        19      A     Prior.

        20                (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No.

        21                11, Letter Dated April 9 from Ms.

         2      Q     I'm going to offer what's been marked as

         3 Plaintiff's Exhibit 11.  If you can, please take a

         4 look at this.

         5                 MS. HELLER:  I'm going to take back

         6            16 and I'll give you a copy,

         7            Attorney Kelly.

         8                 MR. KELLY:  Uh-huh.

         9                 MS. HELLER:  And this is the April 9

        10            letter from myself to Attorney Kelly.

        11 BY MS. HELLER:

        12      Q     Have you ever seen this before?

        13      A     You send so many of them.

        14            Yes, I saw all of them.

        15      Q     Okay.  Do you remember seeing this one?

        16      A     Perhaps, yeah.

        17      Q     Okay.  So in this e-mail -- I mean, in

        18 this letter, I ask that you search for a list of

        19 terms.

        20            Did you complete those searches?

        21      A     Ma'am -- ma'am, let me just tell you

        22 something.  You answer -- you asked that question

        23 and I already answered it.

        24      Q     Please answer it again.
                                                             65



         1      A     There's -- there's nothing there.

         2      Q     That's not my question.

         3      A     That's my answer.

         4      Q     My question is did you search for each of

         5 these terms?

         6      A     Yes, and there's nothing there.

         7      Q     When did you do those?

         8      A     When I was told to in March.

         9      Q     This letter is dated April 9.

        10      A     Anything -- I wasn't going to have it

        11 before, I wasn't going to have it today or tomorrow.

        12 I don't have it.

        13            I mean, what do you want me to do?

        14      Q     I want you to do the searches and print

        15 out the results as I requested in this letter.

        16            Have you done that?

        17      A     I gave you all the copies what was in my

        18 Gmail I provided copies already, ma'am.

        19      Q     No e-mails were provided after I sent

        20 this letter.

        21      A     Because there wasn't any.

        22      Q     But your testimony is you searched for

        23 each of these terms that is in this letter?

        24      A     I just told you there's nothing there.
                                                             66



         1      Q     That's not my question.

         2            You searched for each of these terms --

         3      A     Yes.

         4      Q     -- correct?

         5      A     And there's nothing there.

         6      Q     After April 9?

         7      A     Yes.

         8      Q     Did you print out the results of search?

         9      A     No, there's nothing there.

        10      Q     Why didn't you print out the results of

        11 the search?

        12      A     Because there's nothing to print out.

        13      Q     That would show me, if you printed out,

        14 nothing.  That's what we were looking for in this

        15 letter.

        16      A     I didn't do that, ma'am.

        17                 MS. HELLER:  So we are going to have

        18            to continue this again so we can get

        19            those documents.

        20      A     There's nothing there, ma'am.

        21 BY MS. HELLER:

        22      Q     Right.  And that's what we need to see or

        23 else we need to get Google to send us your access --

        24      A     Then do that.
                                                             67



         1      Q     -- to your account.

         2            Okay.  Well, if you are willing to sign

         3 an authorization for us to seek the e-mails directly

         4 from Gmail, we can do that.

         5            Is that what you prefer?

         6      A     Do whatever you wanted to do.

         7      Q     Will you sign an authorization?

         8      A     I don't know.

         9      Q     Okay.  Well, we can't get them without an

        10 authorization from you, from Google so, unless we

        11 can get a court order -- so, I mean --

        12      A     So get a court order.

        13      Q     Okay.  All right.  Did you look for your

        14 old cell phone prior to today's deposition?

        15      A     Yes.

        16      Q     Did you find it?

        17      A     Yes.

        18      Q     And did you find any text messages on it?

        19      A     Not from 2016, no.

        20      Q     Okay.  So you looked for text messages

        21 specifically related to this case?

        22      A     Yes, ma'am.

        23      Q     When did you do that?

        24      A     The last time we got a meeting here, in
                                                             68



         1 March, some time in March.

         2      Q     Prior to the March deposition or after

         3 the March deposition?

         4      A     After.

         5      Q     Okay.  Okay.  So if there were no text

         6 messages from 2016 on the old phone that you

         7 previously testified is what you used in 2016, why

         8 weren't they there?

         9      A     I don't keep my text messages, ma'am.

        10      Q     So you make it a policy to delete text

        11 messages?

        12      A     Most of the time, yes.

        13      Q     Okay.

        14      A     I shouldn't.

        15      Q     When did you --

        16      A     But I'm -- I don't do that any more

        17 but --

        18      Q     When did you delete the messages from

        19 2016?

        20      A     I don't remember that.  That was three

        21 years ago.  I don't know.  I don't know.

        22      Q     Okay.  You previously testified at CHRO

        23 that when Maria Cuerda and myself called your work

        24 number, it was on a recorded line.
                                                             69



         1            What does that mean?

         2      A     You guys are lying, that's what that

         3 means.  You guys fabricated that whole story, at

         4 least Maria did, that I told her this, this.  I

         5 don't know what she --

         6      Q     Okay.

         7      A     -- was talking about.

         8      Q     Okay.

         9                 MS. HELLER:  That is not --

        10                 MR. POOLE:  Object as nonresponsive.

        11                 MS. HELLER:  Yeah, nonresponsive.

        12 BY MS. HELLER:

        13      Q     That is not my question.

        14            What does it mean --

        15      A     I'm just saying --

        16      Q     -- that the calls were on a recorded

        17 line?

        18      A     I called her from my phone because she

        19 was threatening me.

        20      Q     That is not my question.

        21                 MR. POOLE:  Move to strike.

        22 BY MS. HELLER:

        23      Q     What does it mean that the calls were on

        24 a recorded line?
                                                             70



         1      A     You are being recorded.

         2      Q     So are there recordings of those calls?

         3      A     I don't know.  You can -- you can ask

         4 Travelers.

         5      Q     Okay.  So you've made no efforts to

         6 obtain those recordings?

         7      A     Why would I want to ask my employer of

         8 recordings of a civil case when I could get

         9 terminated for that?

        10            I'm not going to ask them for that.  If

        11 you need them, you do it.

        12      Q     Well, in fact, the reason is we asked for

        13 them in the deposition notice, you were bound to

        14 look for them.  You were bound to look for them and

        15 bring them if they exist.

        16      A     I don't know if they exist and I'm not

        17 going to ask them if they exist.

        18      Q     So you would prefer that we serve

        19 Travelers with a subpoena?

        20      A     I don't know.

        21      Q     Okay.  We are going to turn to discuss

        22 the property at 60 Jerry Road.  For the record, will

        23 you agree that if we refer to "the property," we're

        24 referring to the property known as 5860 Jerry Road
                                                             71



         1 in East Hartford?

         2      A     I guess.

         3      Q     Yes or no?

         4      A     Yes, I guess.  Yeah.

         5      Q     So if I say "the property," I'm

         6 referencing 60 Jerry Road.

         7            So you rented the property to pay for the

         8 mortgage?

         9      A     Absolutely.

        10      Q     Were you also receiving any profit after

        11 you paid the mortgage?

        12      A     No.  Never.

        13      Q     How much was the mortgage payment?

        14      A     I don't remember.  It was a lot.

        15      Q     Okay.  When you rented the unit, you

        16 wanted to make sure that your tenants could pay the

        17 rent; correct?

        18      A     Yes.

        19      Q     And I also understand you had certain

        20 criterias; correct?

        21      A     Yes.

        22      Q     You asked prospective tenants about their

        23 income?

        24      A     Yes.
                                                             72



         1      Q     And their reason for moving?

         2      A     Yes.

         3      Q     And their credit score?

         4      A     Yes.

         5      Q     Anything else?

         6      A     How many people were living in the

         7 apartment.

         8      Q     Did you have a limit on the number of

         9 people --

        10      A     No.

        11      Q     -- that you would rent it to?

        12      A     No, ma'am.

        13      Q     Is there a certain credit score that you

        14 associate with the term "fair"?

        15      A     Yes.

        16      Q     What?

        17      A     To me fair, is very poor.

        18      Q     Is there a certain number that you

        19 associate with that?

        20      A     I would say between 400 to 450.

        21      Q     Did you ever ask Ms. Cortes for her exact

        22 credit score?

        23      A     I didn't have to ask.  She volunteered

        24 it.
                                                             73



         1      Q     What was her credit score?

         2      A     She said it was poor.

         3      Q     Okay.  So if she said it was fair, would

         4 that have been better than poor?

         5      A     I don't know.

         6      Q     Okay.

         7      A     I don't know.

         8      Q     Okay.  Would you have rented to someone

         9 whose credit was described as fair without knowing

        10 the exact term?

        11      A     I can't answer that, because I don't know

        12 what I would have done at that point in time.

        13      Q     Do you know the amount of money a person

        14 must make to no longer be eligible for Section 8?

        15      A     Absolutely not.

        16      Q     Do you know if a person's credit score

        17 has anything to do with whether they receive

        18 Section 8?

        19      A     I don't believe it does, but I don't

        20 know.  I don't work for Section 8.  I don't know

        21 what they are.

        22      Q     Have you ever contacted anyone who does

        23 work for Section 8?

        24      A     Yes, I have.
                                                             74



         1      Q     Who did you contact?

         2      A     The inspector.

         3      Q     Which inspector?

         4      A     His name was Tom, East Hartford.

         5      Q     When did you contact Tom?

         6      A     When I was trying to do something in my

         7 apartment.  I don't remember exactly what it was,

         8 but I did speak to him.

         9      Q     When was that?

        10      A     I don't remember the date or time.

        11      Q     Was it prior to August 2016 when you

        12 listed the apartment for rent?

        13      A     I think it was after that.

        14      Q     So it was after you listed the apartment

        15 for rent that you contacted Tom from East Hartford?

        16      A     I'm not going to say the dates, because

        17 I'm not sure.  I don't know if it was August, June,

        18 I don't know.

        19      Q     What did Tom tell you?

        20      A     I don't remember that either.

        21      Q     Did Tom put anything in writing?

        22      A     No.

        23      Q     Who did to work for?

        24      A     Section 8.
                                                             75



         1      Q     Okay.  Well, Section 8 --

         2      A     East Hartford.

         3      Q     -- refers to a statutory section.

         4            Is it the East Hartford Housing

         5 Authority, the town of East Hartford?

         6      A     I believe it was East Hartford Section 8.

         7 He does inspections for East Hartford, that's what

         8 he told me.

         9      Q     For Section 8?

        10      A     Yes.

        11      Q     Did he put anything in writing?

        12            Sorry if I asked that.

        13      A     You asked that and I said no.

        14      Q     Thank you.

        15            And you don't remember what he told you?

        16      A     No.

        17      Q     Why did you contact him?

        18      A     It's my right.  I can do that.  It's

        19 not --

        20      Q     What made you contact him?

        21      A     Because I wanted to talk to him.

        22      Q     For what reason?

        23      A     I don't remember.

        24      Q     You remembered talking to him but you
                                                             76



         1 don't remember why?

         2      A     Right.

         3      Q     Okay.  With respect to Mr. Charles

         4 Stuart -- that's who you rented the apartment to in

         5 August of 2016?

         6      A     Right.

         7      Q     Okay.

         8      A     Not August.  Your dates are wrong.

         9      Q     Okay.  When did you rent it to him?

        10      A     He moved in October 1st --

        11      Q     Okay.

        12      A     -- 2016.

        13      Q     Okay.  When did he apply for the

        14 apartment?

        15      A     I don't know the date of that.  I think

        16 it was August.

        17      Q     So --

        18      A     Late --

        19      Q     -- August 2016?

        20      A     Late August, the end of August.

        21      Q     Okay.  So --

        22      A     So be specific with your dates.

        23      Q     My date was not incorrect then.  He

        24 applied in August --
                                                             77



         1      A     No, your date --

         2      Q     -- 2016.

         3      A     Your date is incorrect.  You said August.

         4 August could be August 1st, August -- in the

         5 application and the lease that I submitted, has the

         6 actual dates.  I don't recall and I cannot tell

         7 you --

         8      Q     Okay.

         9      A     -- at the moment.

        10      Q     So I do have a copy of the lease here

        11 somewhere.  Give me just a moment.

        12                (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No.

        13                13, Lease, was marked for

        14                identification.)

        15 BY MS. HELLER:

        16      Q     It has been marked as Plaintiff's

        17 Exhibit 13.

        18            Can you -- I'm going to take this one

        19 back.

        20            Can you let me know if this is the lease

        21 you signed with Charles Stuart?

        22      A     Looks like it.

        23                 MS. HELLER:  Attorney Kelly.

        24                 MR. KELLY:  Thank you.

         1 BY MS. HELLER:

         2      Q     Okay.  Can you flip through to just

         3 confirm that it is the lease you signed with Charles

         4 Stuart?

         5                (Whereupon, the court reporter

         6                requests clarification.)

         7                 THE WITNESS:  No, I'm talking to my

         8            attorney.

         9 BY MS. HELLER:

        10      Q     Well, we are still on the record so he

        11 needs to hear you.

        12      A     The date on the lease says "9/30/2016."

        13      Q     Okay.  Thank you.

        14            And were there any defects in the

        15 apartment when you rented it to him?

        16      A     Yes, there was a few.

        17      Q     What were they?

        18      A     I had to clean up the furnace and issues

        19 with the bathroom.

        20      Q     Were those still issues when he moved in?

        21      A     No, because he was living in a house and

        22 he had to -- he didn't want to move in right away

        23 because he had something going on -- personal issues

        24 that I don't want to discuss.  And he said he didn't
                                                             79



         1 want to move in right away, so he --

         2      Q     When did he move in?

         3      A     I just told you, October 1st.

         4      Q     Okay.  And did you run his credit report?

         5      A     He ran his credit report.

         6      Q     Did he provide a copy of it to you?

         7      A     He consented to running his credit

         8 report, but when I tried to run his credit report, I

         9 had an issue.  And so we discussed it amongst

        10 ourselves that he was going to do it.

        11      Q     Did he provide it to you?

        12      A     Yes.

        13      Q     What was his credit score?

        14      A     I can't give you that because he's not

        15 here and he doesn't consent to that.

        16      Q     I disagree.

        17      A     Well --

        18      Q     It's not privileged.

        19      A     It is.

        20      Q     It is relevant to this case.

        21      A     I will not discuss someone else's credit

        22 unless they are here.  He has to consent to be able

        23 to do that or he has to be here.  I'm sorry.

        24      Q     Can you please --
                                                             80



         1                 MR. POOLE:  Can we go off the record

         2            for a second?

         3                (Whereupon, there was a recess taken

         4                from 10:26 a.m. to 10:40 a.m.)

         5 BY MS. HELLER:

         6      Q     Did Mr. Stuart provide you with a copy of

         7 his credit report?

         8      A     Yes.

         9      Q     Do you still have that?

        10      A     No, ma'am.

        11      Q     What did you do with that?

        12      A     When I sold the house, I gave all the

        13 information back to --

        14                (Whereupon, the court reporter

        15                requests clarification.)

        16      A     -- to the new owners.

        17 BY MS. HELLER:

        18      Q     So you did not keep a copy of his credit

        19 report when you sold the house?

        20      A     No, ma'am.

        21      Q     Okay.  And that was in 2018; correct?

        22      A     I think it was 2017 -- I'm not sure about

        23 the year.  I think it was 2017.

        24      Q     It was after this lawsuit was filed,
                                                             81



         1 though?

         2      A     Yes.  But the house was on the market

         3 prior to that as well.

         4      Q     What was Mr. Stuart's credit score?

         5      A     Off the top of my head, I don't remember.

         6      Q     What was his race?

         7      A     White.

         8      Q     And did he have children?

         9      A     He had grandchildren.

        10      Q     Did they live with him?

        11      A     Two days out of the week.

        12      Q     Did anyone else live with him?

        13      A     No, not that I -- not that I know of, no.

        14      Q     Okay.

        15      A     What does his race matter?

        16      Q     I'm sorry.  I can't answer questions on

        17 the record in your deposition.

        18            So with respect Jennifer Briones,

        19 B-r-i-o-n-e-s, did she submit an application to rent

        20 the unit?

        21      A     She did.

        22      Q     Where is that application?

        23      A     I thought it was in the file.

        24      Q     Okay.  Well, I don't have a copy of it so
                                                             82



         1 did you look for it?

         2      A     No.  I thought you would get a copy of

         3 that.

         4      Q     Did you show Ms. Briones the property?

         5      A     Yes.

         6      Q     When was that?

         7      A     I do not remember the date, ma'am.

         8      Q     Did you sign a rental agreement with her?

         9      A     Yes.

        10      Q     When?

        11      A     Sometime in July.

        12      Q     And where is that rental agreement?

        13      A     Oh, if we signed a lease -- I'm sorry --

        14 a lease?

        15      Q     Yes.

        16      A     No lease was signed.

        17      Q     No lease was signed.

        18            When was she supposed to move in?

        19      A     August 1st.

        20      Q     Did you collect a deposit?

        21      A     Yes.

        22      Q     When was that collected?

        23      A     As soon as -- I don't know the dates.  I

        24 don't recall off the top of my head.
                                                             83



         1      Q     Did you refund that deposit to her?

         2      A     Yes, ma'am.

         3      Q     And so what account did you deposit it

         4 into?

         5      A     The only one I had, American Eagle, I

         6 believe.

         7      Q     Is that your personal checking account?

         8      A     Yes, ma'am.

         9      Q     Why did she cancel?

        10      A     No, she did not cancel.  That's your

        11 words.  She did not cancel.

        12            What happened was I had to return the

        13 deposit back to her because I couldn't repair stuff

        14 on the property and I couldn't accommodate her

        15 move-in date.  That's why I returned her deposit and

        16 there was something else, which I can't talk about.

        17      Q     You should talk about.

        18            What is the other thing you --

        19      A     It had to do with something with her

        20 personal -- between her and her other landlord.

        21                 MS. HELLER:  Okay.  Attorney Kelly,

        22            are you directing her not to answer this?

        23                 MR. KELLY:  No.

        24
                                                             84



         1 BY MS. HELLER:

         2      Q     What was it?

         3      A     I don't know.  It had something to do

         4 with her other landlord that he told me.

         5      Q     What did he tell you?

         6      A     That's hearsay.  I don't know how true

         7 that is but --

         8      Q     Okay.  So we don't know how true it is

         9 but what did he tell you?

        10      A     He told me she never pays the rent.

        11      Q     So that was why you refunded her deposit?

        12      A     Absolutely not.

        13      Q     Why did you refund her deposit?

        14      A     I just told you.  I could not accommodate

        15 her move-in date and so I had no choice but to

        16 return her deposit.

        17      Q     So what the other landlord told you was

        18 not a factor?

        19      A     Somewhat.

        20      Q     So it was a factor?

        21      A     To a certain extent, but it wasn't the

        22 determining factor.

        23      Q     Did Ms. Briones intend to use any type of

        24 assistance to pay her rent?
                                                             85



         1      A     I believe her -- I don't -- I don't

         2 recall.  I don't remember.

         3      Q     What was her race?

         4      A     I don't know.

         5            Why would that matter?

         6            I didn't ask her that.

         7      Q     Did you --

         8      A     I don't ask --

         9      Q     -- meet her in person?

        10      A     Just because I know someone, it doesn't

        11 mean I know if she was black, white.  I mean, I

        12 don't know.

        13      Q     Okay.  What would you guess?

        14      A     I don't do that.

        15                 MS. HELLER:  Attorney Kelly --

        16      A     She's a person --

        17 BY MS. HELLER:

        18      Q     Okay.

        19      A     -- who is looking for an apartment and I

        20 want to rent it to her.  That's all I care about.

        21      Q     What did you perceive her race to be?

        22      A     I don't perceive anything.  She's a

        23 person.

        24      Q     Did she have kids?
                                                             86



         1      A     Yes.

         2      Q     How many?

         3      A     Two.

         4      Q     And did -- were there any other members

         5 of the household?

         6      A     Her husband.

         7      Q     So it was Ms. Briones, her husband, and

         8 her two children and that's it?

         9      A     Uh-huh.

        10      Q     Sorry?

        11      A     Yes.

        12      Q     Why did you show the property to

        13 Mr. Stuart and Ms. Briones, but not to Ms. Cortes?

        14      A     A lot of things were involved in --

        15 during that period of time.  I had just got married,

        16 I was very sick, and I was just trying to rent my

        17 apartment.  I wasn't picking on the show this

        18 person, I'm not going to show this person; that was

        19 never the case.

        20      Q     Do you recall if you showed the property

        21 on August 7, 2016?

        22      A     I don't remember, ma'am.

        23      Q     Okay.  On that day you showed the

        24 apartment to someone named Lindsay?
                                                             87



         1      A     I don't know if they didn't fill out an

         2 application.  I don't recall.

         3      Q     She was moving from New Britain and made

         4 $3,900 a month.

         5            Does that trigger your memory at all?

         6      A     No, ma'am.

         7      Q     All right.  You were also contacted by

         8 someone named Elizabeth?

         9      A     In 2016?

        10            I don't remember that either.

        11      Q     Okay.  She was making $18,000 a year and

        12 using a Section 8 voucher to pay her rent?

        13      A     I don't remember that.

        14      Q     Elizabeth asked to see the property and

        15 you refused.

        16            Why?

        17      A     I can't answer that because I don't

        18 remember, ma'am.

        19      Q     Did you ever refuse to show the property

        20 to someone named Elizabeth to, your recollection?

        21      A     I do not know an Elizabeth and I don't

        22 remember.

        23      Q     You don't remember?

        24      A     I don't remember refusing to show my
                                                             88



         1 apartment to anyone.

         2      Q     Okay.  You told her that the apartment is

         3 not Section 8 ready?

         4      A     I had to fix -- I had to make repairs on

         5 my apartment.  That was the whole problem from the

         6 beginning.  It's a problem.  I didn't have the funds

         7 available to do what I had to do so --

         8      Q     So you told her it was not Section 8

         9 ready?

        10      A     I didn't say that.  You said that, not

        11 me.  I never told her that.

        12      Q     Okay.  Why did you show the apartment to

        13 Lindsay but not Elizabeth?

        14      A     Ma'am, I don't know because that happened

        15 so long ago.  I can't remember stuff like that.  I

        16 can't.

        17      Q     How did you decide who to show the

        18 apartment to?

        19      A     I -- I don't understand your question.

        20            How did I decide to show my apartment to

        21 who?

        22      Q     You had a lot of applicants.  You had a

        23 lot of interest.

        24            You had a lot of people contacting you
                                                             89



         1 about this apartment; correct?

         2      A     I had an open house.  Whoever showed up,

         3 showed up; whoever didn't come, didn't come.

         4      Q     So you didn't make individual

         5 appointments with people?

         6      A     Not -- most of the time, I would tell

         7 people I'm going to be here from this time to this

         8 time.  If they showed up, they came in, they saw the

         9 apartment.  If they returned the application, it

        10 would get processed.  If not -- I don't remember

        11 faces, names.

        12      Q     My question, though, is of all these

        13 people who expressed interest, how did you decide

        14 who you would show the apartment to and who you

        15 would not show the apartment to?

        16      A     I would -- I would ask the screening

        17 questions, my screening questions.

        18      Q     Okay.  So --

        19      A     If they met the criteria, if they were

        20 within, then I would show the apartment.  That's how

        21 I was doing it.

        22      Q     Would someone who made $18,000 a year

        23 qualify to rent your apartment?

        24      A     I'm not -- why would I --
                                                             90



         1                 THE WITNESS:  Why is she asking me

         2            this?

         3                 MR. KELLY:  You can answer it.

         4      A     Well, somebody -- it depends on the rent.

         5 No.  If I did three times the rent, no, they would

         6 not qualify for me.

         7 BY MS. HELLER:

         8      Q     If someone was making $18,000, you would

         9 be concerned you probably wouldn't want to rent it

        10 to them based on that salary; correct?

        11      A     They can't pay 14 -- or 1395, no, ma'am.

        12      Q     What if they also had assistance from

        13 Section 8, would they have qualified?

        14      A     Perhaps.

        15      Q     If someone told you they made $18,000 a

        16 year and I'm on Section 8, would you have shown them

        17 the apartment?

        18      A     Perhaps.  I never told anyone that they

        19 could not see my apartment, or your client, whatever

        20 her name is.  I never told her that she couldn't see

        21 my apartment.

        22      Q     Okay.  Well, did you tell her that her

        23 credit wasn't sufficient?

        24      A     I only went by what she told me, that's
                                                             91



         1 it.

         2      Q     Are you aware that a fair credit score

         3 can range from 630 to 689 points?

         4      A     My perception is fair is -- you asked me

         5 that earlier and I told you what my perception of

         6 what a fair credit score is.

         7      Q     Okay.

         8      A     And that's what my mentality was at that

         9 point in time.

        10      Q     Did you know that the property would not

        11 meet Section 8 requirements?

        12      A     Did I know?

        13            It didn't have no furnace.

        14            Don't they check the furnace?

        15            That's what I was told.

        16      Q     Who told you that?

        17      A     The guy from Section 8, Tim whatever his

        18 name is.

        19      Q     Tom perhaps?

        20      A     Yeah, Tom.

        21      Q     So Tom told you that --

        22      A     The furnace has to be working.

        23      Q     Tom told you that the furnace has to be

        24 working?
                                                             92



         1      A     That they check everything he said to me.

         2      Q     Why did you ask him that?

         3      A     Because it's my right to ask him.  I

         4 could ask him if I want to.  I'm a landlord.

         5      Q     But what made you decide to ask him?

         6      A     I felt like asking him.  I wanted to ask

         7 him.

         8      Q     Okay.  And was that before or after --

         9      A     I don't remember.

        10      Q     Let me finish my question, please.

        11            Was it before or after Maria contacted

        12 you?

        13      A     Maria who?

        14      Q     Maria Cuerda, who works for my agency.

        15      A     Oh, Maria has no bearing on anything I

        16 did in my apartment.  Trust me.

        17      Q     Did you talk to Tom before or after Maria

        18 contacted you?

        19      A     Way before.  I believe it was before.

        20      Q     Okay.  So before Maria contacted you, you

        21 knew that your apartment could not pass a Section 8

        22 inspection; correct?

        23      A     That's incorrect, because I -- anything

        24 that Maria said was incorrect, so I'm not going
                                                             93



         1 to --

         2                 MR. KELLY:  That's not --

         3 BY MS. HELLER:

         4      Q     That's not my question.

         5            You testified that you spoke to Tom

         6 before you spoke to Maria; correct?

         7      A     I said I might have.  I don't remember

         8 the dates.

         9      Q     Okay.  So after you spoke to Tom, you

        10 became aware that your apartment would not pass a

        11 Section 8 inspection?

        12      A     I-- I knew that already, ma'am.

        13      Q     How did you know that?

        14      A     Because I'm a landlord.

        15      Q     Okay.  So what did you learn in the

        16 course of being a landlord that made you aware that

        17 your apartment wouldn't pass a Section 8 inspection?

        18      A     They check everything.

        19      Q     How do you know that?

        20      A     The water, they test the water in the

        21 summertime.

        22            How do I know that?

        23            Let's see.  I grew up on Section 8.  My

        24 mom is on Section 8.  My sisters are on Section 8.
                                                             94



         1      Q     Okay.  So you are familiar with the

         2 program through your family members?

         3      A     Yes, ma'am.

         4      Q     So you knew about the inspections?

         5      A     I didn't need Maria to tell me anything.

         6      Q     That is not my question.  That is not

         7 responsive.

         8            So you knew about inspections?

         9      A     Yes.

        10      Q     And you knew what criteria they would be

        11 looking for?

        12      A     Who would be looking for?

        13      Q     An inspector --

        14      A     Oh --

        15      Q     -- for Section 8 --

        16      A     Yes, ma'am.

        17      Q     -- because you had personal experience

        18 with it?

        19      A     Yes, ma'am.

        20      Q     Okay.  So if you told someone it wasn't

        21 Section 8 ready, that would be based on your

        22 knowledge?

        23      A     Yes.

        24      Q     Okay.  Did you talk to anyone else about
                                                             95



         1 Section 8 other than Tom?

         2      A     No.

         3      Q     Okay.  Did you talk to anyone else at the

         4 East Hartford Housing Authority around or -- you

         5 know, in or about the summer of 2016?

         6      A     Nope.  I posted my apartment in the

         7 Section 8 housing probably a long time ago, but I

         8 never spoke to anyone.

         9      Q     What do you mean a long time ago?

        10      A     When I first bought my house, I was

        11 looking to see how -- you know, how to get in the

        12 program and stuff like that.  You have to list your

        13 property with them, with the Section 8., so I spoke

        14 to someone at that point.  But no, other than that,

        15 no.

        16      Q     So did you relist it in 2016 with --

        17      A     No, ma'am.

        18      Q     I need to finish my question before you

        19 answer.

        20            Did you relist it in 2016 with the East

        21 Hartford Housing Authority?

        22      A     No, ma'am.

        23      Q     Did you talk to your mom or your sister

        24 about Section 8 in August of 2016?
                                                             96



         1      A     (The witness shakes head.)

         2      Q     I need --

         3      A     No.

         4      Q     No.  So you do understand that Section 8

         5 is a program to aid low income people in paying

         6 their rent?

         7      A     Yes, ma'am.

         8      Q     You understand that people who have

         9 Section 8 receive government-sponsored vouchers?

        10      A     Yes, ma'am.

        11      Q     And you also understand that the

        12 government sponsors the payment assistance for the

        13 rent; correct?

        14      A     Yes, ma'am.

        15      Q     But you've never rented to someone with

        16 Section 8?

        17      A     No, ma'am.  I can tell you why.

        18      Q     Please do.

        19      A     Because my son, when I purchased the

        20 house, I purchased the house for my -- me and my

        21 family to live in.  My son lived next door and I

        22 lived next door, so there was never a reason for me

        23 to have anyone else.

        24            And then everyone that I knew was
                                                             97



         1 friends, so I never had to do nothing.  It wasn't

         2 because I didn't want to.

         3      Q     So your testimony today is that you only

         4 rented the apartment, both 58 and 60, to friends?

         5      A     My family member -- my son was living

         6 there.  Then, after that, my other son was living

         7 there.  And then, after that, a friend of mine,

         8 someone that I know, moved in and that's it.

         9      Q     Okay.  So I just want to make sure I

        10 understand -- and I'm not talking about your sons --

        11 okay? -- or yourself.

        12            But when the apartment was -- the

        13 apartments -- there's two, 58 and 60 -- when those

        14 were rented to people other than your immediate

        15 family members, 58 was only rented to one other

        16 family other than your sons; is that correct?

        17      A     Yes.

        18      Q     And that is a family who you had a

        19 personal connection with?

        20      A     I wouldn't say a personal connection

        21 with.  I knew them through someone else.  Someone

        22 else referred me to them.

        23      Q     You described them as friend?

        24      A     I did not hang out with them.  They were
                                                             98



         1 not my friends.  I treat all of my tenants like my

         2 friends.  I mean --

         3      Q     Okay.  But just a moment ago, you

         4 testified that you had rented it to your friends.

         5 That's why I'm asking.

         6      A     I said referrals of friends.  They gave

         7 me referrals of people that they know and stuff like

         8 that.

         9      Q     Okay.  So when you put No. 60 up for rent

        10 in August of 2016, was No. 58 rented to the people

        11 who were referred to you by friends?

        12      A     They were referred to me, yes.

        13      Q     Okay.  And so in terms of No. 60, was

        14 Charles Stuart a friend or a referral --

        15      A     No, ma'am.

        16      Q     -- from a friend?

        17            Please let me finish.  I know that's not

        18 how a normal conversation goes, but we have to get

        19 it in there.

        20            So, for the record, we'll go over that

        21 one again.

        22            So was Charles Stuart referred to you by

        23 a friend or was he a friend?

        24      A     He was not a friend and was not referred

         1 to me by a friend.

         2      Q     Okay.  Are you aware of how he learned

         3 about the apartment?

         4      A     I believe he said Craigslist.

         5      Q     So I'm going to offer another exhibit

         6 here.

         7                (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No.

        11      Q     This has been marked as Plaintiff's

        12 Exhibit 12.  And I'm just going to take this one

        13 back here.  And this --

        14                 MR. KELLY:  Thank you.

        15 BY MS. HELLER:

        16      Q     These were provided to us after our prior

        17 deposition.

        18            And these are Zillow messages that were

        19 sent to you; is that correct?

        20      A     Yes.  That's what it looks like, yup.

        21      Q     Okay.  Can you look through them, please?

        22      A     Yup.

        23      Q     Okay.  So are these the text messages --

        24 or Zillow messages -- excuse me.

         1            Are these the Zillow messages that you

         2 provided to your attorney to provide to us?

         3      A     Yes.

         4      Q     Okay.  And are these true and accurate

         5 copies of all the communications you received on

         6 Zillow?

         7      A     Yes, ma'am.

         8      Q     How did you find these?

         9      A     I opened my Zillow account and I just

        10 printed them out.

        11      Q     Okay.  So when people contacted you --

        12 when all of these people contacted you through

        13 Zillow, how did you respond to them?

        14      A     Some of them, I didn't respond to.  It's

        15 very difficult to keep track of everything.

        16      Q     I'm only asking you about the ones you

        17 did respond to.

        18            How did you respond to them?

        19      A     I can't remember, ma'am.

        20      Q     So did you respond to them by e-mail?

        21      A     I really don't remember.  Sorry.

        22      Q     Did you respond to them through Zillow?

        23      A     I don't remember.

        24      Q     Okay.  Did you call any of them?

         1      A     I don't remember.  Probably.

         2      Q     Did you text message any of them?

         3      A     I only text message people who text me.

         4 That's it.

         5      Q     So you didn't text anyone through

         6 Zillow -- who contacted you through Zillow?

         7      A     I don't remember, so I can't answer that.

         8      Q     How did you decide who that you would

         9 reach out to?

        10      A     I can't answer that because I don't

        11 remember.  I don't remember even reaching out to any

        12 of these people on here.  There were so many of

        13 them.  I would have to see the application and then

        14 I could tell you if I did this or that.  I can't --

        15 just by looking at these names, it doesn't bring

        16 anything back to me.

        17      Q     Okay.  I understand what you are saying,

        18 but you received many inquiries through Zillow.

        19            Is it your testimony that you did not

        20 reach out to any of them?

        21      A     I might have reached out to some.  But,

        22 like I said, if I don't have the application in

        23 front of me or-- I can't tell you that I spoke to

        24 this person or this person.  I can't say that.

         1      Q     Why did you have a Zillow account?

         2      A     Because I'm a landlord and I wanted to

         3 rent my apartment.

         4      Q     So you used Zillow for the purpose of

         5 renting your apartment?

         6      A     I had -- I had Craigslist.  Craigslist

         7 does Zillow.  It's like Hotmail, and it goes on and

         8 on like that.  I just posted my apartment on

         9 Craigslist.  So all this other stuff was extra.

        10      Q     Did you create a Zillow account?

        11      A     I had to in order to be able to go in,

        12 yes.

        13      Q     When did you do that?

        14      A     Probably in 2015.

        15      Q     Okay.  And so, when people contacted you

        16 about the apartment through Zillow, what did you do?

        17      A     If someone contacted me, I would give

        18 them my screening questions and then went from

        19 there.  That was the procedure.

        20      Q     How did you decide who you would reach

        21 back out to?

        22      A     I can't answer that because I don't -- I

        23 don't know what was happening at that point in time.

        24      Q     Okay.
                                                            103



         1      A     It depends on who I was talking to.  I

         2 don't know.

         3      Q     Well, do you agree that many people

         4 reached out to you?

         5      A     Yes.

         6      Q     Many people reached out to you through

         7 Zillow?

         8      A     According to this, it looks like a couple

         9 hundred.

        10      Q     Okay.

        11      A     I'm sure I don't reach out to all of

        12 these people.

        13      Q     I'm sure you didn't either, but that's

        14 why I'm wondering how you would decide who you would

        15 reach back out to.

        16      A     I don't have an answer because I don't

        17 remember, ma'am.

        18      Q     Okay.  I'm going to offer what was marked

        19 as Plaintiff's Exhibit 17.

         4 BY MS. HELLER:

         5      Q     Do you recall receiving an inquiry from

         6 Adnaloy Pagan as reflected on this page?

         7      A     Nope.

         8      Q     Do you know whether you responded to

         9 Adnaloy Pagan?

        10      A     No, ma'am.

        11      Q     Okay.  Thank you.  I'll take that.

        12            Why did you file for bankruptcy?

        13      A     That has nothing to do with this case.

        14 I'm not going to answer that.

        15                 MS. HELLER:  Are you directing her

        16            not to answer that?

        17                 MR. KELLY:  I'm not.  You can answer

        18            that.

        20      Q     Why did you file for bankruptcy?

        21      A     I have no money, financially broke.

        22      Q     And what did you hope to accomplish by

        23 filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy?

         8 2000.

        12      Q     Have you turned down any bonuses since

        19 Attorney Kelly so far?

        20      A     I don't -- I don't want to disclose that.

        21                 THE WITNESS:  Do I have to disclose

        22            that?

         1 BY MS. HELLER:

         2      Q     Did you pay him a retainer?

         3      A     Most lawyers ask for a retainer, yes.

         4      Q     How much was it?

         5      A     I don't remember off the top of my head.

         6      Q     Okay.  After you paid the retainer, did

         7 you pay any additional sums?

         8      A     He would have the look at that.  I don't

         9 know the number off the top of my head.

        10      Q     When was the last time you made a

        11 payment?

        12      A     In April -- no.  July.

        13      Q     Okay.  And are you aware of whether

        14 there's a balance in your retainer?

        15      A     There's no balance in my retainer.

        17 fees that you incur in the litigation of this case?

         7 that was provided to us through Attorney Kelly.

         8            Is this something you provided to him?

         9      A     Yup.

        10      Q     Is this a true and authentic copy of the

        11 closing disclosure for the property known as

        12 58-60 Jerry Road, East Hartford?

        13      A     Looks like it, yes.

        15      A     Looks like it.

        16      Q     So did you provide this document to

        18      A     This is missing some pages.

        19      Q     Right.  Just this page.

        20            Did you provide this page to him?

        21      A     Yes.

        22      Q     Okay.  So, in here, it indicates, on the

        23 very bottom, that you would be receiving $14,347.84?

         1      Q     And you previously testified that those

         2 funds were placed in a retirement account?

         3      A     No.  I didn't say that.

         4      Q     What happened to those funds?

         5      A     I had a loan -- outstanding loan that I

         6 took out from the house -- to do some work on the

         7 house from my 401(k), and I had to pay myself back

         8 because I couldn't -- they were taking it out from

         9 my check.

        10      Q     So you had a 401(k)?

        11      A     Yes, ma'am.

        12      Q     Is that an employer-sponsored 401(k)?

        13      A     Yes, ma'am.

        14      Q     Okay.  And so you used all $14,347 to pay

        15 back the loan?

        16      A     Yes.

        17      Q     What was the balance of the loan?

        18      A     I don't remember off the top of my head.

        19      Q     Okay.  Do you have any documents from

        20 that transaction?

        21      A     I do, but I don't understand how that

        22 pertains to this case.

        24 some basic questions here.  I'm going to -- if you

        19      Q     Did you make any efforts to look for

         1 free to print it off the website.  That's what

         2 Attorney Neil told me to do.

         3      Q     Okay.

         4                 MR. KELLY:  Referring to Attorney

         5            Neil Crane on that.

         6                 MS. HELLER:  Okay.  Thank you.

         7                 THE WITNESS:  He said it's public

         8            record.

         9 BY MS. HELLER:

        10      Q     Okay.  Thank you.  And we are going to

        11 circle back to Exhibit 11, which we have already

        12 introduced.  It's the letter dated April 9 from my

        13 office to Attorney Kelly.  So I just want to create

        14 a record of the items on there.

        15            In your Gmail account, did you search for

        16 the term "Jerry Road"?

        17      A     My Gmail account?

        18            Yes.  There's nothing.

        19      Q     Did you search for the term "Jerry Road"

        20 in your Travelers account?

        21      A     There's nothing in my Travelers account.

        22      Q     Did you search for it, though?

        23      A     Yes.  There's nothing, ma'am.

        24      Q     Did you search the term "apartment" in
                                                            116



         1 your Gmail?

         2      A     Yes.

         3      Q     There were no results?

         4      A     No, ma'am.  In my e-mail, nothing comes

         5 up.  It gets deleted actually after a certain amount

         6 of years, I was told.

         7      Q     Gmail?

         8      A     I'm talking about Travelers' accounts.

         9      Q     Okay.  I'm going to ask you about both,

        10 so let's be clear which one we are talking about.

        11 And I apologize if I wasn't clear.

        12            So in your Gmail account, did you search

        13 for the term "apartment"?

        14      A     Yes.

        15      Q     What were the results?

        16      A     I didn't get anything.

        17      Q     Zero results?

        18      A     I don't keep Gmail e-mails in my account.

        19 I told you that already.  I delete them.

        20      Q     You delete your Gmail?

        21      A     There's too many of them to keep up and

        22 most of it is pretty much junk mail.

        23      Q     When did you delete all of the e-mails

        24 related to the word "apartment"?
                                                            117



         1      A     I look through that periodically once

         2 they come up.

         3      Q     Have you done it since I filed this

         4 lawsuit?

         5      A     Not intentionally.  I mean, I just do

         6 that all the time.  I go through my e-mail and I hit

         7 delete, delete, delete.

         8      Q     So it's possible, since I filed this

         9 lawsuit, you've deleted e-mails that reference Jerry

        10 Road or the word "apartment;" is that correct?

        11      A     Maybe.  Yes.

        12      Q     And in your Travelers account, you also

        13 searched for the word "apartment"?

        14      A     If I do that in my G -- in my Travelers

        15 account, nothing will come up.

        16      Q     Did you do it?

        17      A     Yes.

        18      Q     Okay.  In your Gmail, did you search for

        19 the term "rent"?

        20      A     Rent?

        21            No, I didn't do that.

        22      Q     Okay.  Why not?

        23      A     Because there's no e-mails there, ma'am.

        24      Q     How would you know if you didn't search
                                                            118



         1 for it?

         2      A     I delete my e-mails all the time.

         3 Because, if not, my -- it will be too full.  I can't

         4 keep up.  They get deleted.  I have to delete them.

         5      Q     Okay.

         6      A     I only view my e-mail on my phone.

         7      Q     Okay.  So when you say you searched for

         8 these e-mails, it was only on your phone?

         9      A     No, ma'am.  That's -- that's what you

        10 said.  I said I searched my e-mail at work and

        11 there's nothing.  I told you that.

        12      Q     When you searched for your -- when you

        13 searched through your Gmail account, did you use

        14 your phone or another device?

        15      A     This.  My phone.

        16      Q     Your phone?

        17      A     (The witness nods head.)

        18      Q     You didn't use a desktop or --

        19      A     I don't have a desktop.

        20      Q     -- or laptop?

        21      A     I don't have that either.

        22      Q     Okay.  So you didn't use an Internet

        23 browser, you just used the app on your phone?

        24      A     Uh-huh.
                                                            119

         1 delete my e-mails periodically, because there's so

         2 many that comes in.

         3      Q     I understand --

         4      A     I've been doing that for years prior to

         5 you filing -- that's just how I operate.  I'm sorry.

         6 I don't have any.

         7      Q     Were you aware that you were being asked

         8 to search for these terms in preparation for today's

         9 deposition?  Yes or no?

        10      A     Yes.

        11      Q     So why didn't you do it?

        12      A     I didn't have to because I didn't have

        13 them.  I know I don't have them.  There's nothing

        14 there.  I searched the last time you requested them,

        15 and I couldn't locate anything.  Nothing was going

        16 to mir -- was going to show up there.

        17      Q     When did you search for these terms?

        18      A     After our deposition, first one, ma'am.

        19      Q     Okay.

        20      A     When you request -- that's what you

        21 requested me to do.

        22            I don't have any documents, ma'am.  I

        23 don't understand what you want -- what you are

        24 looking for.
                                                            123



         1      Q     I just want to know if you searched for

         2 these terms and I'm not understanding if you did or

         3 did not.

         4      A     I did not search for all those terms, no.

         5      Q     Never?

         6      A     I -- I wouldn't use the word "never."  I

         7 just didn't look for these terms.

         8      Q     Okay.  But you understood that I was

         9 asking you to do so as part of this deposition and

        10 for this lawsuit?

        11      A     Yes, ma'am.

        12      Q     Okay.  You testified previously -- and we

        13 can look back at this exhibit.  You testified

        14 previously about Plaintiff's Exhibit 16 that -- and

        15 correct me if I'm wrong -- but I understood your

        16 testimony to be that these e-mails were ones that

        17 you forwarded to yourself from your Gmail account.

        18            Am I correct in that understanding?

        19      A     I guess this is for my Travelers e-mail.

        20 It says it right here.

        21      Q     So these are from your Travelers account?

        22      A     Yup.

        23      Q     So they were not forwarded from your

        24 Gmail account?
                                                            124



         1      A     Anything that's in my Travelers e-mail, I

         2 forwarded it from my cell phone to my Travelers

         3 account, you know, this particular thing.  Because

         4 we were discussing something over the phone.

         5      Q     Okay.  So --

         6                 MR. KELLY:  I think earlier she said

         7            so she could print it out.

         8                 THE WITNESS:  Exactly.

         9 BY MS. HELLER:

        10      Q     Right.  But the question has not been

        11 answered yet.

        12            Are these e-mails that you see in

        13 Plaintiff's Exhibit 16 ones that you forwarded to

        14 your own Travelers account from your Gmail account?

        15      A     From my Travelers account --

        16      Q     From your Gmail to your Travelers?

        17      A     Yes.  This is what I -- this is what I

        18 did because I wanted --

        19      Q     Those came from --

        20      A     -- to print it out.

        21      Q     -- your Gmail account originally, and

        22 then you forwarded them to yourself to print them

        23 out?

        24      A     Uh-huh.
                                                            125



         1      Q     Where in there does it reference anything

         2 about your Gmail address?

         3      A     I don't know.  I don't see anything.

         4      Q     Okay.  So how do you know that those came

         5 from your Gmail address?

         6      A     Because that's where he would contact me,

         7 on my Gmail account or on my phone or text.

         8      Q     Okay.  So you had text messages with

         9 Mr. Stuart?

        10      A     I didn't say I had text messages.

        11      Q     You just did.

        12      A     I said maybe he contacted me through

        13 text.

        14                 MS. HELLER:  Okay.  Let the record

        15            reflect that Attorney Kelly was pointing

        16            something out to you.

        17                 Attorney Kelly, would you like to go

        18            on the record to tell us what you pointed

        19            out to your client?

        20                 MR. KELLY:  Sure.

        21                 MS. HELLER:  Okay.

        22                 MR. KELLY:  I'm not sure how her

        23            e-mail works, but it indicates "from

        24            Margaret Valentin" and then in
                                                            126



         1            parenthesis or -- mailed to

         2            MValent2@Travelers.com, which suggests

         3            that it was from some other source and

         4            mailed to the Travelers e-mail that she

         5            identified earlier.

         6                 THE WITNESS:  Because I wanted to

         7            print this.

         8                 MR. KELLY:  And I'm trying to see if

         9            that's what could -- possibly answering

        10            your question.

        11                 MR. POOLE:  Is there a pending

        12            question?

        13                 COURT REPORTER:  No.

        14                 MR. POOLE:  Let's go off the record

        15            for a second.

        16                (Whereupon, there was a discussion

        17                off the record.)

        18 BY MS. HELLER:

        19      Q     All right.  Just a couple more questions

        20 on e-mail.  I know we have gone over a lot about

        21 e-mail.

        22            Have you ever looked into a way to

        23 recover deleted e-mails?

        24      A     In my Gmail account?
                                                            127



         1      Q     In either Gmail or Travelers' account?

         2      A     You can't do it.  I tried.

         3      Q     So you did look into --

         4      A     Yes.

         5      Q     -- a way to -- sorry.  Let me finish the

         6 question.

         7            You did look into a way to recover

         8 e-mails in your Gmail account?

         9      A     Yes.

        10      Q     And you did look into a way to recover

        11 e-mails in your Travelers account?

        12      A     Yes.

        13      Q     And in those inquiries, you learned that

        14 you could not do it?

        15      A     Correct.

        16      Q     Okay.  Who did you contact at Gmail to

        17 figure that out?

        18      A     Well, I did, like, a history, like a

        19 search, you know, how can I retrieve my e-mails or

        20 deleted e-mails and it says you can't do it.  It

        21 only retains it for a certain amount of time.

        22      Q     Are you aware that Gmail has an archive?

        23      A     (The witness shakes head.)

        24                (Whereupon, the court reporter
                                                            128



         1                requests clarification.)

         2      A     I didn't say anything.

         3 BY MS. HELLER:

         4      Q     Are you aware that it has an archive

         5 function?

         6      A     No.

         7      Q     Okay.  When you swipe on an e-mail in

         8 your account, when you swipe left, it sends it to an

         9 archive.

        10            Were your aware of that?

        11      A     But then that -- that archive is deleted

        12 as well.  I delete my archives because it slow -- it

        13 doesn't -- it makes my phone slow, if I don't

        14 have -- if I have all that stuff on my phone.

        15      Q     Okay.  If you were able to recover any

        16 deleted e-mails, would any of them be responsive to

        17 the questions that -- to the search terms -- excuse

        18 me -- listed here on Plaintiff's Exhibit 11?

        19      A     I can't say for sure.  Maybe.

        20      Q     Okay.  For Travelers' e-mail, is it

        21 Outlook?

        22      A     Outlook, yeah.

        23      Q     Just circling back a couple questions.

        24            Since 2016, you obtained a new phone;
                                                            129



         1 correct?

         2      A     Correct.

         3      Q     When did you get that new phone?

         4      A     I've had two new phones since 2016 --

         5      Q     Okay.

         6      A     -- because one got wet and the other one

         7 just broke.

         8      Q     Okay.

         9      A     When did I get it?

        10            I don't remember.

        11      Q     Okay.  And has the number changed?

        12      A     Nope.

        13      Q     And who is the carrier?

        14      A     Sprint.

        15      Q     And has that changed since 2016?

        16      A     No.

        17      Q     Okay.  We talked about Ms. Briones' race

        18 and your testimony was that you weren't sure about

        19 her race.

        20            But what about her color?

        21            How would you describe her color?

        22      A     She's brown.

        23      Q     Okay.  And in terms of Mr. Stuart's

        24 documents, you testified previously that you
                                                            130



         1 provided them to the new owner of the property; is

         2 that correct?

         3      A     I was told I had to hand over everything

         4 to the new owner.  That's what I did.

         5      Q     Okay.  And the new owner of the property

         6 was Stacey L. Morris; is that correct?

         7      A     I believe that's her name, yeah.

         8      Q     Okay.  Aside from his credit report, what

         9 else did you give her or him?

        10            I'm not sure actually if Stacey is male

        11 or female but --

        12      A     Female.

        13            I gave her everything, pretty much.

        14      Q     Like what?

        15      A     Everything that I have, his documents,

        16 credit scores, whatnot, anything.

        17      Q     Did you save some of it?

        18      A     No.

        19      Q     Well -- but you did provide us with --

        20      A     I photocopied what I needed to photocopy,

        21 the application and everything, and then the rest I

        22 gave --

        23      Q     So you didn't save the credit report?

        24      A     I don't think I had the credit report --
                                                            131



         1      Q     So --

         2      A     -- so I don't think I gave them that at

         3 all.

         4      Q     Okay.  So Mr. Stuart did or did not give

         5 you a copy of his credit report?

         6      A     I don't remember, but I don't think I had

         7 a copy of it.  I think he just showed it to me, if I

         8 remember, with a copy of his driver's license.

         9      Q     Okay.  Did you provide the new owner with

        10 any documents concerning applicants?

        11      A     No.

        12      Q     Just Mr. Stuart?

        13      A     He was the only one living in the

        14 premises at the time.

        15      Q     So No. 58 was vacant?

        16      A     Yes, ma'am.

        17      Q     When did the tenants in No. 58 move out?

        18      A     I don't remember that either.

        19      Q     Was it before or after August 2016?

        20      A     In July some time.

        21      Q     July of what year?

        22      A     2017.

        23      Q     Okay.

        24      A     Right before the house was sold, in July
                                                            132



         1 or June.

         2      Q     Sorry.

         3            Say that again?

         4      A     Right before the house was sold in June

         5 or July.

         6      Q     Okay.

         7                 MR. KELLY:  Here.

         8      A     Seventeen, yeah.

         9                 MS. HELLER:  If we can go off the

        10            record for a moment.

        11                (Whereupon, there was a discussion

        12                off the record.)

        13 BY MS. HELLER:

        14      Q     Just a couple of follow-up questions.

        15            With respect to Tom, do you know his last

        16 name?

        17      A     No, I don't.

        18      Q     Okay.  Did Tom view the unit at 60 Jerry

        19 Road?

        20      A     No, ma'am.

        21      Q     Do you know Christine Paisley?

        22      A     No.

        23      Q     Have you ever heard of her?

        24      A     Never.
                                                            133



         1      Q     Okay.  Did any other building inspector

         2 view 60 Jerry Road in or about August 2016?

         3      A     No.

         4                 MS. HELLER:  Okay.  I think Attorney

         5            Nurse-Goodison has some questions.

         9 BY MS. NURSE-GOODISON:

        10      Q     Yes.  I have just a couple questions for

        11 you.

        12            You talked about having some screening

        13 questions that you posed to potential tenants.

        14            Can you go through what those questions

        15 are?

        16      A     I don't have them in front of me.  I gave

        17 you a copy.  They are standard screening questions.

        18 They are asking why are you moving, how many people

        19 are going to rent the unit, what's your move-in

        20 date.

        21            I believe I asked questions about credit

        22 and what's your annual income.  That's it.

        23      Q     Is there a question about the source of

        24 income other than a job?
                                                            134



         1      A     No, ma'am, absolutely not.

         2      Q     There's been lots of questions about your

         3 Travelers e-mail and your Gmail e-mail.  You

         4 indicated that you did a search in your Travelers

         5 e-mail regarding how do you retrieve -- I think your

         6 testimony was how do you retrieve deleted e-mails

         7 and it came up that you can't retrieve deleted

         8 e-mails.

         9            But you -- I think you also testified

        10 that you checked your Travelers e-mail for the term

        11 "apartment" and it came up with nothing.

        12            Did you use specific -- do you remember

        13 using any specific terms for your Travelers e-mail?

        14      A     The way our e-mail system is set up at

        15 Travelers is I don't have to -- if I don't save it

        16 in archive, it automatically gets deleted.  So when

        17 I went to the IT group and asked them if I send any

        18 e-mails from here and I need to retrieve them, they

        19 told me you cannot do that because you have to save

        20 them.  I didn't know that.

        21      Q     Okay.  Did you --

        22      A     So if there was an e-mail, I don't have

        23 it because I -- I -- even if I type in "apartment"

        24 or whatnot, they're system doesn't work like that.
                                                            135



         1      Q     Okay.  Did you ask the IT people to

         2 retrieve the e-mails?

         3      A     They cannot do it either.

         4      Q     The IT people actually told you that?

         5      A     Yes, ma'am.

         6      Q     And do you remember who from the IT

         7 department told you that?

         8      A     No.  Just -- we have our own -- our own

         9 unit there.  You know, we have two IT people working

        10 and they told me that was impossible to do.

        11      Q     Does the Travelers have IT employees that

        12 deal with the whole Travelers?

        13      A     Probably.  I'm pretty sure they do.

        14      Q     Okay.  Did you ask them?

        15      A     No, ma'am, I didn't go that far.

        16      Q     Okay.  Did you search the term

        17 "Craigslist" in your Travelers account?

        18      A     No.

        19      Q     Okay.

        20                 MS. NURSE-GOODISON:  I believe

        21            that's all I have.

        22                 MR. POOLE:  I've just got a couple

        23            quick ones.

        24
                                                            136



         1 BY MR. POOLE:

         2      Q     My name is Sheldon Poole.  I'm from

         3 Gordon & Rees.

         4            I just have a couple questions for you;

         5 okay?

         6      A     Yeah.

         7      Q     So it's my understanding that, at some

         8 point in 2016, you spoke with Tom, who you said

         9 works for Section 8; right?

        10      A     (The witness nods head.)

        11      Q     I need you to answer out loud, please.

        12      A     Yes.

        13      Q     And that Tom worked for what you believe

        14 was East Hartford Housing Authority; right?

        15      A     He's inspector for them, yeah.

        16      Q     And was it before or after you spoke with

        17 Tom that you knew that the apartment wouldn't

        18 qualify for Section 8?

        19      A     I testified that I don't remember the

        20 date.

        21      Q     Okay.  Did you rent the apartment -- the

        22 rental to Mr. Stuart was after speaking with this

        23 Tom?

        24      A     Mr. Stuart moved in in October and I
                                                            137



         1 don't recall when I spoke to Tom.

         2      Q     So speaking to Tom could have occurred

         3 after Mr. Stuart had moved in?

         4      A     I can't testify to that because I don't

         5 know the answer.

         6      Q     Was the furnace fixed before Mr. Stuart

         7 moved in?

         8      A     Yes.

         9      Q     Were the bathrooms fixed before

        10 Mr. Stuart moved in?

        11      A     The bathroom was fixed in September and

        12 he moved in in October, yes.

        13      Q     I believe you testified that you rented

        14 it to Mr. Stuart because he didn't have a rush to

        15 move in; is that correct?

        16      A     Correct.

        17      Q     Were you aware of the date when

        18 Ms. Cortes wanted to move in your apartment?

        19      A     I gather, from these complaint, I believe

        20 she was saying July.

        21      Q     Okay.  Did you ever ask if that date was

        22 flexible?

        23      A     I never spoke to Ms. Cortes about

        24 anything like that.  She just stated what she stated
                                                            138



         1 in her e-mail and that's it -- I mean in her text

         2 message and that was it.  We never had a

         3 conversation where -- I had to cancel an

         4 appointment.  That was it.

         5      Q     You never asked her if her move-in date

         6 was flexible?

         7      A     No.

         8                 MR. POOLE:  I believe that's all I

         9            have.

        10                 THE WITNESS:  I never asked any of

        11            my tenants -- prospective tenants if the

        12            move-in date was flexible, not just --

        13                 MS. HELLER:  There was no question

        14            pending.

        15                 THE WITNESS:  I know.  But I wanted

        16            to make sure that --

        17                 MS. HELLER:  I know.  Okay.  Move to

        18            strike that.

        19                 I have one other quick thing.

        20                 MR. KELLY:  Okay.

        21 BY MS. HELLER:

        22      Q     You mentioned earlier that you had a

        23 Craigslist account; correct?

        24      A     That's how I -- I posted the apartment,
                                                            139



         1 on Craigslist --

         2      Q     Okay.

         3      A     -- and there's nothing there.

         4      Q     So did you look in your Craigslist

         5 account?

         6      A     Yes.

         7      Q     So no one contacted you through

         8 Craigslist?

         9      A     I couldn't get on to my Craigslist

        10 account.

        11      Q     So you didn't look in it?

        12      A     No.  No.  I had to recreate the password

        13 and by the time I did that, if someone did,

        14 everything was gone already.

        15      Q     So is Craigslist like Zillow, where

        16 people can contact you and there's e-mails in your

        17 Craigslist account?

        18      A     I believe -- no.  I believe everything

        19 was done through Hotpad and Zillow --

        20      Q     But you --

        21      A     -- and phone calls.

        22      Q     -- you posted the ad on Craigslist?

        23      A     I know they would e-mail me on my phone

        24 and I would see it on my phone, or call.  Mostly
                                                            140



         1 phone calls or text messages is what I got.  That's

         2 it.

         3      Q     Okay.  So when someone contacted you in

         4 response to the Craigslist ad, you received an

         5 e-mail or a phone call?

         6      A     Yes.

         7      Q     Okay.  Did you print anything out from

         8 Craigslist prior to today's deposition?

         9      A     No.  Just the -- no, I did not.

        10      Q     Okay.  All right.

        11                 MS. HELLER:  I think we are done.

        12                 MR. KELLY:  Okay.  No questions.

        13                 MS. HELLER:  All right.  Cross?

        14                 MR. KELLY:  I don't have any

        15            questions.

        16                 MS. HELLER:  Great.  We are done.

        17                 COURT REPORTER:  Attorney Kelly,

        18            would you like to order a copy of the

        19            transcript?

        20                 MR. KELLY:  Please.

        21                 COURT REPORTER:  Do you like paper

        22            or electronic delivery?

        23                 MR. KELLY:  An e-mail please.

        24                 COURT REPORTER:  Sure.  Thank you.
                                                            141



         1                 MS. HELLER:  We did not offer an

         2            Exhibit 15, for the record.  So there is

         3            no Exhibit 15.

         4                 MR. KELLY:  Is that the only one you

         5            didn't offer?

         6                 MS. HELLER:  Yes.  So it will go

         7            from 14 to 16.

         8                 MR. KELLY:  All right.

         9                (Thereupon, the deposition was

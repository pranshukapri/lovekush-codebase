               3          The Witness herein, having first been

               4   duly sworn or affirmed by Apryl S. Montero, a

               5   Notary Public within and for the State of New

               6   York, was examined and testified as follows:

               7             THE REPORTER:  Please state your

               8        name for the record.

               9             THE WITNESS:  Dr. Jacqueline Moline.

              10             THE REPORTER:  Please state your

              11        current address for the record.

              12             THE WITNESS:  175 Community Drive,

              13        Great Neck, New York.

              14                     EXAMINATION

              15   BY ADAM MARTIN, ESQ.:

              16        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Moline.

              17        How are you?

              18        A.   I'm okay.

              19        Q.   This is Adam Martin.  I'm going to

              20   lead off.  I represent two of the defendants in

              21   the action.  I'll probably be asking the

              22   majority of the questions this morning.

              23             MR. MARTIN:  Before we get started,

              24        Mike, the usual stipulations?

              25             MR. JOYCE:  Yes.




                                                                  6
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2             MR. MARTIN:  All objections, except

               3        as to form, are waived until the time of

               4        trial, and an objection by one defendant

               5        is good for all?

               6             MR. JOYCE:  Correct.

               7             MR. MARTIN:  Would you like to have

               8        the doctor read and sign the transcript?

               9             MR. JOYCE:  No.

              10        Q.   Okay.  Dr. Moline, I know you've been

              11   deposed multiple times, so I'm going to skip the

              12   typical instructions as you're quite experienced

              13   at this.  I'll note, of course, that we are

              14   doing this by phone, and Attorney Joyce and the

              15   other attorneys are also on the phone, so if we

              16   can just do our best to pause after questions

              17   and answers to make sure we're both complete,

              18   and if Attorney Joyce has any objections he can

              19   get those in.  We'll just do the best that we

              20   can given our situation; okay?

              21        A.   Okay.

              22        Q.   And it's my understanding that you are

              23   in your office right now; is that correct?

              24        A.   Well, I'm in a conference room, so I'm

              25   actually in a conference room in my office




                                                                  7
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   suite.  I am not in my physical office.

               3        Q.   Okay.  And the only person there with

               4   you there, currently, is the court reporter;

               5   correct?

               6        A.   Correct.

               7        Q.   And my understanding is you've been

               8   retained by Attorney Joyce as an expert in the

               9   Susan Stewart matter; is that correct?

              10        A.   Yes.

              11        Q.   Do you remember when you were first

              12   contacted by Attorney Joyce or anyone from his

              13   office?

              14        A.   That's a very open-ended question.

              15        Are you speaking related to this case in

              16   particular, or ever?

              17        Q.   Yes, yes, related to the retention in

              18   the Susan Stewart case.

              19        A.   It was actually fairly recently.  It's

              20   been within the past, I would say, three weeks.

              21        Q.   Do you have the notice of deposition

              22   in front of you, Doctor?

              23        A.   I do not.

              24        Q.   Do you recall being sent the notice of

              25   deposition for this case?




                                                                  8
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   No.

               3             THE REPORTER:  I happen to have a

               4        copy, but I don't have the attachments.

               5             MR. MARTIN:  Okay.  Madam Court

               6        Reporter, if we could just mark it, what

               7        you have, as Exhibit 1, please.

               8             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit

               9        Number 1, a notice of deposition, was

              10        marked for identification as of this

              11        date.)

              12        Q.   Doctor, the notice of deposition you

              13   were just handled as Exhibit 1, am I correct, it

              14   does not have a schedule A attached to it?

              15        A.   You are correct.

              16        Q.   I'll represent to you that the notice

              17   of deposition we served had a schedule A

              18   requesting the production of certain documents.

              19        Since you did not see the notice of

              20   deposition, am I correct in the assumption that

              21   you did you not review the schedule A appended

              22   thereto?

              23        A.   That would be a correct assumption.

              24        Q.   Okay.  Did you bring anything with you

              25   to the deposition today?




                                                                  9
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   Yes.

               3        Q.   Okay.  What did you bring with you in

               4   your file?

               5        A.   I brought a copy of my notes, as well

               6   as some documents that were sent to me related

               7   to fiber release from MVA Associates.

               8        And I was provided with set of Defendant

               9   H.B. Fuller Company's responses to plaintiff's

              10   first standard set of liability interrogatories

              11   in a case entitled Mazzorana, M-A-Z-Z-O-R-A-N-A.

              12        I was provided with a document related to

              13   Bird & Son that is entitled An Introduction to

              14   Bird Asphalt Roofing Products.

              15        And I was provided with Kaiser Gypsum

              16   Company's 2004 supplemental responses to

              17   interrogatories in San Francisco County complex

              18   asbestos litigation.

              19        I also brought a copy of my CV, my

              20   reference and reliance list, household exposure

              21   references, and some abstracts of the articles

              22   that were referenced.

              23        Q.   Okay, thank you.

              24             MR. MARTIN:  Why don't we go through

              25        the somewhat tedious task of marking




                                                                 10

               2        those as exhibits, so if we could start

                                                                 12
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   Dr. Moline, which articles did you

               3   bring abstracts for?

               4        A.   There's a separate household exposure

               5   references list, and I brought the abstracts for

               6   all 45 of them.  It's all in one packet, so it

               7   can be marked as one packet.

               8             MR. MARTIN:  Let's do that.  Let's

               9        mark that household exposure reference

              10        list along with all the abstracts as the

              11        next exhibit, please.

              12             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit

              13        Number 9, a household exposure reference

              14        list with abstracts, was marked for

              15        identification as of this date.)

              16        Q.   Dr. Moline, we are were also provided

              17   with two letters from Attorney Joyce's office,

              18   dated August 13th.

              19        Do you have those with you?

              20        A.   No.

              21        Q.   I'll represent to you that one of the

              22   letters represents the inclusion of the

              23   product-specific documents, those being the Bird

              24   Incorporated, the H.B. Fuller, and Kaiser Gypsum

              25   documents, and the second one represent, depicts




                                                                 13
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   the inclusion of John Stewart's deposition

               3   transcript, decedent's medical records from

               4   South Shore Hospital, and decedent's medical

               5   records from Primary Care Medical Records from

               6   Compass Medical Braintree.

               7        Do you recall receiving those documents as

               8   well, Doctor?

               9        A.   Yes, but I received them

              10   electronically.  I don't have a copy of them

              11   printed out.

              12        Q.   That's fine.  The documents that we've

              13   marked as exhibits and the documents that I just

              14   referenced that were included with that

              15   correspondence, the deposition transcript and

              16   the medical records as well as the defendants'

              17   specific documents, does that represent

              18   everything you've reviewed in connection with

              19   this case?

              20        A.   Yes.

              21        Q.   Thank you.

              22        So there's nothing other than what we've

              23   discussed, any articles that you you've

              24   reviewed, that you looked at in connection with

              25   forming your opinion in this case?




                                                                 14
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   Well, that's an impossible question to

               3   answer, since the 45 articles referenced on the

               4   household abstracts are not the sum total of

               5   everything I've ever read in my life with

               6   respect to asbestos and its health affects.

               7        So I don't know quite how to answer your

               8   question as you phrased it, specifically related

               9   to the Stewart case, I haven't reviewed

              10   additional documents specifically.

              11        But I've certainly read articles that go to

              12   the fiber release from joint compound that are

              13   not referenced in the marked exhibits or things

              14   along those lines.  Some of them should be on my

              15   reference list.

              16        It's actually just a reference list.  It

              17   shouldn't say reliance list.

              18        Q.   Sure.  And those are just articles

              19   that you've read throughout your career as part

              20   of your preparation for various depos and your

              21   expert work; correct?

              22        A.   No.  I've read those articles because

              23   I'm in specialist in occupational medicine, and

              24   I deal with patients who have exposures to

              25   asbestos, and a side reason for reading them




                                                                 15
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   maybe be related to medicolegal work, but that

               3   is not the primary reason I have read all these

               4   articles.

               5        Q.   Fair enough.  Thank you.

               6        Were there any specific articles that you

               7   reviewed in the last three weeks, since your

               8   retention by Attorney Joyce, in connection in

               9   forming your opinions in this case?

              10        A.   Not specifically, apart from looking

              11   at some of the -- I have the articles that are

              12   referenced as abstracts electronically.  I

              13   didn't review any of the full articles.  I've

              14   reviewed them in the past, but I just printed

              15   our the abstracts so I would have something to

              16   bring with me that wasn't overly burdensome in

              17   terms of paper.

              18        Q.   Okay.  And other than the

              19   defendant-specific documents that you received

              20   from Attorney Joyce for H.B. Fuller and Kaiser

              21   Gypsum and Bird, did you review any other

              22   documents specifically related to the defendants

              23   in this case?

              24        A.   Apart from the MVA fiber release?

              25        Q.   Yes, yes.  Thank you.




                                                                 16
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   No.

               3        Q.   Doctor, the CV I have from you is

               4   dated August 26, 2019, which I think was

               5   yesterday.

               6        Is that what you have in front of you?

               7        A.   It is what I have in front of me.

               8        Q.   What's the most recent addition to

               9   that CV, if you know?

              10        A.   To be honest with you, I don't know

              11   what the most recent addition was.  There are

              12   some omissions on here that should have been

              13   listed on here.  I'm not quite sure why they are

              14   not, but maybe they are somewhere I haven't

              15   found them.

              16        The most recent addition would be the

              17   article that was in press, in the Journal of

              18   Clinical Psychiatry, but there should have been

              19   a couple of other things added that are not on

              20   there that I'm happy to share with you.

              21        Q.   Sure.  Any of those that haven't been

              22   added, do any of them relate to asbestos or

              23   asbestos-related disease?

              24        A.   I've been named to the scientific

              25   advisory committee for the Asbestos Disease




                                                                 17
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   Awareness Organization.  That is not added to

               3   this CV.

               4        I testified in Congress on June 11, 2019.

               5   It was to provide data related to the impact of

               6   the World Trade Center, but I believe asbestos

               7   was discussed as part of one of the exposures.

               8        Q.   And that's it?

               9        A.   I gave a presentation -- let me see if

              10   it's -- I gave a presentation about ovarian

              11   cancer and asbestos in April to the Asbestos

              12   Disease Awareness Organization.  I don't know if

              13   that was added.  It doesn't look like it was

              14   added.

              15        Q.   Are you currently in the process of

              16   writing or collaborating on any articles or

              17   studies that you anticipate to be peer-reviewed,

              18   but haven't come out yet, that relate to

              19   asbestos or asbestos-related disease?

              20        A.   Yes, and I do not discuss articles in

              21   print, because it's intellectual property.

              22   Until they are published, I don't discuss them.

              23        Q.   Beyond the correspondence from

              24   Attorney Joyce on August 13th enclosing

              25   materials, have you had any other discussions




                                                                 18
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   with Attorney Joyce or his office in connection

               3   with this case?

               4        A.   Apart from asking me -- we had an

               5   initial conversation about whether I would -- I

               6   could review the case.  That occurred before he

               7   sent me the information.

               8        And I had a brief discussion with him

               9   yesterday.

              10        Q.   And what was the context of

              11   yesterday's discussion?

              12        A.   That I would be deposed by some very

              13   nice lawyers and, basically, that he didn't

              14   think it would go too long, and just to make

              15   sure I had the received the documents since some

              16   of them were sent more recently related to fiber

              17   release from various products.

              18        Q.   I think we've covered it, but have you

              19   reviewed any reports from any other experts that

              20   were authorized in connection with the Susan

              21   Stewart case?

              22        A.   Unless they were -- no.  I mean,

              23   everything that I reviewed in terms of expert

              24   reports has been marked.

              25        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.




                                                                 19
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        You're still at North Shore University

               3   Hospital, Doctor?

               4        A.   Our corporate entity is now called

               5   Northwell Health, and one of the hospitals is

               6   North Shore University Hospital, that I have

               7   privileges at.

               8        Q.   Are you still seeing, actively seeing,

               9   patients?

              10        A.   Yes.

              11        Q.   I read this deposition from you two

              12   years ago in the Bouche case.  I think it was

              13   here in Massachusetts, so I don't want to

              14   belabor much of what was covered there.

              15        So in terms of the percentage of time you

              16   spend treating patients versus research, versus

              17   your expert litigation work, has the percentage

              18   of that work essentially remained the same over

              19   the last two years?

              20        A.   I think that, in general, yes.  I

              21   spend, apart from when I'm being deposed or at

              22   trial, most of the litigation work is done on

              23   off-hours or on vacation or -- you know, nights

              24   and weekends or before or after the normal

              25   workday.




                                                                 20
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        I still see patients one day a week, and I

               3   still am involved in a variety of clinical

               4   program oversight and research and

               5   administrative duties.

               6        Q.   Has the percentage of income that

               7   you're deriving from litigation consulting work

               8   consistent with what it was two years ago, which

               9   I believe you said was 30, 35 percent?

              10        A.   Actually, last year was a little

              11   higher.  It was about 45 to 50 percent which as

              12   anomalus.  I don't think it will be as high this

              13   year, but usually it's about 40 percent.

              14        Q.   Can you estimate or tell me what that

              15   amount was last year?

              16        A.   I cannot.

              17        Q.   Do you still charge 550 an hour,

              18   Doctor?

              19        A.   No.

              20        Q.   Okay.  What are your current rates?

              21        A.   600 an hour.

              22        Q.   And is that consistent for deposition,

              23   trial, and preparation work?

              24        A.   Yes.

              25        Although the deposition and trial work




                                                                 21
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   doesn't go to me.  It goes to the health system.

               3        Q.   Correct, thank you.

               4        You have not prepared a report specific to

               5   the Susan Stewart case; am I correct?

               6        A.   You are correct.

               7        Q.   And my assumption is that you were not

               8   asked to prepare one by Attorney Joyce; is that

               9   correct?

              10        A.   Yes.

              11        Q.   Were you asked to formulate causation

              12   opinions specific to the individual defendants

              13   in the case?

              14        A.   I have been asked for general

              15   causation.  I haven't been asked for

              16   defendant-specific.

              17        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

              18        Doctor, did you testify in any trials in

              19   2018?

              20        A.   Yes.

              21        Q.   Can you estimate for me how many?

              22        A.   I don't know exactly how many it was

              23   in 2018.  It's probably about -- I think I've

              24   testified in about 15 trials a year.

              25        Q.   How about so far this year in 2019?




                                                                 22
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   About six or eight.  I'm not exactly

               3   sure the number.

               4        Q.   Thank you.

               5        Are you aware of your testimony being

               6   excluded by any court in 2018 or 2019?

               7        A.   No.

               8        Q.   Thank you.

               9        Can you estimate for me, Doctor, how much

              10   time you've spent in reviewing and working on

              11   the Susan Stewart matter?

              12        A.   I think about six hours.  I would have

              13   to look at my notes, but I think it's about

              14   that.

              15        Q.   Thank you.

              16        Just a couple more background questions.

              17        Doctor, my understanding is you are

              18   certified in occupational and environmental

              19   medicine; is that correct?

              20        A.   You mean board-certified?  Yes.

              21        Q.   And you are not a board-certified

              22   pulmonologist?

              23        A.   Why don't I just go through everything

              24   I'm not.

              25        Q.   Sure.




                                                                 23
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   I'm not a pulmonologist.

               3        I'm not an oncologist.

               4        I'm not a toxicologist.

               5        I've taken industrial hygiene courses, but

               6   I'm not a certified industrial hygienist.

               7        I've taken epidemiology and statistics

               8   courses and have taught them, but I do not have

               9   a PhD in epidemiology.

              10        I'm not a pathologist.

              11        I'm not an electron microscopist.

              12        I'm not a material science person.

              13        I'm not to geologist.

              14        I'm not a safety engineer.

              15        Q.   Any new board certifications in the

              16   last two years?

              17        A.   That's like asking if you have a new

              18   bar association.

              19        No.  I don't.

              20        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

              21        Did you review Susan Stewart's medical

              22   records that you were provided?

              23        A.   I did.

              24        Q.   Okay.  And what were you look at

              25   Mrs. Stewart's medical records for?




                                                                 24
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   I was looking for her diagnosis,

               3   medical course.  I've looked to see if she, what

               4   her past medical history was, if there was

               5   relevant family history.  The general medical

               6   review that I do for all patients.

               7        Q.   And part of your handwritten notes are

               8   your notes from your review of her medical

               9   records; correct, Doctor?

              10        A.   My handwritten notes are the review of

              11   the medical records.  I do them

              12   contemporaneously.

              13        Q.   Thank you.

              14        And you weren't asked to provide any sort

              15   of diagnosis of Mr. Stewart's disease; am I

              16   correct?

              17        A.   Well, she's passed away, so I could

              18   not provide an active diagnosis.

              19        Q.   Were you asked to confirm the

              20   diagnosis?

              21        A.   I was asked, only in the sense, to say

              22   was there evidence that she, in fact, from the

              23   medical records had a mesothelioma, but that's

              24   the only way I would be able to review the

              25   medical records to confirm it.




                                                                 25
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   Sure.  And what was your opinion on

               3   that?

               4        A.   That she had malignant mesothelioma

               5   that was confirmed at pathologists at two

               6   organizations.

               7        Q.   Thank you.

               8        And I take it's obvious, but you never

               9   treated Mrs. Stewart; correct?

              10        A.   Correct.

              11        Q.   Did you review any actual X-rays or CT

              12   scans or pathology slides of Mrs. Stewart?

              13        A.   So I'm not a pathologist, as I said

              14   before, so I don't look at slides.

              15        I wasn't provided with any radiology, so I

              16   did not review them.

              17        Q.   Did you observe any reference in

              18   Mrs. Stewart's medical records to pleural

              19   plaques?

              20        A.   There was a references to pleural

              21   plaques in the PET/CT scan she had on the left

              22   side.  That was the only reference that I saw.

              23        Q.   Was there any reference to those

              24   plaques being asbestos-related, to your

              25   recollection?




                                                                 26
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   No.

               3        Q.   Did you observe any mention or

               4   reference of Mrs. Stewart having asbestosis?

               5        A.   No.

               6        Q.   Doctor, you said you're not a

               7   board-certified industrial hygienist, so am I

               8   correct that you don't do any dose

               9   reconstruction?

              10        A.   There's nothing such thing as a

              11   board-certified industrial hygienist.  It's

              12   called a certified industrial hygienist.  Board

              13   certification is typically referred to as a

              14   nomenclature for physicians, is my

              15   understanding.

              16        But I did not do a dose reconstruction in

              17   this case.

              18        Q.   In forming your opinions, generally,

              19   not specific to this case, do you ever review

              20   dose reconstructions that are performed by

              21   industrial hygienists to inform your opinion?

              22        A.   If it's provided, I will take a look

              23   at it, sure.  I mean, that's -- I have

              24   industrial hygiene training, and occupational

              25   medicine is a multidiscipline profession where




                                                                 27
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   we work with industrial hygienists all the time,

               3   so we work with them in that setting.

               4        It's fairly unusual that I see a dose

               5   reconstruction, because most people don't walk

               6   around with a dosimeter.

               7        Q.   Have you reviewed any dose

               8   reconstructions from any industrial hygienists

               9   specific to the Susan Stewart case?

              10        A.   No.  I haven't been provided with any

              11   other expert reports, as we talked about

              12   earlier, so there would be no way for me to do

              13   that.

              14        Q.   Thank you.

              15        Generally, Doctor, my understanding is that

              16   your opinion is that chrysotile asbestos can

              17   cause mesothelioma; am I correct?

              18        A.   My opinion and the general scientific

              19   community, yes.

              20        Q.   Okay.  And so someone can develop

              21   mesothelioma only -- strike that.

              22        So someone could develop mesothelioma even

              23   if their only known exposures are to chrysotile?

              24   Is that your opinion as well?

              25        A.   Can you rephrase that?




                                                                 28
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   Sure.

               3        Is it your opinion that someone who has

               4   only exposures to chrysotile may develop

               5   mesothelioma from those exposures?

               6        A.   If their only type of exposure to

               7   asbestos is chrysotile asbestos, yes, they can

               8   develop mesothelioma.

               9        Q.   But you'd also agree that there are

              10   other fiber types, including amosite and

              11   crocidolite, that are more carcinogenic than

              12   chrysotile on a fiber-per-fiber basis?

              13        A.   Depends what about disease you're

              14   talking about.

              15        Q.   Okay.  With respect to mesothelioma.

              16        A.   On a fiber-per-fiber base, yes.

              17        Q.   Do you have an order of magnitude by

              18   which you believe, starting with amosite, an

              19   order of magnitude to which it's more

              20   carcinogenic than chrysotile?

              21        A.   In the past, I've said it's about two

              22   and a half to four time more potent.

              23        Q.   And the same question for crocidolite?

              24        A.   About ten times more.

              25        Q.   Thank you.




                                                                 29
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        If an individual has exposure to chrysotile

               3   and amosite asbestos, are you able to attribute

               4   the disease to the exposures to one fiber type

               5   versus the other fiber type?

               6        A.   No.  It's a cumulative exposure.  It's

               7   impossible to separate that out.

               8        Q.   And that's with respect, the

               9   cumulative exposures, as to all types of fibers;

              10   correct?

              11        A.   Correct.  You cannot say it's only one

              12   or the other and the third isn't a contributing

              13   factor.

              14        Q.   With respect to the products at issue

              15   in the Susan Stewart case, did you read any

              16   materials describing the asbestos content of any

              17   of the particular products manufactured by the

              18   defendants?

              19        A.   I've read stuff in the past, and I was

              20   also provided with some of the exhibits that had

              21   the percentages with respect to the Fuller,

              22   Bird, and Kaiser Gypsum.

              23        I've also seen percentages of other types

              24   of joint compound.

              25        Q.   So specific to this case, we are




                                                                 30
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   discussing the product-specific documents that

               3   we already marked as exhibits; correct?

               4        A.   Correct.

               5        Q.   In determining potential exposures to

               6   asbestos from a particular product, do you

               7   consider whether the product is encapsulated?

               8        A.   With respect to how one might have an

               9   exposure?  I'm not quite sure I understand your

              10   question.

              11        Q.   Sure.  If a product -- strike that.

              12        If asbestos in a product is encapsulated

              13   and is not friable as it stands, there could be

              14   no fiber that the individual can inhale; is that

              15   true?

              16             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              17        A.   If the product is not friable or

              18   cannot be become airborne, then it's not -- I

              19   would not consider it, in a -- that state to be

              20   capable of causing disease.

              21        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

              22        So the encapsulated products, the

              23   encapsulated asbestos product must be

              24   manipulated in some way such that it would

              25   release asbestos fibers; correct?




                                                                 31
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   Correct.

               3        Q.   We touched on it briefly, Doctor, but

               4   from reading your past transcripts, my

               5   understanding, and I know this has been asked

               6   before, but so I have a chance to hear it from

               7   you:

               8        In determining someone's potential

               9   exposures and whether it could contribute to

              10   mesothelioma, you would assess the person's

              11   cumulative exposures to asbestos; is that

              12   correct?

              13        A.   Well, I assess the individual

              14   components, the constituents that make up the

              15   cumulative exposure, so I would look at the

              16   various things they have done, to look at how

              17   they would have their overall exposure, that

              18   would be the cumulative exposure, yes.

              19        Q.   Okay.  So in determining their or

              20   assessing their cumulative exposure, you look at

              21   their potential individual exposures that they

              22   had throughout their life via occupational or

              23   para-occupational exposures?

              24        A.   Correct.  There's other categories of

              25   exposure, too.  You look at all the exposures




                                                                 32
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   that one might have.

               3        Q.   All the potential exposures one

               4   individual may have, that is their cumulative

               5   exposure when put together; correct?

               6        A.   Correct.

               7        Q.   Do you distinguish between an exposure

               8   that is a contributing factor to disease versus

               9   an exposure that is a substantial contributing

              10   factor to the disease?

              11             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              12        A.   No.  That's just a semantic game you

              13   guys like to play.  It's --

              14        The exposures all contribute to one's

              15   cumulative exposure, and whether I used an

              16   adjective or adverb depends on the context of

              17   the sentence I'm using.

              18        Q.   Sure, and thank you for the

              19   clarification.  That was something I saw in a

              20   past transcript, and I wasn't clear on it, so I

              21   wanted to clear that up.  Thank you.

              22        You also agree, Doctor, that people are

              23   exposed to asbestos fibers from the ambient air?

              24        A.   The potential for exposure, yes.

              25        Q.   And you would agree the amount of




                                                                 33
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   asbestos in the ambient air differs from place

               3   to place or environment to environment; is that

               4   correct?

               5        A.   I mean, that's a very broad sweeping

               6   statement, but ambient air concentrations can

               7   vary by region, location, yes.

               8        Q.   Do you have any numerical figure that

               9   you typically attribute to ambient air

              10   exposures, in terms of per CC?

              11        A.   The most recent number, that I'm aware

              12   of, is an EPA document from, I think, either

              13   2011 or 2012, which is 0.00001 fibers per CC,

              14   and they don't differentiate between rural and

              15   urban.

              16        Q.   Was that four zeros after the decimal

              17   point?

              18        A.   That was.

              19        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

              20        Do you consider ambient air exposures that

              21   one might have as part of that individual's

              22   cumulative exposures?

              23        A.   In the sense that I view that as the

              24   foundation that people, everyone has, and then

              25   the additional exposures they have from the




                                                                 34
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   occupational, environmental, household,

               3   para-occupational, take-home exposures would be

               4   on top of that.

               5        Q.   And your understanding in this case is

               6   that Mrs. Stewart's exposures were take-home

               7   exposures; correct?

               8        A.   Correct.

               9        Q.   And did you read or see any reference

              10   to Mrs. Stewart personally working with

              11   asbestos-contained products?

              12        A.   I did not.

              13        Q.   And how do you define -- I know I read

              14   it, Doctor.  I'm sorry.  I just want to make

              15   sure I get the terminology right.

              16        How do you classify take-home exposures?

              17   They are not occupational, how do you classify

              18   them?

              19        A.   There are household exposures.  They

              20   can also by classified, in a general sense,

              21   environmental exposure, because they are not

              22   occupational, but either as take-home or

              23   household exposures.

              24        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

              25        Do you have any information about the fiber




                                                                 35
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   concentration of asbestos in the ambient air in

               3   the area where Mrs. Stewart lived in

               4   Massachusetts?

               5        A.   No.  I have not seen any specific air

               6   monitoring.

               7        Q.   And given the difference in asbestos

               8   concentration in ambient air in different parts

               9   of the country, urban versus rural, for example,

              10   it's possible that Mrs. Stewart's lifetime

              11   background exposures could be more or less than

              12   an individual that lived in a different area of

              13   the country; is that fair?

              14             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              15        A.   I wouldn't even know how to answer

              16   that question.  Everyone has their own exposure.

              17   I mean, one person lives in one area, and

              18   another person lives in another area.  Their

              19   exposures may be the same or they may be

              20   different.

              21        Q.   Okay.  Does a particular exposure to

              22   asbestos have to be above background levels for

              23   you to consider it as part of your cumulative

              24   exposure assessment?

              25        A.   Well, cumulative means everything that




                                                                 36
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   someone has been exposed to in general.  When

               3   I'm looking at specific exposures, I would

               4   consider them above background.

               5        Q.   And if they are below background, you

               6   would not consider them?

               7        A.   I don't know how you would have a

               8   below background.  That's an oxymoron.

               9        Q.   So you would consider any particular

              10   exposure to be above background; correct?

              11        A.   Can you rephrase that?  I don't

              12   understand quite how you are asking me the

              13   question the way you phrased it.

              14        Q.   So any occupational or environmental

              15   exposure is, by definition, going to be above

              16   background.

              17        A.   If there's an exposure --

              18        Q.   In your opinion?

              19        A.   No.  I think it all depends on the

              20   scenario.  If someone is walking by an intact

              21   floor tile, then they are not going to have any

              22   exposure, even though they are walking on an

              23   asbestos-containing material.

              24        So if they have to be exposed to asbestos

              25   that is airborne for it to be a meaningful




                                                                 37
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   exposure.

               3        Q.   If someone was walking by on one

               4   occasion while somebody disturbed or manipulated

               5   an asbestos-containing floor tile, would that be

               6   considered a meaningful exposure?

               7        A.   I would need more details to be able

               8   to talk about that.  It depends on what the

               9   manipulation was and how long they were there.

              10        If it was they stepped by it, I think it

              11   would probably be more in the de minimus

              12   category, but again, it would depend on the

              13   exact scenario.

              14        If they are shooting the, whatever, with

              15   somebody while they're manipulating floor tiles,

              16   then it could be meaningful exposure.  If

              17   there's standing there talking to someone who is

              18   scraping and cutting floor tiles, then that is a

              19   more meaningful exposure than if someone is just

              20   walking by.

              21        Q.   Do you have a numerical figure in

              22   terms of higher per CT exposure that is a cutoff

              23   between a de minimus and a meaningful exposure?

              24        A.   De minimus is going to be at

              25   background.




                                                                 38
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   Not to belabor it, Doctor, but my

               3   understanding is that any exposure to asbestos

               4   from an asbestos-containing product that a

               5   person may have, whether it be environmental or

               6   occupational or any other type of exposure, is

               7   therefore, by definition, above background and

               8   above de minimus?

               9             MR. JOYCE:  Are you asking her

              10        definition of the exposure; correct?

              11             MR. MARTIN:  Yes, her definition.

              12        Just trying to get on the same page.

              13        A.   I don't know if I can really answer

              14   your questions, because it's so general and so

              15   vague.  I'm not trying to be difficult here.

              16        I think if someone is walking by and has --

              17   you know, someone who is working with a floor

              18   tile that they are serving, that's a de minimus

              19   exposure compared to somebody who is standing

              20   there and working or talking to them for a

              21   while.

              22        So the exposures would be, in general, an

              23   order or two of magnitude above background in

              24   order for me to consider them.

              25        Q.   And are you able to ascribe a




                                                                 39
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   numerical fibers per CT or order of magnitude

               3   studio to exposures -- strike that.

               4        Do you need to see or rely upon an IH's

               5   reconstruction of potential exposure to

               6   determine whether or not it's an order of

               7   magnitude such that it's a meaningful exposure?

               8        A.   No.  If there's certainly scenarios

               9   where someone is manipulating a product that's

              10   known to contain asbestos, where it's not

              11   necessary if there's visible dust, for example,

              12   from the manipulation of an asbestos-containing

              13   product, that's going to be orders of magnitude

              14   above background.

              15        You don't need an industrial hygiene

              16   measurement of the countless, hundreds of

              17   thousands of exposure scenarios that have

              18   occurred in the United States alone.  I doubt

              19   that there have been industrial hygiene

              20   measurements for every time somebody was exposed

              21   to asbestos, but yet, it's possible to ascribe

              22   their exposures and subsequent diseases to those

              23   exposures, absent an industrial hygiene report.

              24             MR. JOYCE:  I'm sorry.  This is

              25        Michael Joyce.  I think I was cut off on




                                                                 40
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        that last question.

               3             Could the court reporter read back

               4        the last answer?

               5             (Whereupon, the requested testimony

               6        was read back by the reporter.)

               7        Q.   Doctor, where an exposure, a potential

               8   exposure, to asbestos is small and there's no

               9   visible dust and the exposure period is short,

              10   would you need an IH to determine or an IH

              11   report to determine whether or not that specific

              12   exposure is above or below background?

              13             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              14        A.   No.  It depends on the description,

              15   what the manipulation is of the various product,

              16   what the -- there aren't industrial hygiene

              17   reports for every exposure scenario.  I mean,

              18   that's a fallacy that one needs an industrial

              19   hygiene report, and it's not required under the

              20   Helsinki criteria for attribution of

              21   asbestos-related disease.

              22        Q.   Particular to this case, do you feel

              23   you need an industrial hygiene assessment to

              24   calculate Mrs. Stewart's potential take-home

              25   exposures to any particular defendant's




                                                                 41
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   products?

               3             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form as to

               4        the word calculation.

               5        A.   You know, I've been studying

               6   asbestos-related disease for 28 years, and I've

               7   encountered a number of individuals who have

               8   worked with the various products at issue in

               9   this case that are not particularly novel with

              10   respect to their ubiquitous nature and the

              11   construction realm during the timeframe in which

              12   Mrs. Stewart and her husband had these

              13   exposures.

              14        I don't think an industrial hygiene report

              15   is necessary, based my on my experience and my

              16   understanding of the medical literature with

              17   respect to many of these products or product

              18   categories, as well as the asbestos content that

              19   was identified as being present in the these

              20   compounds.

              21        Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

              22        Would you agree with me that Mr. Stewart

              23   did not work in the construction trade; correct?

              24        A.   He was not a construction worker,

              25   that's correct.  He worked in the supply side.




                                                                 42
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   And obviously, Mrs. Stewart did not

               3   work in the construction trade; correct?

               4        A.   Correct.

               5        He did do some construction, but that was

               6   not for pay.

               7        Q.   Right.  He did some small work on the

               8   family home; correct?

               9        A.   Correct.

              10        Q.   And would you agree that Mr. Stewart's

              11   exposure to construction-related materials would

              12   be less than your typical individual that worked

              13   in the construction trade?

              14        A.   It's a very broad topic.

              15             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              16        A.   I mean, you could have someone who

              17   worked in the construction trade who never

              18   worked around any asbestos-containing products,

              19   so it's hard to answer that question.

              20        Q.   Based on your review of Mr. Stewart's

              21   testimony, is it a fair representation that he

              22   was not working with or manipulating

              23   asbestos-containing products on a daily basis?

              24        A.   I'd be -- I don't know if he was

              25   specifically asked how often he was dealing with




                                                                 43
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   the various bags and various products, but he

               3   wasn't applying them on a daily basis, that's

               4   correct.

               5        Q.   And necessarily, Mrs. Stewart's

               6   exposure or take-home exposure is going to be

               7   less than Mr. Stewart's direct exposure; is that

               8   fair?

               9        A.   In general, yes.

              10        Although there are some studies that show

              11   that, in the act of shaking out clothes, the

              12   exposures can be similar to what the actual

              13   exposure is during the construction activity or

              14   the initial dust generating activity.

              15        Q.   Doctor, if a person's lifetime

              16   exposure to asbestos from a certain defendant's

              17   product is less than their lifetime background

              18   exposure, could you still attribute the exposure

              19   to that product as a cause of the person's

              20   mesothelioma?

              21             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              22        A.   So you're saying if an individual

              23   product exposure over the course of someone's

              24   life is less than background, which, meaning

              25   it's above background, would I attribute it?




                                                                 44
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   Correct.

               3        A.   No.

               4        Q.   Thank you.

               5             THE WITNESS:  We've been going about

               6        an hour, ten minutes, and 43 seconds.

               7             Can we take a three-minute comfort

               8        break?

               9             MR. MARTIN:  Of course, any time,

              10        Doctor.  Thank you.

              11             (Whereupon, a brief recess was

              12        taken.)

              13        Q.   Doctor, am I correct that you have not

              14   done any dose reconstructions for mathematical

              15   calculations to determine or calculate

              16   Mrs. Stewart's cumulative exposures to asbestos

              17   resulting from Mr. Stewart's handling of

              18   asbestos-containing products?

              19        A.   You are correct.

              20        Q.   And therefore, it follows that you

              21   haven't done any such calculations of her

              22   exposures to any specific defendant's product;

              23   am I correct?

              24        A.   That would be correct.

              25        Q.   And you have not done any calculations




                                                                 45
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   to determine whether her cumulative exposure to

               3   asbestos from the defendant's

               4   asbestos-containing products, by virtue of

               5   Mr. Stewart's work with those products, was more

               6   or less than her total background exposure

               7   during her lifetime?

               8             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

               9             Perhaps you can define what you mean

              10        by calculations.

              11             MR. MARTIN:  Sure.

              12        Q.   Any mathematical assessment in terms

              13   of fibers, fiber years or fibers per CC of her

              14   overall exposures?

              15        A.   I'm unaware of that data being

              16   available for me to even begin to attempt to do

              17   such a thing, so no.  I have not done any

              18   mathematical calculations of any exposures that

              19   Mrs. Stewart had.

              20        Q.   Are you able to say, then, whether

              21   Mrs. Stewart's exposures, her lifetime

              22   cumulative exposures, to a specific defendant's

              23   product were above her cumulative lifetime

              24   background exposure to asbestos?

              25        A.   In the sense that she had exposure




                                                                 46
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   from -- Mr. Stewart had these exposures to

               3   various products, such as the Bird felting that

               4   he cut, to the joint compound bags that broke,

               5   to the Fuller cement or Fuller thin-set that he

               6   was manipulating, that he carried with him on

               7   his body that she had exposure to and then

               8   transferred, in essence, to her, whether it was

               9   from physical contact or whether it was from

              10   being in the room with her or whether it was

              11   from the manipulation of his dusty clothes.

              12   That would be her exposure to the various

              13   products that he was working with.

              14        But there's no -- I have seen no

              15   information in relation to any dosimeters that

              16   were placed on her lifetime that would allow one

              17   to do a reasonable mathematical calculation.

              18        Q.   Thank you.

              19        And would you agree, Doctor, of course,

              20   that if a product does not contain asbestos, it

              21   cannot be a cause of Mrs. Stewart's

              22   mesothelioma; correct?

              23        A.   That would be correct.

              24        Q.   Doctor, when discussing cumulative

              25   exposure, the amount of a person's exposure is




                                                                 47
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   an important consideration to that assessment;

               3   correct.

               4        A.   You mean from each particular product,

               5   as it adds to their cumulative exposure?  I'm

               6   not sure what you mean.

               7        Q.   Correct.  If someone is exposed to a

               8   product a hundred times, that's more significant

               9   than someone is exposed to a product one time;

              10   correct?

              11        Assume that the levels of exposure are the

              12   same in each instance, individual instance.

              13        A.   In the sense of how much it adds to

              14   their cumulative exposure, yes.

              15        With respect to how it might cause disease,

              16   we don't have those answers.

              17        Q.   Okay.  So a hypothetical:

              18        If someone were a logger in a shipyard

              19   working with amosite-containing asbestos every

              20   day or every workday for 20 years, and on one

              21   other occasion scraped of a

              22   chrysotile-containing gasket, would you, would

              23   it be your opinion that each exposure

              24   contributed equally to the development of a

              25   disease?




                                                                 48
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   You're asking me a hypothetical that

               3   has absolutely no relation to the exposures

               4   discussed in the Stewart case.

               5        I just want to get that clear; is that

               6   correct?

               7        Q.   That's clear, yes.

               8        A.   So that would be, if you're looking at

               9   it in those context as somebody who is working

              10   with asbestos for 20 years, it doesn't matter

              11   what the product is, but day-in, day-out they

              12   are working with a particular product versus one

              13   particular exposure, then I think it would be

              14   difficult to ascribe their disease to that one

              15   particular exposure on one day.

              16        That is different from an exposure that

              17   they had over the course of 7300 days of

              18   exposure, where they had eight hours a day for

              19   7300 days or minus the weekends.

              20        Q.   And this is just going to the idea,

              21   Doctor, that the frequency or regularity with

              22   which one is exposed to asbestos from a specific

              23   product, that's important to your assessment of

              24   whether that exposure was causative of the

              25   disease; is that correct?




                                                                 49
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   As a general statement, the frequency

               3   goes to the overall dose.

               4        I think that it's challenging to answer

               5   questions that are very hypothetical, since we

               6   don't know all there is to know about how the

               7   various fibers interact with each other once

               8   they are in the body.

               9        Q.   The proximity of an individual to the

              10   fiber, asbestos fibers, is also an important

              11   consideration in determining causation; is that

              12   fair?

              13        A.   Well, that goes to dose with respect

              14   to if someone is working with it or working

              15   adjacent to it, versus being 15 or 20 feet away.

              16   They are going to, theoretically, have a lower

              17   exposure if they are 15 or 20 feet away than

              18   someone who is directly manipulating it or

              19   adjacent to someone who is directly manipulating

              20   it.

              21        Q.   In forming your opinions as to

              22   individual defendants in this case, did you

              23   consider the frequency, duration, and proximity

              24   of Mrs. Stewart's take-home exposures to those

              25   products?




                                                                 50
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   In the sense that the frequency with

               3   which her husband used those products, I think

               4   he wasn't asked a lot of those questions with

               5   great specificity, in terms of those questions

               6   in his deposition.

               7        But certainly, with respect to what was

               8   frequently sold at the various places, whether

               9   it was at the Plywood Ranch or Grossman's where

              10   he was dealing with these various products over

              11   his career, I certainly looked at what products

              12   he was describing with respect to how that would

              13   lead to his exposure, which would, in turn, lead

              14   to Mrs. Stewart's exposure.

              15        Q.   Are you familiar with the term

              16   excursion limit, Dr. Moline?

              17        A.   Are you talking about the OSHA

              18   excursion limit?

              19        Q.   Correct.

              20        A.   Yes.

              21        Q.   And am I correct that there's one

              22   fiber per CC over the course of 30 minutes?

              23        A.   I thought it was .2 fibers per CC over

              24   30 minutes, but I haven't looked at the

              25   excursion limit for a while.  I thought it was




                                                                 51
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   less.

               3        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any reason to

               4   believe that any of Mrs. Stewart's individual

               5   exposures exceeded that limit, the .2?

               6        A.   It's certainly possible, based on the

               7   literature with respect to what the fiber

               8   concentrations have been measured doing laundry,

               9   that they would have been above .2 or even one

              10   fiber per CC.

              11        Q.   And that's just based on literature

              12   review, nothing specific to this case; correct?

              13        A.   Well, again, there's no

              14   exposure-specific information with respect to

              15   the dosimeters or actual dose that Mrs. Stewart

              16   had, so I have to rely on the literature in

              17   these cases.

              18        Q.   Understanding that OSHA sets an

              19   exposure limit over an eight-hour time weighted

              20   average of .1 fibers per CC --

              21        Well, first of all, am I correct, is it

              22   your understanding of the OSHA eight-hour time

              23   weighted average is .1 fibers per CC?

              24        A.   Yes.

              25        Q.   And you would agree with me that




                                                                 52
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   Mrs. Stewart was not exposed to asbestos eight

               3   hours a day in an occupational setting; is that

               4   correct?

               5        A.   Correct.

               6        Q.   Do you have anything on which you can

               7   rely to opine that her exposures would have

               8   exceed that OSHA standard?

               9        A.   Again, first of all, OSHA has

              10   absolutely no relevance to Mrs. Stewart's

              11   particular exposure since she was not employed

              12   and she would fall under, so OSHA doesn't apply

              13   to her exposure as a take-home exposure.

              14        With respect, again, there's been no actual

              15   measurements that were done at Mrs. Stewart's

              16   home or the laundromats while she was shaking

              17   out the clothes.  With respect to what the

              18   actual measurements were, there were no actual

              19   measurements done, but based on the literature,

              20   the numbers are certainly higher than .1 fiber

              21   per CC, and they have been reported as higher

              22   than the excursion limits.

              23        Q.   And that's during the act of washing

              24   the clothes, correct, or shaking them out?

              25        A.   Correct.




                                                                 53
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   All right.  Doctor, we talked about

               3   occupational exposures and background exposures.

               4   There's also the opportunity for what I'll

               5   describe as environmental exposure to asbestos;

               6   is that correct, for example, living near a

               7   factory using or emitting asbestos fibers?

               8        A.   Yes.

               9        Q.   And it's possible that someone that

              10   lived near a factory or other plant or shipyard

              11   that emitting asbestos fibers may have a higher

              12   exposure to asbestos from the background air

              13   than someone who does not live near such a

              14   central location?

              15        A.   That's correct.  Someone who lives

              16   near a factory that's emitting asbestos into the

              17   air would have a potential for a higher exposure

              18   than someone who is not living near a factory

              19   that is not emitting asbestos.

              20        Q.   And shipyards are one of those types

              21   of locations we are understood to emit asbestos

              22   fiber into the surrounding areas; correct?

              23        A.   Surrounding area of the shipyard, yes.

              24   I don't know how far the measurements extend

              25   beyond the shipyards, which, in general, are




                                                                 54
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   fairly large.

               3        Q.   You've read articles regarding

               4   environmental exposure in shipyards, and you've

               5   testified on those before; is that correct?

               6        A.   I've certainly talked about folks that

               7   have worked in shipyards, but I don't know if

               8   I've talked about the environment around

               9   shipyards.  I might have.

              10        Q.   Are you aware of any studies

              11   suggesting that the rates of mesothelioma may be

              12   higher in areas near shipyards?

              13        A.   Well, it depends on who they are

              14   measuring, because of the people living near a

              15   shipyard are also working at a shipyard and

              16   their family members are dealing with the fact

              17   that their spouses or children are bringing home

              18   their asbestos-laden clothes from the shipyards,

              19   so the rates are going to be higher in the

              20   community.

              21        So it depends if you're asking me is it

              22   from the general environment versus the people

              23   who work and live near the shipyard.

              24        Q.   Sure.  I'm asking in the general

              25   environment, so not people that worked there or




                                                                 55
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   were exposed to those that did work there, but

               3   someone living in the community.

               4        Are you aware of any studies suggesting

               5   that incidents of mesothelioma may be higher for

               6   those that fit that description, that live near

               7   shipyards?

               8        A.   I'm aware of various factories.  I'm

               9   sure there probably are studies related to the

              10   shipyard.  I can't specifically think of one

              11   now.

              12        Q.   And would it be fair, Doctor, that, in

              13   your opinion, in looking at potential

              14   environmental exposures to those living near a

              15   shipyard, there would numerous factors to

              16   consider, including distance from the shipyard,

              17   wind direction, things of that nature?

              18        A.   Products used in the shipyard --

              19        Q.   Sure.

              20        A.   There are a variety of factors, yes.

              21   You would, in order to have an effective

              22   assessment, you would need air monitoring in the

              23   community.

              24        Q.   You'd agree with me, Dr. Moline, that

              25   shipyards in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s generally




                                                                 56
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   used significant amounts of amosite asbestos?

               3        A.   They used -- that wasn't the only type

               4   of asbestos they used, but they used amosite,

               5   yes.

               6        Q.   And would some of that asbestos,

               7   amosite asbestos and other types of asbestos, be

               8   emitted into the environment near the shipyard?

               9        A.   In the environment right around the

              10   shipyard, yes.

              11        Q.   Do you have any familiarity with the

              12   Four River Shipyard in Quincy, Mass?

              13        A.   Did you say Four River?

              14        Q.   Yes.

              15        A.   I've heard of it I don't have any

              16   familiarity with it.  I've seen its name.

              17        Q.   Okay.  If I represented to you that

              18   that shipyard built both commercial and naval

              19   ships from the '50s through the '70s, at least,

              20   would you have any reason to disagree with that?

              21        A.   I wouldn't be able to comment on what

              22   they did there.

              23        Q.   And from your experience, would you

              24   agree that the construction of those ships and

              25   overhaul of ships likely utilized asbestos




                                                                 57
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   during that time period?

               3        A.   Within the ships themselves, yes.  I

               4   mean, it's not like asbestos was used on top of

               5   the ship.  It was used in the engine rooms, the

               6   boilers rooms, on the pipes in the ship, on the

               7   bulkheads, and confined spaces in the ships.  It

               8   wasn't like the ship was painted with asbestos

               9   or the masts or the deck was made of asbestos.

              10        Certainly, within the ship itself, in the

              11   below-deck, there would have been asbestos.

              12        Q.   If you were made aware or informed

              13   that the town where Mrs. Stewart grew up and

              14   spent most of her life bordered Quincy,

              15   Massachusetts, in the area where the shipyard

              16   was present, would potential environmental

              17   exposures from the ambient air from the shipyard

              18   be something that you would consider in your

              19   assessment of her cumulative exposure to

              20   asbestos?

              21             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to the form of

              22        the question.  Assumes facts not in the

              23        record.  It calls for speculation.

              24        A.   I would need more information about so

              25   many things to be able to give an opinion to a




                                                                 58
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   reasonable degree of medical certainty with

               3   respect to that question.

               4        Q.   Is there a distance from a shipyard --

               5   strike that.

               6        Doctor, I'm going to move on to a few

               7   client-specific lines of questioning, if you're

               8   ready to continue.

               9        A.   That would be awesome.

              10        Q.   Okay.  Specific to this case, and we

              11   may have covered this, and I apologize if we

              12   did, if you feel we did --

              13        But did you review any specific articles or

              14   studies regarding exposure to asbestos from

              15   roofing products as part of your review of this

              16   case?

              17        A.   Only -- I mean, I was provided with

              18   the Bird document.  That's Exhibit 5.

              19        Other than that, I don't believe I looked

              20   at any specific article in the past three weeks.

              21        Q.   So if you may have read articles

              22   related to incidents of mesothelioma or asbestos

              23   exposure in roofers, for example, in the past,

              24   but not in the three weeks that you've been

              25   retained in this case?




                                                                 59
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   That's correct.  I certainly have read

               3   articles where exposure to roofing, I've had

               4   patients who were roofers, so I've studied it in

               5   the past.

               6        Specifically related to this case, I

               7   haven't reviewed any articles recently apart

               8   from the Bird document.

               9        Q.   And I think we've covered it, but

              10   you'd agree with me, in terms of occupation,

              11   Mr. Stewart was not a roofer; correct?

              12        A.   That is correct.

              13        He did do a little bit of roofing, but I

              14   mean, he did, he reroofed his house, but did

              15   not -- he was not a roofer by occupation.

              16        Q.   And there's no suggestion that

              17   Mr. Stewart ever did any roofing work on

              18   commercial or industrial buildings?

              19        A.   Correct.

              20        Q.   If you would, Doctor, if you could

              21   just give me your understanding of Mr. Stewart's

              22   work with Bird roofing products?

              23        A.   He worked selling the Bird felt paper.

              24   He had to cut the rolls with a hand saw or a

              25   circular saw and also sold joist paper, which




                                                                 60
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   was described as the same as felt paper.  He

               3   also manipulated Bird-impregnated,

               4   asphalt-impregnated shingles, when he was

               5   working both at the Plywood Ranch and the

               6   different facilities, as well as when he was at

               7   Grossman's.

               8        Q.   You don't hold yourself out as having

               9   any specialized knowledge of roofing products or

              10   their composition, do you, Doctor?

              11        A.   No.

              12        Q.   So to determine, for example, the

              13   asbestos content of any specific roofing

              14   product, would you need to look to literature or

              15   materials that analyzed that product?

              16        A.   Well, it's rampant in the medical

              17   literature that roofing materials contained

              18   asbestos.

              19        With respect to an individual product, I

              20   would need to look at a material safety data

              21   sheet or other document that would give me the

              22   information related to the asbestos content of a

              23   particular brand or product, yes.

              24        Q.   Okay.  And have you done that for any

              25   of the Bird roofing products at issue in this




                                                                 61
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   case?

               3        A.   Well, I was provided a document that

               4   said that the Bird felt had to have the -- the

               5   standard was that it had to have an 85 percent

               6   asbestos minimum per the specs, with respect to

               7   this case.

               8        Q.   And the only Bird materials you were

               9   sent were discussing the felt, correct, not the

              10   shingles?

              11        A.   I was, in this particular one, yes, I

              12   was only provided with an excerpt, and it did

              13   not have the shingles.  It was just on the

              14   rolled material.

              15        Q.   And did you glean an understanding,

              16   from reviewing those few pages regarding the

              17   felt, that there was a significant amount of

              18   Bird felt that was made on an organic felt that

              19   did not contain asbestos?

              20        A.   An organic felt?

              21        Q.   Correct.

              22        A.   You're telling me that roofs are now

              23   organic?

              24        Q.   I can point you to a specific

              25   document, if you'd like, and we can talk about




                                                                 62
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   it.

               3        A.   I don't recall looking at it.

               4        I think we're talking about organic in

               5   different ways.

               6        But it says organic felt was used as the

               7   base, except for their asbestos and their

               8   asbestos sheet, where the asbestos felt was

               9   85 percent.

              10        Q.   And I'll just direct your attention to

              11   the next paragraph, and the first sentence,

              12   which says:

              13        The organic felt, which is used in the

              14   manufacture of asphalt roofing --

              15        A.   Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You're being mean

              16   to her.

              17        Q.   What?

              18        A.   You're being mean to the court

              19   reporter.  You're talking way too fast.

              20             THE REPORTER:  Please read slowly

              21        when you read.

              22             MR. MARTIN:  Sure.  Of course.  My

              23        apologies.

              24        Q.   I direct your attention, Doctor, to

              25   the second paragraph of that same page, the




                                                                 63
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   initial sentence, which says:

               3        The organic felt, which is used in the

               4   manufacture of asphalt roofing is essentially a

               5   paper product.

               6        Do you see that?

               7        A.   I do.

               8        Q.   Okay.  And this just goes to the

               9   proposition that, in order for the manipulation

              10   of a product to lead to an exposure to asbestos

              11   for an individual, that product has to contain

              12   asbestos; correct?

              13        A.   Your preface to the sentence, I don't

              14   quite understand in the context.

              15        In order for them to have asbestos

              16   exposure, the product has to have asbestos.

              17        Q.   And you never did any -- strike that.

              18        You're not aware of any physical samples of

              19   the roofing products that Mr. Stewart worked

              20   with, are you?

              21        A.   No.

              22        Q.   And you're not aware of any testing,

              23   composition or material testing, of any of the

              24   roofing products that Mr. Stewart actually

              25   handled or manipulated; correct?




                                                                 64
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   I have not been provided with any of

               3   that data.

               4        Q.   With regard to the perforated felt,

               5   and I'm looking at the last page, Doctor, of the

               6   Bird, which I guess is Exhibit 5 --

               7        A.   Yeah.

               8        Q.   I believe it's the last sentence.  It

               9   says -- no, second to last sentence:

              10        This felt is used in both the 15-pound

              11   perforated asbestos-saturated asphalt felt and

              12   the 45-pound asbestos base sheets.

              13        Do you see that?

              14        A.   Yes.

              15        Q.   Is it your understanding, or do you

              16   agree with me from reading that document, that

              17   the asbestos felt was an asphalt-saturated felt?

              18        A.   Yes.  Well, with respect to the

              19   perforated asphalt-saturated felt, it says it's

              20   an asphalt-saturated felt.

              21        It does not say that for the 45-pound

              22   asbestos base sheet.  It doesn't have the word

              23   saturated.

              24        Q.   Yes, that's true, and thank you for

              25   pointing that out.




                                                                 65
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        There's no testimony from Mr. Stewart that

               3   we worked with any 45-pound asbestos base sheet

               4   that you say; correct?

               5        A.   Correct.

               6        Q.   Do you have an opinion or do you know

               7   whether the asphalt saturation of the felt would

               8   encapsulate the asbestos in the products?

               9        A.   I don't know if it would -- I don't

              10   have any information related to that with

              11   respect to its ability to fully saturate.  My

              12   recollection of seeing some pictures of the felt

              13   is that, even when it's been saturated, you can

              14   still see that it has a fibrous element to it,

              15   so I wouldn't be able to speak to it more

              16   specifically.

              17        Q.   Have you ever seen any studies or dose

              18   reconstructions that assess any potential fiber

              19   release simply from the handling as opposed to

              20   the cutting or manipulation of asbestos roofing

              21   felt?

              22        A.   I'm not sure.

              23        Q.   Okay.  What is your recollection of

              24   the number of times that Mr. Stewart testified

              25   that he had to cut rolls of roofing felt?




                                                                 66
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   I don't recall a specific numerical

               3   value.  I have in my notes that he cut rolls

               4   with a hand saw or circular saw.

               5        I think it was something that was certainly

               6   done more than several times, but I don't recall

               7   the specific number.

               8        Q.   Do you recall that he testified to

               9   doing it about a half a dozen times during his

              10   career?

              11        A.   I mean, I think the deposition will

              12   speak to itself.  I think it was something along

              13   those lines, yes.

              14        Q.   Do you recall him distinguishing

              15   between rolls of perforated felt manufactured by

              16   Bird and rolls of nonperforated felt

              17   manufactured by Bird?

              18        A.   I do recall that he differentiated

              19   them, yes.

              20        Q.   Do you have any understanding as to

              21   whether or not nonperforated residential roofing

              22   felt contains asbestos?

              23        A.   My understanding is that it did, but

              24   apart from the documents that I've been

              25   provided, it says that --




                                                                 67
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        I mean, this is only describing the

               3   perforated, but he didn't seem to differentiate

               4   between the two, other than the perforated

               5   versus the non.

               6        Q.   Have you read or reviewed, in

               7   preparation for this deposition or your opinion

               8   in this case, any interrogatory answers served

               9   by Bird?

              10        A.   I have not.  Everything that I was

              11   provided was marked.

              12        Q.   Okay.  If I represent to you that the

              13   15-pound nonperforated felt did not contain

              14   asbestos, will you accept that for purposes of

              15   the remainder of the deposition?

              16        A.   So I'm to assume that that is a true

              17   fact?  Is that what you're asking me to do?

              18        Q.   Yes.

              19        A.   Okay.

              20        Q.   So assume that the nonperforated felt

              21   did not contain asbestos, and Mr. Stewart

              22   testified to cutting felt on only six occasions,

              23   and he further testified that he would first try

              24   to use the nonperforated felt, would you agree

              25   with me that he potentially cut perforated felt




                                                                 68
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   on less than six occasions?

               3             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to the form of

               4        the question.  Mischaracterizes the

               5        testimony.

               6             I think you've already asked her

               7        that question.

               8        A.   I don't recall specifically whether he

               9   differentiated between what papers he cut, so I

              10   wouldn't be able to tell you how many times he

              11   cut perforated versus non.  I recall him talking

              12   about the perforated.

              13        Q.   Are you aware, one way or the other,

              14   whether some of Bird 15-pound perforated felt

              15   did not contain asbestos?

              16        A.   I am -- I have not been provided with

              17   information that states that it did not contain

              18   asbestos.

              19        Q.   Are you able to quantity, Dr. Moline,

              20   in any mathematical way, either fibers per CC

              21   for a specific exposure or fiber years of

              22   exposure, that Mr. Stewart may have had to Bird

              23   products?

              24        A.   I am, based on the information I had,

              25   I am not able to do that.




                                                                 69
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   And therefore, you cannot do it for

               3   Mrs. Stewart, either; am I correct?

               4        A.   I'm unable, that data being available,

               5   so I wouldn't be able to do it for Mr. or

               6   Mrs. Stewart.

               7        Q.   And therefore, there's no way for you

               8   to opine whether or not the cumulative lifetime

               9   exposure Mrs. Stewart may have had to Bird

              10   product was above or below her cumulative

              11   lifetime background exposures?

              12             MR. JOYCE:  Objection.

              13        Mischaracterizes testimony.

              14        A.   No.  One doesn't need to have an

              15   actual mathematical number in order to say that

              16   someone had a low level or any type of exposure.

              17   If they are manipulating asbestos product, just

              18   because someone didn't measure it at the time,

              19   doesn't mean that they didn't have an exposure.

              20        You're making a statement that if there's

              21   no mathematical number, then there's no way to

              22   say that there's an exposure.

              23        I'd like you to consider the fact that

              24   thousands of people have you been exposed to

              25   asbestos where there has been no quantified




                                                                 70
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   exposure and they've developed disease, so your

               3   assumption is flawed.

               4        Q.   I'm not arguing -- well, strike that.

               5        But you can't tell me whether the

               6   cumulative exposure, potential cumulative

               7   exposure, to Bird products, when added together,

               8   is more or less than the exposure Mrs. Stewart

               9   may have had from the ambient air?

              10             MR. JOYCE:  Objection to form.

              11        A.   Well, I can't give you an actual

              12   number.

              13        With respect to the fact that Mr. Stewart

              14   had this exposure from the Bird felt, and then

              15   he would bring the clothes home, and that would

              16   be a potential exposure that Mrs. Stewart would

              17   have.  That would be when she was manipulating

              18   his clothes above background is, is how I would

              19   describe it in this particular case or in any

              20   case of take-home since there's never an actual

              21   measurement.

              22        Q.   And that assumes that the product

              23   Mr. Stewart was cutting contained asbestos and

              24   that Mrs. Stewart then laundered those clothes

              25   that he was wearing during that potential




                                                                 71
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   exposure; correct?

               3        A.   Correct.

               4        Q.   Do you have an opinion, Doctor, to a

               5   reasonable degree of scientific and medical

               6   certainty, whether Mrs. Stewart's take-home

               7   exposures to Bird products were a substantial

               8   contributing cause of her disease?

               9        A.   Based on the information that I have

              10   that he was cutting asbestos-containing Bird

              11   products that would have contaminated his

              12   clothing, his body, his car, that Mrs. Stewart

              13   would have had exposure to, then I would say

              14   that he -- she had an exposure to Bird products

              15   that were sufficient to be a contributing

              16   factor.

              17        Q.   And that would be your opinion, even

              18   considering, based on his testimony, that it

              19   only happened, at most, on six occasions?

              20        A.   He was also manipulating the joist

              21   paper, which he described as the same as the

              22   felt paper, as well as other products, so it's

              23   based on all of the Bird products he described.

              24        Q.   But again, you'd only attribute

              25   potential exposures to work with products that




                                                                 72
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   contained asbestos; correct?

               3        A.   Correct.

               4        Q.   And you'd consider evidence that such

               5   product did not contain asbestos or were not

               6   manufactured by Bird in reaching your

               7   conclusion, correct?

               8             MR. JOYCE:  Objection too form.

               9        A.   I'm sorry.  I don't understand what

              10   you're asking me.

              11        You're asking me Bird-specific or not

              12   Bird-specific?

              13        Q.   If I represented to you that Bird did

              14   not make the joist tape, you would certainly

              15   consider that when making your, when forming

              16   your opinion as to potential exposures to Bird

              17   products; correct?

              18        A.   If Bird did not make the joist paper,

              19   then Bird would not -- I would not attribute

              20   Bird to the joist paper.

              21        Q.   With regard to Kaiser Gypsum,

              22   Dr. Moline, you reviewed the interrogatories

              23   answers that were provided by Attorney Joyce;

              24   correct?

              25        A.   Correct.




                                                                 73
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Q.   Did you review anything else specific

               3   to Kaiser Gypsum?

               4        A.   With respect to this case, no.

               5        Q.   And with respect to the interrogatory

               6   answers you were provided, what information did

               7   you rely upon in helping you form your opinion

               8   in this case?

               9        A.   That a variety of different Kaiser

              10   Gypsum products --

              11        Actually, it cemented my knowledge that

              12   Kaiser Gypsum joint compound, cement, and other

              13   products, contained asbestos since they gave the

              14   percentages of asbestos in the various products,

              15   of which I had been familiar in the past, but it

              16   provided additional information about the

              17   percentage of asbestos in the various products

              18   that Kaiser Gypsum manufactured.

              19        Some of them or many of them I was aware of

              20   before, but not specifically related to this

              21   Stewart case.

              22        Q.   And what was your -- what is your

              23   summary of Mr. Stewart's testimony regarding his

              24   work with or around Kaiser Gypsum products?

              25        A.   That they sold Kaiser Gypsum products,




                                                                 74
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   and sometimes the bags would break, and he would

               3   describe it as a cloud of dust.  He would have

               4   to clean up the spills.  Sometimes the bags

               5   would break and they would tape them over, if

               6   they could; that the bags, in general, were

               7   dusty.

               8        He noticed that when he was dealing with

               9   the dry joint compound it would, even in the

              10   closed bags, there would be dust when they were

              11   unloading the pallets onto the shelves.

              12        He described about 30 percent of the joint

              13   compound they sold was Kaiser Gypsum.

              14        Q.   Okay.  And 70 percent was manufactured

              15   by a different company; correct?

              16        A.   Correct.

              17        Q.   When he testified to putting the

              18   sealed bags of joint compound onto the shelves

              19   and recalled seeing a puff of dust, you're not

              20   aware of any study of the composition of that

              21   dust coming off those sealed bags, are you?

              22        A.   I have not seen a study that has

              23   looked specifically at sealed bag dust puffs.

              24        Q.   So that dust could have been coming

              25   from other sources other than the actual




                                                                 75
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   material in the bags; correct?

               3        A.   You're saying when someone is

               4   manipulating a bag that's full of dust and they

               5   are moving that dust, that I'm to assume that

               6   the dust comes from another place other than the

               7   bag that's dealing with products that are, some

               8   of which have a dimension that are smaller than

               9   the pores of a bag?

              10        You're asking me to assume that the dust

              11   could have come from other places, other than

              12   the manipulation of the bag?  Is that what

              13   you're asking me?

              14        Q.   I'm not asking you to assume.  I'm

              15   asking you if it's possible.

              16        A.   Could it be that there was a pile of

              17   dust that they stacked the bag on that they are

              18   disturbing?  Sure, but not probable.

              19        Q.   Or dust on the bag -- well, strike

              20   that.

              21        What was your recollection of how many

              22   times Mr. Stewart recalled having to clean up

              23   bags that ripped open?

              24        A.   I didn't put down the specific number

              25   of times that they ripped open in my notes.  I




                                                                 76
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   don't recall how many times he said they would

               3   rip open, but, I mean, it wasn't a one time

               4   occurrence.  I know that.

               5        Q.   Would you agree or disagree with me if

               6   I represented to you that he said it happened on

               7   about 25 to 30 occasions?

               8        A.   With respect to the bags just bursting

               9   open, I've --

              10        Q.   Correct.

              11        A.   I think that's probably about correct,

              12   in terms of the actual bags just bursting open,

              13   but that's not taking into account other

              14   exposures from the various bags that didn't

              15   burst open all the way.

              16        Q.   Understood.

              17        Would you, based on his description of only

              18   30 percent of the joint compound bags was Kaiser

              19   Gypsum, would you have reason to disagree with

              20   the assumption that, of the 25 or 30 times that

              21   the bags ripped open, only 30 percent of those

              22   occasions involved Kaiser Gypsum?

              23        A.   I mean, it could have been that Kaiser

              24   Gypsum made bad bag and those were always the

              25   ones that always ripped.




                                                                 77
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        I don't have any way of knowing what the

               3   exact percentages of Kaiser Gypsum bags ripped

               4   as opposed to another company.

               5        Q.   Fair enough.

               6             THE WITNESS:  I hate to do this, but

               7        I'm staying very hydrated, so I need to

               8        excuse myself for two minutes.

               9             MR. MARTIN:  I'm almost done.  If

              10        you can go two or three minutes --

              11             THE WITNESS:  I can wait.

              12             MR. MARTIN:  And then we can take a

              13        break, and the next person can go.

              14             MR. JOYCE:  Sounds wonderful.

              15        Q.   And again, you have not seen or --

              16   strike that.

              17        You have no way of assessing or quantifying

              18   the amount of potential exposure Mr. Stewart had

              19   to asbestos resulting from his handling of

              20   Kaiser Gypsum products?

              21        A.   You mean a numerical way?

              22        Q.   Correct.

              23        A.   No.  There was no actual measurements

              24   that were done of Mr. Stewart.  I mean, he would

              25   have to base it on the percentage of asbestos




                                                                 78
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   that was present in the various products and the

               3   number of times he manipulated any of the

               4   various Kaiser Gypsum products.

               5        But we don't have an enough information to

               6   give a mathematical number.

               7        Q.   And then the same follows for

               8   Mrs. Stewart, correct, that we don't have enough

               9   information to do a numerical calculation of her

              10   potential exposure?

              11        A.   Correct.

              12        Q.   And we've established it would be

              13   something less than Mr. Stewart's exposure,

              14   based on the take-home nature of her exposure?

              15        A.   In general, yes.

              16        Although, if he had super dusty clothes and

              17   she's shaking them out, then it could be very

              18   similar to what he was exposed to at the time,

              19   based on the literature showing that the

              20   exposures can actually be relatively similar to

              21   what the worker was exposed to when the

              22   laundering person is shaking out the clothes.

              23        Q.   Do you have an opinion in this case,

              24   Dr. Moline, with a reasonable degree of

              25   scientific and medical certainty, whether




                                                                 79
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   Mrs. Stewart's potential exposures to asbestos

               3   from Kaiser Gypsum products was a substantial

               4   cause of her mesothelioma?

               5        A.   Yes.  I think they were.

               6        Q.   And is that based on anything, other

               7   than your review of his testimony and your

               8   understanding of the composition of the Kaiser

               9   Gypsum products?

              10        A.   As well as the medical literature that

              11   talks about exposures from joint compound and

              12   take-home exposure, yes.

              13        I mean, it's based on Mr. Stewart's

              14   testimony, the percentages of asbestos confirmed

              15   in the Kaiser Gypsum documents, as well as the

              16   medical literature related to joint compound

              17   exposures and take-home exposures.

              18             MR. MARTIN:  Dr. Moline, I think

              19        that's all I have.  I appreciate your

              20        patience.  I don't think I've had the

              21        pleasure of taking your deposition or

              22        participating in one before, so thank you

              23        for your time.

              24             I'll review my notes, but after the

              25        break, I'll pass it on to anyone else who




                                                                 80
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        has questions.

               3             (Whereupon, a brief recess was

               4        taken.)

               5                     EXAMINATION

               6   BY JOHN EGAN, ESQ.:

               7        Q.   Doctor, this is John Egan.  I

               8   represent H.B. Fuller.  I've got some questions,

               9   a lot fewer than Mr. Martin, but I do have at

              10   least a few.

              11        I want to ask you some questions about your

              12   notes, which I think we earlier marked as

              13   Exhibit Number 2, and I think I'm looking at

              14   those same notes.

              15        This is four pages of handwritten notes on

              16   lined paper; is that right?

              17        A.   Yes.

              18        Q.   With the name Susan Stewart at the top

              19   of the first page?

              20        A.   Correct.

              21        Q.   If you --

              22        I take it these are notes that you

              23   transcribed based on your review of written

              24   materials that were provided to you by

              25   Mr. Joyce; is that right?




                                                                 81
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   I wrote these notes.  Transcription

               3   means something else to me.

               4        As I was reading the documents that were

               5   provided to me by Mr. Joyce, I took notes.

               6        Q.   Fair enough.

               7        If you would look down toward the bottom of

               8   the first page, the second handwritten line up

               9   from the bottom, as I read that, it says:

              10        Sold Fuller adhesives or rolled flooring.

              11        Did I read that correctly?

              12        A.   You did.

              13        Q.   And do you know where you, what you

              14   were reading or reviewing when you wrote that

              15   line?

              16        A.   It was some part of Mr. Stewart's

              17   deposition, where he described that.

              18        Q.   When you give an anything from this

              19   case, Stewart case, relating to H.B. Fuller,

              20   other than Mr. Stewart's deposition transcript?

              21        A.   And the document that we mark as the

              22   other exhibits?

              23        Q.   Correct.  Maybe my question wasn't

              24   clear enough.

              25        My understanding is some of those other




                                                                 82
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   exhibits were answers to interrogatories from

               3   other cases involving Bird and Kaiser Gypsum,

               4   your CV, et cetera, et cetera.

               5        But was there anything else that was

               6   specific to this case that was provided to you

               7   by Mr. Joyce, other than the deposition

               8   transcript from Mr. Stewart's deposition?

               9        A.   With respect to this case, I was

              10   provided with interrogatories that were from a

              11   different case that were from Fuller, but not

              12   with respect to this particular case, as well as

              13   testing of the thin-set materials that were done

              14   by MVA.  Again, these were done in association

              15   with other law firms, so they were not specific

              16   to this case.  They are specific to the various

              17   products.

              18        But that's all that was provided to me.

              19        Q.   Okay.  If you turn to the second

              20   page of your notes, the 9th handwritten line on

              21   that second page, again as I read it, it says:

              22        Fuller floor mastic, M-A-S-T-I-C, and then

              23   there's a parentheses with the words dry and

              24   pre-made in the parenthesis.

              25        Did I read that correctly?




                                                                 83
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   You did.

               3        Q.   Did you also -- strike the question.

               4        Did you also write that line after

               5   reviewing some portion of Mr. Stewart's

               6   deposition transcript?

               7        A.   I did.

               8        Q.   Continuing further on down that page,

               9   there are three lines written at the very

              10   bottom.  What I read is:

              11        When bags of JC --

              12        Is that your abbreviation for joint

              13   compound?

              14        A.   In this particular setting, yes.

              15        Q.   Okay.  When bags of JC or Fuller would

              16   break --

              17        Then there's a dash.

              18        -- some dust or cloud of dust --

              19        And then an arrow.

              20        -- work clothes worn home, cleaned up

              21   spilled dust with brush/dustpan.

              22        Did I read that correctly?

              23        A.   Correct.

              24        Q.   And was that information also derived

              25   from Mr. Stewart's deposition transcript?




                                                                 84
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   It was.

               3        Q.   Now, beginning on the next page which

               4   I guess is the third page of your notes, it

               5   looks to me, from my review of this, that the

               6   third page and the fourth page are exclusively,

               7   or at least almost exclusively, your notes of

               8   your review of Susan Stewart's medical records;

               9   is that fair to say?

              10        A.   Yes.

              11        Q.   There's nothing on the third and

              12   fourth pages of those notes that has to do with

              13   her exposure or John Stewart's exposure to an

              14   asbestos-containing product manufactured by

              15   either H.B. Fuller or any other defendant, for

              16   that matter; is that fair to say?

              17        A.   Yes.

              18        Q.   You also said that you reviewed a set

              19   of answers to interrogatories in the Mazzorana

              20   case, and we marked those as Exhibit 4?

              21        A.   Correct.

              22        Q.   Those were provided to you by

              23   Mr. Joyce as well?

              24        A.   Yes.

              25        Q.   Let me just relocate those.




                                                                 85
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        Those answers to interrogatories in the

               3   Mazzorana case were from a case in state court

               4   in New York; correct?

               5        A.   Yes.

               6        Q.   Do you have those in front of you?

               7        A.   I do.

               8        Q.   Did you know anything about the

               9   Mazzorana case before Mr. Joyce sent you this

              10   set of answers to interrogatories?

              11        A.   No.

              12        Q.   You weren't involved in that case in

              13   any fashion?

              14        A.   I don't believe so.

              15        Q.   The copy of those answers to

              16   interrogatories that I have seem to jump from

              17   what looks like page 1 to what looks like

              18   page 6.

              19        Is your, does your set have pages 2, 3, 4,

              20   or 5 in them?

              21        A.   No.

              22        Q.   So I take it you weren't provided with

              23   pages 2, 3, 4, 5?

              24        A.   That is correct.

              25        Q.   What did you learn of any significance




                                                                 86
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   from reviewing this set of answers, or at least

               3   partial set of answers to interrogatories, from

               4   the Mazzorana case?

               5        A.   That the thin-set products contained

               6   asbestos ranging from .6 percent to 8 percent.

               7        And which was what I had understood prior

               8   to reading this interrogatory, that these types

               9   of thin-set contained asbestos.  I hadn't

              10   actually seen the percentages.

              11        Q.   Okay.  What is your understanding, as

              12   you sit there this morning, as to what, as to

              13   whether either Susan Stewart or John Stewart

              14   were exposed to thin-set?

              15        A.   John Stewart would have been exposed

              16   from the bags of the thin-set, which he

              17   described as breaking on occasion.

              18        He handled them when they were being sold

              19   in the stores or when he was manipulating them

              20   with the, whether it was maneuvering them on a

              21   forklift or just removing them from pallets,

              22   noted that both the Fuller or just the bags of

              23   the various types of products would get hooked

              24   all the time and there would be some exposure or

              25   some of the product would eke out from them




                                                                 87
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   getting caught on the shelving that they were

               3   placed on during the course of manipulation of

               4   the bags.

               5        Q.   Okay.  Let me state the question a

               6   different way:

               7        Is the source of your knowledge or

               8   information with regard to Mr. Stewart's

               9   exposure to thin-set based on anything other

              10   than your review of his deposition transcript?

              11        A.   With respect to Mr. Stewart's

              12   exposure?  No.

              13        Q.   Okay.  I take it that applies to

              14   Mrs. Stewart as well?

              15        A.   Correct.

              16        Q.   Did you receive any information from

              17   any other source, written or oral, pertaining to

              18   Mr. Stewart or Mrs. Stewart's exposure to a

              19   product manufactured or sold by H.B. Fuller,

              20   other than the transcript from Mr. Stewart's

              21   deposition?

              22        A.   Only in the sense of Mr. Joyce said

              23   that one of the defendants in the case was

              24   Fuller.

              25        And it was from the sale of these products




                                                                 88
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   that was corroborated by Mr. Stewart's

               3   deposition.  That was the extent of it.

               4        Q.   Okay.  That's the extent of what

               5   Mr. Joyce told you?

               6        A.   Yes.

               7        Q.   With regards specifically to Fuller, I

               8   mean.

               9        A.   Right, right, that that was one of the

              10   defendants in the case, and that it --

              11        And then when I looked in the deposition, I

              12   saw that it was Fuller.  I don't recall that he

              13   mentioned it before I actually read the

              14   deposition.  I honestly did not know who was

              15   going to be asking me questions today until we

              16   talked very briefly yesterday and until you all

              17   got on the phone.

              18        Q.   Okay.  I have some notes here from

              19   your earlier testimony this morning, so it may

              20   be a paraphrase at best, but I think you said

              21   earlier that you were provided with materials, I

              22   took that to be written materials, regarding the

              23   percentage of asbestos in various defendants'

              24   products.

              25        Do you recall saying that earlier this




                                                                 89
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   morning?

               3        A.   Yes.  I was referring to the documents

               4   that we've been discussing.

               5        Q.   Okay.  Were those the --

               6        You described them as the MVA documents?

               7        A.   Yes and no.  I mean, the MVA actually

               8   did a measurement that measured the amount of

               9   asbestos as well as some air sampling.

              10        And I was also referring to the

              11   interrogatories that we just discussed with

              12   respect to Fuller and then the other companies'

              13   products.

              14        Q.   Okay.  The documents from MVA

              15   Associates were marked as --

              16        A.   Collectively as Exhibit 3.

              17        Q.   Exhibit 3; right?

              18        A.   Yes.

              19        Q.   And that's 50-some-odd pages of

              20   documents.

              21        Do you have those in front of you?

              22        A.   I have them in front of me.  I don't

              23   know how many pages there are.

              24        Q.   I'll represent to you that the copies

              25   that I have amount to 51 pages.




                                                                 90
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   Mine are double-sided, so its less.

               3        Q.   Prior to receiving them from Mr. Joyce

               4   in connection with your expected testimony in

               5   this case, had you ever seen those documents

               6   before?

               7        A.   I don't believe I've seen these

               8   specific documents before.

               9        But in all honesty, I might have in some

              10   other case.  They sort of go into a big rabbit

              11   hole of various documents and exposure

              12   measurements for various products that are at

              13   issue in various cases, and I can't recall

              14   seeing these specific ones before, but I might

              15   have.

              16        Q.   Okay.  Do you have any -- strike the

              17   question.

              18        I take it you were not involved to any

              19   extent in the analyses that were done by MVA

              20   Scientific Consultants that were documented in

              21   the reports that we have collectively marked as

              22   Exhibit 3?

              23        A.   That would be correct.

              24        Q.   And the answers to interrogatories in

              25   the Mazzorana case that we've marked as Exhibit




                                                                 91
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   Number 4, those were the documents that were

               3   provided to you by Mr. Joyce under his cover

               4   letter of August 13th; is that correct?

               5        A.   I believe so.  I don't remember -- I

               6   don't think -- actually, I think they might have

               7   come --

               8        I think the 13th I got the deposition and

               9   the medical records.  I might have received the

              10   other ones a couple days later.  I don't

              11   remember.

              12        Q.   I'm just looking at what I have.

              13   There are actually two letters dated August 13th

              14   from Mr. Joyce to you.  One of them says,

              15   confirms that your deposition is being taken on

              16   August 27th, which is today, and it encloses,

              17   specifically Mr. Stewart's deposition

              18   transcript, medical records from South Shore

              19   Hospital, and medical records from Compass

              20   Medical in Braintree.  There's that letter.

              21        And then there's a second letter, also

              22   dated August 13th, that says:

              23        Enclosed please find documents pertaining

              24   to the following defendants:  Bird,

              25   Incorporated; H.B. Fuller Company; and Kaiser




                                                                 92
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   Gypsum Company.

               3        And it also encloses a copy of your

               4   deposition notice.  I guess my question is:

               5        Are the documents that we've been talking

               6   about for the last few minutes, the answers to

               7   interrogatories from the Mazzorana case and

               8   the -- well, let's limit it to that, the answers

               9   to interrogatories in the Mazzorana case.

              10        Is that what was provided to you under

              11   cover of August 13th when Mr. Joyce sent that

              12   letter to you?

              13        A.   Yes.

              14        Q.   Just trying to make sure that there

              15   isn't some other documents or some other set of

              16   documents that you were provided with that we

              17   haven't identified this morning?

              18        A.   No.  This is the extent of the

              19   documents that I've been provided.

              20        Q.   Okay.  Now, you've testified a couple

              21   of times this morning that you were retained by

              22   Mr. Joyce approximately three weeks ago; is that

              23   right?

              24        A.   It was -- it might have even been -- I

              25   think it was around August 9th or 10th that we




                                                                 93
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2   had a conversation.

               3        Q.   Okay.  Were you aware that you were

               4   actually disclosed as an expert witness for the

               5   plaintiff in this case in a document that was

               6   filed in court in June of this year, June of

               7   2019?

               8        A.   I was not aware of that, but it

               9   doesn't surprise me.

              10        Q.   Why does it not surprise you?

              11        A.   I've worked with Mr. Joyce before, and

              12   sometimes the deadlines are that -- I believe we

              13   had a conversation in the spring that there were

              14   a number of cases coming up that I would be

              15   disclosed in, but I don't recall any specifics

              16   of the various cases, so if I had been disclosed

              17   in June, that wouldn't surprise me.

              18        Q.   After reviewing the information that

              19   you've been provided in connection with your

              20   testimony in this case, did you undertake any

              21   research or investigation yourself as to whether

              22   any of the products that were described by

              23   Mr. Stewart in his deposition as being

              24   manufactured or sold by H.B. Fuller, in fact,

              25   contained asbestos?




                                                                 94
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        A.   No.  I relied on the documents I was

               3   sent.

               4        Q.   Okay.

               5        A.   And my --

               6        Q.   I'm sorry?

               7        A.   I'm sorry.  I started speaking, and I

               8   didn't complete my phrase.

               9        I have looked at documents related to

              10   thin-set in the past, but not specifically

              11   related to the Stewart case.  I can't tell you

              12   went it was, but I know I have looked at them in

              13   the past.

              14        But with respect to the Stewart case, the

              15   documents that we've discussed today are the

              16   total related to this case.

              17        Q.   Okay.

              18        A.   I haven't done any specific research

              19   on H.B. Fuller since August 10th.

              20             MR. EGAN:  I think that's all I

              21        have, Doctor.  I'll pass you on to the

              22        next lawyer.  Thank you.

               5                     EXAMINATION

               6   BY MICHAEL JOYCE, ESQ.:

               7        Q.   Dr. Moline, good morning.  My name is

               8   Michael Joyce.

               9        Do you have an opinion, to a reasonable

              10   degree of medical certainty, whether or not the,

              11   Mrs. Stewart's exposure to the Fuller products

              12   discussed in Mr. Stewart's deposition were a

              13   substantial contributing factor to her

              14   mesothelioma?

              15        A.   Yes.  Her exposure to the products

              16   would have been a substantial factor.

              17        Q.   And I'll ask you the same question as

              18   to her exposure to Durabond products described

              19   in Mr. Stewart's deposition.

              20        Do you have a opinion, to a reasonable

              21   degree of medical certainty, whether that

              22   exposure was a significantly contributing factor

              23   to her mesothelioma?

              24        A.   Yes, it was.

              25             MR. JOYCE:  Okay.  I have no,




                                                                 96
               1                   Jacqueline Moline

               2        nothing further.

               3             MR. MARTIN:  I think we're done.

               4             MR. EGAN:  Let me ask one quick

               5        question.  This is John Egan, again.

               6                     EXAMINATION

               7   BY JOHN EGAN, ESQ.:

               8        Q.   Doctor, I take it that your opinion

               9   with regard to causation and H.B. Fuller, the

              10   one that you expressed just a moment ago, is

              11   based on your understanding that the H.B. Fuller

              12   products that Mr. Stewart identified in his

              13   deposition did, in fact, contain asbestos;

              14   correct?

              15        A.   That's correct.

              16             MR. EGAN:  Thank you.

              17             MR. MARTIN:  Thank you, Doctor.  I

              18        think we're done.

              19             Off the record.

              22             THE REPORTER:  Mr. Joyce, you are

              23        ordering a copy of the transcript?

              24             MR. JOYCE:  Yes.

                                                                 97

               2        ordering a copy of the transcript?

               3             MR. EGAN:  Yes, please.

               4             THE REPORTER:  Ms. Balluku, are you

               5        ordering a copy of the transcript?

               6             MS. BALLUKU:  Yes, we are.

               7             THE REPORTER:  Thank you very much.

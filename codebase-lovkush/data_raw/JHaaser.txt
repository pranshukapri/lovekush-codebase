               2  conversation with him last?

               3          A.   About 10 minutes.

               4          Q.   And what was it in the first

               5  paragraph that precipitated the telephone

               6  conversation?

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form,

               8  leading.

               9          A.   So he had called me, because he

              10  had received a call from Donna Babbitts, who

              11  is the CV leads RN at the time for CT surgery.

              12  And she had contacted him to see if he had

              13  received the page that morning.  He was on

              14  call, and had not responded.  And so Adam had

              15  called to let me know what had happened.

              16          Q.   Okay.  How would Mr. Carruthers

              17  have been held accountable, if he had not

              18  reported that issue?

              19          A.   So he felt that --

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              21          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Go ahead.

              22          A.   He felt that Dr. Holland had been

              23  acting strange lately, and wanted to let me

              24  know what happened, because he did not want to

              25  have any type of formal write-up or discipline



                                                               10


               1  in his file for not returning a page.

               2          Q.   And how did the conversation in

               3  the next paragraph segue into a discussion of

               4  Dr. Holland?

               5          A.   So Adam, just kind of in the

               6  natural flow of the conversation, had just

               7  stated that Dr. Holland had been acting

               8  strange, and wanted to make me aware of some

               9  things.

              10          Q.   Were you asking him questions, or

              11  did he volunteer issues?

              12          A.   No.  He volunteered them.

              13          Q.   Did you take any notes of your

              14  conversation with him?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   And did you have them?

              17          A.   Yes.  I used them to -- to type

              18  this up.  I don't have them anymore.

              19          Q.   Okay.  What did you do with them?

              20          A.   I shred them.

              21          Q.   And why did you do that?

              22          A.   After I typed it up and saved it

              23  to my personal drive, I shred them.

              24          Q.   Do you always shred your notes?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               11


               1          Q.   Let's take a look at the first

               2  bullet.  What exactly did Mr. Carruthers say

               3  about a potential lawsuit?

               4          A.   He stated that Dr. Holland had

               5  been making comments that if he was ever

               6  fired, he would sue Mercy, and take Dr. Hashmi

               7  and everybody else down with him.

               8          Q.   Did -- did Mr. Carruthers say

               9  what basis Dr. Holland intended to sue Mercy?

              10          A.   No.

              11          Q.   Did he ever say that Dr. Holland

              12  alleged his lawsuit would be based on

              13  discrimination, based on race or national

              14  origin?

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              16          A.   No.

              17          Q.   Let's take a look at the second

              18  bullet.  Did Mr. Carruthers give you any idea

              19  of the types of comments Dr. Holland was

              20  making about foreign physicians and Muslims?

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  Just object to the

              22  form.

              23          A.   He just was -- said that he had

              24  made some inappropriate comments in the

              25  hallway, and wanted to make sure that he was



                                                               12


               1  not associated with those comments.

               2          Q.   Did he give you any idea of what

               3  those comments were?

               4          A.   No.  I just took them to be

               5  negative, because he didn't want to be

               6  associated with them.

               7          Q.   Okay.  Let's take a look at the

               8  third bullet.  What did Mr. Carruthers say

               9  about what Dr. Holland said about referrals?

              10          A.   He stated that Dr. Holland made

              11  the comment that he felt Dr. Hashmi was

              12  stealing cases from him.

              13          Q.   What else did he say about that?

              14          A.   Well, Adam stated that he felt

              15  that the reason Dr. Holland's surgical volume

              16  was low, was because the cardiologists and

              17  referring primary care doctors were not happy

              18  with the care that their patients were

              19  receiving from Dr. Holland.

              20          Q.   Did he tell you why?

              21          A.   He stated that the cardiologists

              22  were upset, when the PCPs had called them,

              23  because Dr. Holland would rarely see them

              24  postoperatively, and he felt -- they felt that

              25  the burden of the care for follow-up after



                                                               13


               1  surgery was placed back on them.

               2          Q.   Did he ever say that the

               3  referrals were being redirected based on his

               4  race or national origin?

               5          A.   No.

               6             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               7          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Did he say

               8  anything else, Mr. Carruthers say anything

               9  else about the PCPs' concern that led them to

              10  refer to Dr. Hashmi, instead of Dr. Holland?

              11          A.   Just that the patients were also

              12  dissatisfied, sometimes because they expressed

              13  they wanted to see their surgeon

              14  postoperatively, so the expectation, when they

              15  saw the PA, was let down.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Let's take a look at the

              17  fourth bullet.  What did Mr. Carruthers say

              18  about that issue?

              19             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              20          A.   He stated that a lot of

              21  Dr. Holland's cases were moved or rescheduled

              22  per Dr. Holland's request.

              23          Q.   And what was the issue that he

              24  was expressing?

              25          A.   That he did not feel that those



                                                               14


               1  -- that they were moved because of urgent

               2  reasons, and that Dr. Holland just moved them

               3  if he had some, something to do, he would make

               4  comments like, he's at home, or he wanted to

               5  go out on his boat today, so he moved that

               6  patient's surgery.

               7          Q.   Did he give you examples?

               8          A.   Yeah.  A couple at the time, and

               9  Adam's main concern was that there could be a

              10  delay in care for that patient.

              11          Q.   And what kind of examples of

              12  personal issues, though, did he give you?

              13          A.   He stated things such as he would

              14  be at home, he was working on his lawn, or

              15  that he was out on his boat.

              16          Q.   Did Mr. Carruthers express any

              17  feelings about this issue?

              18          A.   He was frustrated.  It was

              19  inconvenient for him, because they would have

              20  to switch around the whole schedule, and he

              21  felt that he could be supporting other

              22  surgeons, or we could have other surgeries at

              23  that time.

              24          Q.   Okay.  Let's go to the fifth

              25  bullet.  Does the abbreviation PO mean



                                                               15


               1  postoperative?

               2          A.   Yes.

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What did

               5  Mr. Carruthers say about Dr. Holland's

               6  postoperative practices?

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               8          A.   He stated that Dr. Holland did

               9  not see very many of his postoperative

              10  patients, and that caused disagreements

              11  between him and the PAs.

              12             MR. ARCHINACO:  Just, I want to

              13  note on the record, just I want to make a

              14  notation, it's unclear whether or not this

              15  witness is reading from the document, or

              16  whether she's testifying from memory, but you

              17  can continue.

              18          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Go ahead.  Are

              19  you testifying from your memory?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Okay.  The document is in front

              22  of you, though, correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   And I'm referring to the document

              25  to get you oriented, correct?



                                                               16


               1          A.   Correct.

               2          Q.   Okay.  So why don't we go over

               3  that again.

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               5          A.   I'm sorry.

               6          Q.   So what did Mr. Carruthers say

               7  about Dr. Holland's postoperative practices?

               8          A.   That he would not see his

               9  patients postoperatively, and this caused

              10  disagreements between him and the PAs.

              11          Q.   Did he give you some examples or

              12  --

              13          A.   Yes.  He would say that

              14  Dr. Holland --

              15             (Whereupon, at 1:10, Dr. Holland

              16  entered the deposition.)

              17          A.   -- wouldn't see the patient, the

              18  PAs would see the patient.  They would come up

              19  with a plan of care, and then Dr. Holland

              20  would come back later, disagreeing with the

              21  plan of care that the PAs had come up with.

              22             It was frustrating for them,

              23  because Dr. Holland wasn't there, and so he

              24  didn't see that patient at that time.

              25          Q.   Any other examples that you can



                                                               17


               1  think of?

               2          A.   No.

               3          Q.   Okay.  Did Mr. Carruthers ever

               4  say he agreed with how Dr. Holland was

               5  handling postoperative care?

               6          A.   No.  He expressed --

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               8          A.   Sorry.  No, he expressed

               9  frustration with that.

              10          Q.   Now, based on your own personal

              11  observations, did Dr. Holland's postoperative

              12  procedures reflect the same procedures used by

              13  other surgeons that you observed at

              14  Mercy-St. Vincent?

              15             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              16          A.   No.  They were different.  The

              17  other surgeons saw their patients

              18  postoperatively, sometimes in collaboration

              19  with the PAs, where Dr. Holland, the PAs

              20  solely were the ones seeing the patients.

              21          Q.   Let's take a look at the sixth

              22  bullet.  Just review that for a second.

              23          A.   (Doing as indicated.)

              24          Q.   What did Mr. Carruthers say about

              25  Dr. Holland's manipulating postoperative



                                                               18


               1  patients to prevent them from being readmitted

               2  because of complications?

               3          A.   So Adam stated --

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               5          A.   Adam stated that Dr. Holland

               6  would give out his cellphone number, that way

               7  the patients would call him before they would

               8  go to the emergency room.  He felt that that

               9  would prevent them from being readmitted, so

              10  that Dr. Holland didn't have to get called

              11  back into the hospital.

              12          Q.   Did he say anything else?

              13          A.   No.  That was pretty much it.

              14  And then if they -- he was -- he felt that

              15  some of them ended up with a plural effusion.

              16          Q.   Yeah.  What did he say about

              17  plural effusion?

              18          A.   So, he just stated that he felt

              19  that some of the patients may not have been

              20  treated appropriately, and they had the plural

              21  effusion, and then Dr. Holland would tell them

              22  to walk more.

              23          Q.   Okay.  What is plural effusion?

              24          A.   I don't -- sorry, I didn't really

              25  know.  I did look it up.  And I -- from what I



                                                               19


               1  found, it's fluid around the lung.

               2          Q.   Okay.

               3             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               4  Move to strike.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) What did

               6  Mr. Carruthers say about Dr. Holland getting

               7  irritated on the phone with patients?

               8          A.   So he would say that --

               9             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              10          A.   -- when the patients would call

              11  Dr. Holland postoperatively, that he would get

              12  frustrated with them, sometimes he would be

              13  short with them on the phone, and just had an

              14  overall frustrated tone.

              15          Q.   Did he say that happened often?

              16          A.   I would say as frequently as they

              17  would call.

              18          Q.   Let's take a look at the seventh

              19  bullet.  Read that for a second.

              20          A.   Uh-huh.

              21          Q.   Did Mr. Carruthers actually use

              22  the phrase "hostile work environment"?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   And how did he describe this

              25  alleged --



                                                               20


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

               2  of the question.

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) -- hostile work

               4  environment?

               5          A.   He stated that Dr. Holland would

               6  often have emotional outbursts, he would yell

               7  at the physicians' assistants; he felt that if

               8  something went wrong, he would place blame on

               9  them, and that the physicians' assistants

              10  would have to defend their actions.

              11          Q.   And how regular did that occur?

              12          A.   I would say pretty frequently,

              13  from the conversation that Adam and I had had.

              14          Q.   And did he actually use the word

              15  malicious?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   And what did he mean by

              18  malicious, do you know?

              19          A.   I think he was, from what I can

              20  understand, he -- he was stating that he felt

              21  attacked, and that he would have work that he

              22  felt that Dr. Holland should be doing dumped

              23  on him.  And that if anything went wrong with

              24  that, that he would receive the blame there.

              25          Q.   Did you ever take him up on his



                                                               21


               1  offer to sit down and discuss his concerns?

               2          A.   Nothing further than this

               3  conversation.

               4          Q.   Did you ever tell him you were

               5  going to escalate this up to your boss?

               6          A.   Yes, I did.

               7          Q.   And what was his reaction?

               8          A.   He was supportive of that.

               9          Q.   What did you do with this

              10  information, other than send an email to

              11  Jayne Beckstead?

              12          A.   Nothing.

              13          Q.   Was that part of your job to do

              14  anything else, once you sent the email to

              15  Ms. Beckstead?

              16          A.   No, not in my role at that time.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Based on this conversation

              18  you had on April 24th, 2015, did you think

              19  Mr. Carruthers was being truthful about

              20  Dr. Holland?

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   Do you think his concerns were

              23  legitimate?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.



                                                               22


               1          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Do you have any

               2  reason to believe that anything he told you,

               3  that he put on this paper, was exaggerated or

               4  incorrect?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   Did you accurately record

               7  everything Mr. Carruthers said to you in this

               8  email?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   Was this the only time

              11  Mr. Carruthers complained about Dr. Holland to

              12  you?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   What were the nature of his other

              15  complaints?

              16          A.   So he -- Adam would call me quite

              17  often about various things.  When he did call

              18  me about Dr. Holland, it was mostly the same

              19  types of issues, he wasn't available, or he

              20  was here late, because Dr. Holland wouldn't

              21  come in, things such as that.

              22          Q.   Did you ever escalate those

              23  concerns to your supervisor?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Did any other person complain



                                                               23


               1  about Dr. Holland to you?

               2          A.   I did get some complaints from

               3  the clinical staff in the office at times.

               4          Q.   And who was that?

               5          A.   That would have been like the

               6  front desk person, or the office manager.  And

               7  they would just complain that they were

               8  getting complaints from patients, because they

               9  were having to explain why it was they weren't

              10  seeing Dr. Holland, and they were seeing the

              11  PA.

              12          Q.   Did they complain about anything

              13  else?

              14          A.   Not that I can recall.

              15             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit B

              16  was marked for identification.)

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) I'm handing you

              18  what's been marked as Haaser B.  It's an email

              19  dated May 6, 2015 from you to Jayne Beckstead.

              20  Have you seen this --

              21          A.   Yes.

              22          Q.   -- document before?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   And are you the author?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               24


               1          Q.   And what precipitated this email?

               2          A.   So Paul and Adam had contacted

               3  me.  They were frustrated again with

               4  Dr. Holland not being in clinic that day.

               5          Q.   And what else happened that you

               6  recorded here?

               7          A.   Yeah.  So Dr. Holland would

               8  normally have his clinic on Wednesdays, which

               9  would have both consults and postop patients.

              10  And if he didn't have any consults that day,

              11  he would not come in and let the PAs see their

              12  postop patients.  And so then he would, if he

              13  did have consults, and he wanted to come in on

              14  a different day, he would switch that over to

              15  another day, which caused the PAs to be in

              16  clinic more than necessary, in their opinion,

              17  and so they were just frustrated, because they

              18  could be rounding, and so that made them stay

              19  later in the day when that happened.

              20          Q.   And how often did they tell you

              21  this happened?

              22          A.   So it happened quite frequently,

              23  and I sent this to Jayne, because it started

              24  to become an issue.

              25          Q.   And who is Paul mentioned in this



                                                               25


               1  email?

               2          A.   So Paul is Paul Brown.  He was a

               3  CT surgery PA at the time.

               4          Q.   Okay.  Did he have the same

               5  concerns as expressed by Mr. Carruthers?

               6          A.   Yes.

               7             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               8          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) So was

               9  Dr. Holland seeing patients for consults and

              10  postoperative care?

              11             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              12  Calls for speculation.

              13          A.   He was seeing --

              14          Q.   Based on your observations and

              15  what has been told to you, was Dr. Holland

              16  seeing the patients for consults and

              17  postoperative care?

              18             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form

              19  again.

              20          A.   He was seeing the patients for

              21  consults, but not for the postoperative care.

              22          Q.   Okay.  And did they tell you with

              23  what frequency that was occurring?

              24          A.   No.  They brought it up to me a

              25  couple of times, and then at the end, I think



                                                               26


               1  he was rarely seeing any postop patients.

               2          Q.   Okay.  Was there anything done

               3  about this issue, besides sending an email?

               4          A.   Not that I'm aware of.

               5          Q.   In the second from last paragraph

               6  here, what was described to you regarding

               7  disagreements with patient care management?

               8          A.   So again, this was with the

               9  postop management, where Dr. Holland wouldn't

              10  see the postop patients.  The PAs would see

              11  and evaluate the patient, come up with a plan

              12  of care, and then later Dr. Holland would be

              13  upset, because he did not agree with that plan

              14  of care.  So they were frustrated by that.

              15             I think the example I used there

              16  was testing, where they may have ordered a

              17  test, and he didn't think they needed a test.

              18  Then they felt then the next time when they

              19  didn't order a test, he would want a test, so

              20  there was some disagreements going on there.

              21          Q.   Were the examples in this email,

              22  in Haaser B, examples that were actually

              23  experienced by Paul and Adam?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               1             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit C

               2  was marked for identification.)

               3          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) I'm handing you

               4  what's been marked as Exhibit C, deposition

               5  Exhibit C, Haaser C.  It's an 11-14-14 email

               6  from you to Elizabeth Sheroian, regarding

               7  Promise training.  Are you the author of this

               8  email?

               9          A.   Yes.

              10          Q.   And who is Elizabeth Sheroian?

              11          A.   She was the office manager for CT

              12  surgery at the time.

              13          Q.   What is the purpose of the email?

              14          A.   So I was just letting her know

              15  about the Promise training that the -- the

              16  docs had to attend, and she was sending me

              17  back that they were frustrated with having to

              18  do that, and then clarifying whether or not

              19  Dr. Holland had to attend that or not.

              20          Q.   So what exactly is Promise

              21  training?

              22          A.   It was a two-hour mandatory

              23  training that all employees had to attend, and

              24  it talked about our patient experience, and

              25  Mercy's mission, and -- and how do we improve



                                                               28


               1  that and work together.

               2          Q.   Was Dr. Holland required to go to

               3  Promise training?

               4          A.   No.

               5             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               6          Q.   And why not?

               7          A.   He was not an employee of Mercy.

               8             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               9  Also, move to strike the last answer.

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  You can move to

              15             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit D

              16  was marked for identification.)

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you

              18  what's been marked as Deposition Exhibit

              19  Haaser D.  It's an 11-21-14 email to you, to

              20  yourself, and Elizabeth Sheroian from -- from

              21  you.  And are you the author of the instant

              22  message that is indicated on this page?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   Directing your attention to the

              25  third line discussion.  What was the issue



                                                               29


               1  with Dr. Hashmi's frustration here?

               2          A.   So Elizabeth was sharing with me

               3  that Dr. Hashmi was fearful about the

               4  reputation of the practice declining, due to

               5  the -- due to the complaints from the patients

               6  and from the nursing staff.

               7          Q.   And who were the complaints

               8  about?

               9          A.   About Dr. Holland.

              10          Q.   And what were the complaints

              11  entailing?

              12          A.   Again, the patient complaints

              13  about not being able to see him

              14  postoperatively, and then the nurses were

              15  complaining about his behavior in the

              16  hospital.  They didn't like working with him.

              17          Q.   What kind of behaviors did they

              18  complain about?

              19          A.   Again, just his demeanor --

              20             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              21          A.   -- his emotional outbursts with

              22  the staff.

              23             (Whereupon, Defendant's Exhibit E

              24  was marked for identification.)

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Wiencek) Handing you



                                                               30


               1  what's been marked as Deposition Haaser E,

               2  Exhibit E.  It's an August 25th, 2015 email to

               3  you from Elizabeth Sheroian.  Have you seen

               4  this email before?

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   And once again, who is

               7  Ms. Sheroian?

               8          A.   She's the office manager for CT

               9  surgery at the time.

              10          Q.   And why did she send this to you?

              11          A.   I was her direct supervisor at

              12  the time.

              13          Q.   And what was the issue here with

              14  Dr. Holland's absence in Indiana, when he was

              15  on call?

              16          A.   So Elizabeth was letting me know

              17  that Dr. Holland had gone out of town, but was

              18  still on call for the service line, and so he

              19  had to contact Dr. Phillips to have him cover

              20  for him, when a consult came in.

              21          Q.   And what was the problem as a

              22  result of that?

              23          A.   Well, Dr. Phillips was in

              24  surgery, so he did end up taking call.

              25  Dr. Hashmi, it appears, was not in town, based

               1  on this.

               2          Q.   Was this an issue?  Was this the

               3  first time this issue had occurred?

               4             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

               5          A.   It was the only time that I'm

               6  aware of.

               7          Q.   Okay.  In your position, when you

               8  were working there in that position with

               9  Dr. Holland, had you ever seen or heard

              10  anything at Mercy-St. Vincent that would lead

              11  you to believe that referrals from

              12  cardiologists were being made on a surgeon's

              13  race or national origin?

              14             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              15          A.   No.

              16          Q.   Have you seen or heard anything

              17  that would lead you to believe that anyone

              18  from Mercy-St. Vincent was directing,

              19  redirecting referrals based on a surgeon's

              20  race or national origin?

              21          A.   No.

              22          Q.   Is there any reason why you

              23  cannot provide truthful testimony about the

              24  facts of your personal interactions and

              25  conversations with Mr. Carruthers?



                                                               32


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Or with -- or about Dr. Holland?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Okay.  I have no further

               5  questions.

               6                     EXAMINATION

              17          A.   I would say the summer of 2016.

              18          Q.   2016?

              19          A.   I think so.  Uh-huh.

              20          Q.   And he's an attorney for Mercy;

              21  is that correct?

              22          A.   No, he's not an attorney for

              23  Mercy.

              19  he went to a law firm after that, so trying to

              20  remember what year.  Maybe --

               5  position until November of 2016, correct?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   And then what position did you

               8  take after that?

               9          A.   Director of operations, the

              10  position I have now.

              11          Q.   And that's -- by the way, when

              12  you were with the CT, overseeing CT surgery --

              13          A.   Uh-huh.

              14          Q.   -- from April of 2014 through

              15  November of 2016 --

              16          A.   Uh-huh.

              17          Q.   -- at that time, were you

              18  employed by Mercy Health Physicians?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   Okay.  And who was your

              21  supervisor?

              22          A.   Jayne Beckstead.

              23          Q.   And who did Ms. Beckstead report

              24  to?

              25          A.   I believe at the time she



                                                               38


               1  reported to Michele Montague.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And who did Ms. Montague

               3  report to?

               4          A.   She reported to, I believe it was

               5  Dr. Andrabi at the time.

               6          Q.   So just in terms of chain of

               7  command, in terms of if -- if a direction came

               8  down from Dr. Andrabi, typically the way it

               9  would happen is not directly to you, but if

              10  such a thing ever occurred, it would come

              11  through the chain of command?

              12          A.   Correct.

              13          Q.   All right.  Now, just in mind

              14  with the dates, November of 2016 is when you

              15  were in the CT surgery position, until -- do

              16  you believe that Mr. Strauss was still

              17  employed with Mercy through that time period?

              18          A.   I don't think so.

              19          Q.   Do you recall him -- his

              20  employment ending around the time that you

              21  began dating him?

              22          A.   It was around the time, I think.

              23  I'm trying to remember.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  Please don't guess.

              25          A.   I'm sorry, yeah.



                                                               39


               1          Q.   Was there a controversy that

               2  arose because of you dating Mr. Strauss?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Was -- did the reason he leave

               5  have anything to do with the two of you

               6  dating?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   So he then went to a law firm; is

               9  that correct?

              10          A.   Correct.

              11          Q.   And so you believe he still does

              12  Mercy work as of today?

              13          A.   No, he does not do Mercy work

              14  now.  Now he's at ProMedica.

              15          Q.   Oh, he's with ProMedica now?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Okay.  Now, in terms of

              18  Dr. Hashmi, did anyone ever advise you

              19  anything with regard to his surgical outcomes

              20  in terms of statistically where he stacked up?

              21          A.   No.

              22          Q.   That's not the type of

              23  information you would be reviewing, correct?

              24          A.   Not typically, no.

              25          Q.   Okay.  And you didn't review



                                                               40


               1  statistical information for Dr. Holland

               2  either, correct?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   Now, in terms of Mr. Carruthers,

               5  when was the first time you recall

               6  Mr. Carruthers, if at all, telling you that he

               7  wanted to work full-time with Dr. Holland?

               8          A.   I don't recall him saying he

               9  wanted to work full-time --

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              11  foundation.

              12          A.   -- with Dr. Holland.

              13          Q.   Did Mr. -- what -- what did you

              14  -- in terms of your observation of the

              15  relationship between Mr. Carruthers and Mr. --

              16  and Dr. Holland, do you think they had a

              17  positive relationship, or do you think that it

              18  was overall not positive?

              19          A.   I would say overall not positive,

              20  based on him complaining about him frequently.

              21          Q.   Okay.  And so you believe that

              22  Mr. Carruthers really did not want to work

              23  with Dr. Holland, correct?  That's your

              24  testimony today?

              25          A.   Yes.  That was what he expressed



                                                               41


               1  to me.

               2          Q.   This has been -- this is

               3  deposition exhibits, and so there may be tabs

               4  here.  And then if I direct you to a tab, the

               5  exhibit will be right behind it.  Okay?

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   I wanted to direct you first to

               8  Exhibit 98.

               9          A.   Okay.

              10          Q.   Now, did you know a person named

              11  Robyn Stein?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   And -- but you know who

              14  Mr. Bertke was?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   And obviously you know who

              17  Mr. Carruthers was, correct?

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   And you're not carbon copied on

              20  this email, but to put this in time

              21  perspective, this is from June 19, 2014 from

              22  Robyn Stein to Adam, and --

              23  adam@healthcareadvisorynetwork and also to

              24  Brad Bertke.

              25             Do you see that?



                                                               42


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   In the first sentence, it says,

               3  Adam Carruthers dropped by to talk with me

               4  after interviewing for a PA position here in

               5  the ED.  We may have an interesting

               6  opportunity with him, since he may be

               7  interested in working with Dr. Holland here at

               8  STA full-time, without any backup for a while.

               9             Did I read that correctly, that

              10  portion?

              11          A.   Yeah.

              12          Q.   And so at least from this email,

              13  it looks like Mr. Holland is talking, or like

              14  Mr. Carruthers, as being reported, is talking

              15  about potentially working with Dr. Holland

              16  full-time, correct?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, lack of

              18  foundation.  She has no knowledge of this

              19  email.

              20          A.   Yeah.

              21          Q.   Well, you were in a supervisory

              22  position.  No one told you that this is what

              23  Adam wanted, to work with Dr. Holland

              24  full-time?

              25          A.   No, they did not.



                                                               43


               1          Q.   And according to you, your

               2  testimony, you thought that doctor --

               3  Mr. Carruthers didn't want to work with

               4  Dr. Holland at all, because he didn't like

               5  him, right?

               6          A.   Yes, based on what he told me.

               7          Q.   Do you know they're personal

               8  friends?  Did you know that they were personal

               9  friends?

              10             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              11          A.   No, I didn't.

              12          Q.   Now, the next thing I wanted to

              13  direct you to is Exhibit 64, which might be in

              14  the first binder.  And if it is, I'll --

              15          A.   It looks like it's in the other

              16  one.

              17          Q.   Yeah.  I'll get that for you.

              18  You can put it to the side.  We might use some

              19  others in there, but --

              20          A.   Okay.  Thanks.  Sorry, what

              21  number was it again?

              22          Q.   Exhibit 64.

              23          A.   Is it in front of the page or

              24  behind the page?  Sorry.

              25          Q.   After the tab.



                                                               44


               1          A.   After the tab, okay.

               2          Q.   And it's two pages.  There is an

               3  email that goes up to -- on January 22nd,

               4  2015.  Goes to Michele Montague.

               5          A.   Uh-huh.

               6          Q.   Or from Michele Montague to

               7  Fayyaz Hashmi.  And then there is an email

               8  below with regard to Dr. Hashmi.

               9          A.   Uh-huh.

              10          Q.   And then below is an email from

              11  you to -- to Elizabeth Sheroian providing RVUs

              12  for the last quarter of 2014, it appears.

              13  Well, it looks like the numbers are more than

              14  that, but the RE is RVUs for the last quarter

              15  of 2014, so ....

              16          A.   Uh-huh.

              17          Q.   You generally see this exhibit.

              18  If you want to take a quick scan of it.  I see

              19  you're on the bottom email.  I wanted to ask

              20  you some additional questions, so please, if

              21  you want to review it for a second, and then

              22  I'll ask you some questions about it.

              23          A.   Okay.

              24             MR. WIENCEK:  I'll object to the

              25  questions about this exhibit, because it's



                                                               45


               1  outside the scope of my examination.

               2          A.   Okay.  I'm good, I think.

               3          Q.   Ms. Haaser, at the bottom, on the

               4  second page, there is statistical data that

               5  you appear to have -- well, W -- strike that.

               6             On the second page, there appears

               7  to be RVU information that you have forwarded

               8  to Ms. Sheroian.

               9             Do you see that?

              10          A.   Uh-huh.

              11          Q.   Just keep it audible, I'm sorry.

              12          A.   Yes, sorry.

              13          Q.   Okay.  Now, then there is a

              14  series of emails after this about -- from

              15  Dr. Hashmi.  After you forwarded the

              16  information, do you have any recollection, as

              17  you sit here today, about whether you would

              18  have been involved in any process going

              19  forward at that point about RVUs and

              20  Dr. Hashmi?

              21          A.   No, I would not have been

              22  involved.

              23          Q.   Did you -- would you -- would

              24  this email above, where he's talking about his

              25  contract and RVUs, is that anything you would



                                                               46


               1  have had any saying in, or authority in, or

               2  would have overseen anything having to do with

               3  Dr. Hashmi and RVUs?

               4          A.   No.  That's all handled by our

               5  finance team.

               6          Q.   So after you would have forwarded

               7  this information on, it's not like you would

               8  have gotten another email back from someone

               9  saying, oh, by the way, this is what

              10  Dr. Hashmi said, correct?

              11          A.   No, correct.

              12          Q.   You were just asked to get some

              13  information, you forwarded it along, and then

              14  they do whatever they do with it --

              15          A.   Correct.

              16          Q.   -- correct?  Okay.  Fair enough.

              17             All right.  Now, you were asked

              18  questions about what is Haaser Exhibit A,

              19  which has been marked by the Defendants.  This

              20  is Bates stamped MSV 004147 and 4148.

              21          A.   Uh-huh.

              22          Q.   I have some questions for you as

              23  well.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   Now, first, the context in which



                                                               47


               1  this -- well, let me go back.

               2             Is -- so as of April of 2015, at

               3  least according to the last paragraph,

               4  Mr. Carruthers is reporting to you that he is

               5  being -- he's in a hostile work environment;

               6  is that correct?

               7          A.   Correct.

               8          Q.   And then you forward this to

               9  Ms. -- to Ms. Beckstead; is that right?

              10          A.   Yes.

              11          Q.   And what was your expectation as

              12  to who then would receive this, if anybody?

              13          A.   It would be my understanding that

              14  it would go up to hospital leadership that

              15  would have had the relationship with the

              16  Toledo Clinic.

              17          Q.   When you say hospital leadership

              18  that had the relationship with the Toledo

              19  Clinic, who do you mean by that?

              20          A.   At the time, I think Greg might

              21  have been, may have had that relationship with

              22  Toledo Clinic.  I'm not sure.

              23          Q.   Mr. Hood, Greg Hood?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Who is present?



                                                               48


               1          A.   Correct.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And -- and in the first

               3  bullet point, you wrote that Dr. Holland has

               4  been making -- well, first of all, let's go

               5  back a second.

               6             How did you decide what you

               7  actually wrote down in the memo, that

               8  Mr. Carruthers reported to you, and what you

               9  left out of the memo?

              10          A.   So I just typed up whatever he

              11  told me.

              12          Q.   So -- okay.  So the memo would be

              13  your most accurate account of what the

              14  conversation was with Mr. Carruthers?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   Now, let's start with the first

              17  bullet point for a second.

              18          A.   Okay.

              19          Q.   Dr. Holland has been making

              20  comments stating that he is keeping

              21  documentation on Mercy, so that when he gets

              22  fired, he can file a lawsuit against Mercy.

              23             Did I read that part correctly?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   Now, what do you recall, if



                                                               49


               1  anything else, about what type of

               2  documentation Dr. Holland was keeping on

               3  Mercy?

               4          A.   Adam didn't really share anything

               5  further.

               6          Q.   And what -- what was your

               7  understanding as to why you were being

               8  informed that Dr. Holland was keeping

               9  documentation on Mercy about a potential

              10  lawsuit?

              11          A.   Well, Adam -- I was his direct

              12  supervisor, so I believe that Adam was

              13  escalating it to, up the chain of command, his

              14  concerns.

              15          Q.   But you don't know what the

              16  lawsuit was going to be about, correct?

              17          A.   Correct.

              18          Q.   Now, the next part says, so that

              19  when he gets fired, he can file a lawsuit

              20  against Mercy.

              21          A.   Uh-huh.

              22          Q.   I want to talk about the fired

              23  for a second.  What was your understanding as

              24  about whether or not Mercy could fire Mr. --

              25  Dr. Holland?



                                                               50


               1          A.   So my understanding is that

               2  Toledo Clinic employed Dr. Holland, and that

               3  Mercy had a professional services agreement

               4  with Toledo Clinic to contract for his

               5  services.

               6          Q.   And where did your understanding

               7  come from that Dr. Holland was an employee?

               8          A.   He's not an employee.

               9          Q.   Not an employee.  Where did that

              10  come from, that understanding?

              11          A.   From the contract, from the

              12  agreement.

              13          Q.   You read his agreement?

              14          A.   Yes, I had access to the

              15  agreements, uh-huh.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Well, you also had access

              17  to Mr. Strauss, who had been involved with

              18  marketing issues pertaining to Dr. Holland as

              19  well, correct?

              20             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              21  foundation, lack of foundation.

              22          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Let me go

              23  back.  Let me restate it.

              24             I'll assert to you that

              25  Karl Strauss was copied on a variety of emails



                                                               51


               1  that have been withheld under a claim of

               2  privilege, having to do with marketing and --

               3  of Dr. Holland at the time he was hired.

               4             Did you also have access to

               5  Mr. Strauss to discuss whether or not

               6  Mr. Holland -- Dr. Holland was an employee?

               7          A.   No, I don't think I discussed

               8  that with him, because he was not an employee,

               9  based on the agreement.  So in my role, I have

              10  access to contracts for our employed

              11  physicians.  He was not -- Dr. Holland was not

              12  employed, based on the language in the

              13  contract.

              14          Q.   And -- and -- and in terms of him

              15  not being an employee, how many other

              16  physicians, surgeons, had you ever seen, where

              17  there was a service agreement that paid

              18  100 percent of the salary of the surgeon

              19  flow-through?

              20          A.   So from the agreement, from what

              21  I can recall, when we have a professional

              22  service agreement with other entities for

              23  provider services, it's not spelled out what

              24  that entity that they're employed by is paying

              25  them, just what we're paying to the entity for



                                                               52


               1  those services.

               2          Q.   Well, were you ever made aware

               3  that 100 percent of Dr. Holland's salary was

               4  paid first from Mercy to the, through its

               5  service agreement to Toledo Clinic, and then

               6  from Toledo Clinic to Dr. Holland?

               7          A.   No.

               8             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

               9  foundation, and a mischaracterization of the

              10  record.

              11          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) When was the

              12  last time you ever saw Dr. Holland's contract?

              13          A.   It would have been sometime

              14  during the time I had oversight for that

              15  department.

              16          Q.   So you're testifying from your

              17  memory of what his contract said as of -- as

              18  late as November 2016?

              19          A.   Correct.

              20          Q.   Now, in terms of the next

              21  sentence in your memo, he has also stated that

              22  if he is fired, that he isn't going down alone

              23  and is going to take Dr. Hashmi and everyone

              24  else down with him.

              25             Did I read that correctly?



                                                               53


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   And what was your understanding

               3  as to what Dr. Holland was documenting that

               4  was going to enable him to bring down

               5  Dr. Hashmi and everyone else?

               6          A.   So again, I'm just, was writing

               7  down exactly what Adam was telling me.  He

               8  didn't offer up additional information, that I

               9  recall.

              10          Q.   He didn't say anything about all

              11  the deaths that were occurring in the hospital

              12  --

              13             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              14  foundation.

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- because of

              16  Dr. Hashmi's surgeries?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              18  foundation, mischaracterization of the record.

              19          A.   No.

              20          Q.   He didn't mention anything about

              21  a number of minimally invasive procedures,

              22  where people had died, and they should not

              23  have?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   He didn't get into the details



                                                               54


               1  with you, correct?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

               3  foundation, mischaracterization of the record.

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Next bullet point.  He has also

               6  made inappropriate comments about foreign

               7  physicians and Muslims.

               8             Correct?

               9          A.   Correct.

              10          Q.   And then you didn't write

              11  anything else there?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   But today you said that Adam told

              14  you, even -- strike that.

              15             Although it's not written in this

              16  memo, you said today that Adam told you he did

              17  not want to be associated with the comments?

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   But that's not written in your

              20  memo?

              21          A.   No, but he stated that.

              22          Q.   Okay.  Well, how do you remember

              23  that independently, when you said earlier that

              24  you only remembered what was written in the

              25  memo?



                                                               55


               1          A.   I don't think I said I only

               2  remembered what was written in the memo.  Just

               3  that I documented from my notes what is on

               4  here.

               5          Q.   Okay.  Well, you said you were

               6  taking notes and writing things down as Adam

               7  said them contemporaneously, correct?

               8          A.   I don't really know what

               9  contemporaneously means.

              10          Q.   As he was saying things, you were

              11  writing things in your notes?

              12          A.   I was -- yes, I was handwriting

              13  them out, yes.

              14          Q.   And why is it that you -- I mean,

              15  why is it -- strike that.

              16             Who did you tell about the threat

              17  of litigation from Dr. Holland?

              18          A.   So I just forwarded this on to

              19  Jayne.

              20          Q.   You have no idea if anyone else

              21  in the organization was advised that

              22  Dr. Holland was documenting things so he could

              23  take the organization or Dr. Hashmi down with

              24  him?

              25          A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.



                                                               56


               1          Q.   Did that seem like something out

               2  of the ordinary to hear that a physician would

               3  be doing that?

               4          A.   Yes, that's why I sent it on.

               5          Q.   Did you follow up at any point

               6  after forwarding this to Ms. Beckstead, at any

               7  point in time, to find out what, if anything,

               8  was being done?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   Did you receive a litigation hold

              11  notice from anybody at the company advising

              12  you to retain your documents?

              13          A.   After I sent this?

              14          Q.   Yes.

              15          A.   No.  Just for this, I did receive

              16  a thing, probably, I don't know, two months

              17  ago or something.

              18          Q.   Okay.  But what I'm talking at

              19  the time, you indicate here yourself that,

              20  right here, that Dr. Holland has been talking

              21  about to -- to Adam about filing a lawsuit

              22  against Mercy, correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   Yet, the fact is he might file a

              25  lawsuit, and you're saying that you still



                                                               57


               1  followed your standard procedure of destroying

               2  your notes, even though someone might be

               3  filing a lawsuit?

               4          A.   Well, I type them up and save

               5  them, so I didn't see the need to save them.

               6          Q.   So there was -- the words were

               7  exactly translated from --

               8          A.   Uh-huh.

               9          Q.   -- handwritten --

              10          A.   Correct.

              11          Q.   -- to typed?

              12          A.   Uh-huh.

              13          Q.   All right.  So in the second

              14  bullet, he's also made inappropriate comments

              15  about foreign physicians and Muslims.

              16             Do you see that?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Now, what details were provided

              19  to you?

              20          A.   So Adam stated that he was making

              21  inappropriate comments, just like I wrote, and

              22  then he said, I'm letting you know all of

              23  this, because I don't want to be associated

              24  with any of it.

              25          Q.   Okay.  But why is it that you



                                                               58


               1  didn't write that down, that part down?  Why

               2  is it you only wrote down part of what he told

               3  you?

               4          A.   Well, I guess because if I would

               5  have wrote down everything he told me, it

               6  would have been huge.

               7          Q.   So you made a choice as to what

               8  was going into this memo?

               9          A.   No.

              10          Q.   You said if you had written down

              11  everything he had told you, it would be huge,

              12  so that means you took things out?

              13          A.   I guess --

              14          Q.   Right?

              15          A.   Yes.

              16          Q.   The next sentence, right after

              17  that, now, you have it in a different bullet

              18  point.

              19          A.   Uh-huh.

              20          Q.   But the next bullet point is, he

              21  has made statements that Dr. Hashmi is

              22  stealing cases from him.

              23          A.   Uh-huh.

              24          Q.   Correct?

              25          A.   Correct.



                                                               59


               1          Q.   Now, you didn't gain the

               2  understanding from Mr. Carruthers that he was

               3  telling you that Dr. Holland was relaying that

               4  he was not getting referrals because of

               5  foreign physicians and/or Muslims, and that

               6  Dr. Hashmi was stealing the cases with him,

               7  you didn't read those two together, even

               8  though they occurred right after one another?

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

              10  foundation, lack of foundation.

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   You didn't -- you didn't, from

              13  what Adam was saying to you, in one sentence

              14  Dr. Holland's talking about foreign physicians

              15  and Muslims, and then the next sentence he's

              16  talking about cases being stolen by

              17  Dr. Hashmi.  And you didn't put two and two

              18  together that those were related in --

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              20          Q.   -- (By Mr. Archinaco) -- what

              21  Dr. Holland was saying?

              22          A.   No.

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  Mischaracterizes the

              24  record --

              25          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) So you didn't



                                                               60


               1  --

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form and

               3  foundation.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- you didn't

               5  -- you didn't realize from your conversation

               6  with Mr. Carruthers, just to be clear, you

               7  didn't realize from anything Mr. Carruthers

               8  said that what he -- what was being reported

               9  by Dr. Holland was that there was a skewed

              10  referral pattern that did not seem to equate

              11  with quality, but had to do with the fact of

              12  who was a Pakistani, and who was being

              13  referred cases, because they were Pakistani --

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              15          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- or words to

              16  that effect?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form, foundation,

              18  misrepresentation of the record,

              19  argumentative.

              20             THE WITNESS:  Can I answer?

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  Sure.

              22          A.   So no, what I took from this

              23  conversation was that Adam did not want to be

              24  associated with Dr. Holland, because he was

              25  making inappropriate comments in general, and



                                                               61


               1  he wanted to distance himself from that, so

               2  that he did not get in trouble.

               3          Q.   Well, that's what you wrote down,

               4  correct?

               5          A.   What do you mean?

               6          Q.   It's what you wrote down in your

               7  memo, but you left certain things out.

               8          A.   To the best of my ability, I

               9  wrote down what Adam told me that day.

              10          Q.   Did you ever write down anywhere

              11  that it was being reported to you that

              12  Dr. Holland complained that Elizabeth Sheroian

              13  was not properly committing, or not properly

              14  supporting the practice?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              16  foundation.

              17          A.   Not that I remember.

              18          Q.   Was that reported to you by

              19  people?

              20          A.   Not that I remember.

              21          Q.   Were you ever informed that

              22  Dr. Holland had had a sit-down meeting with

              23  Thomas Arquilla, in or about January of 2014,

              24  in which discussions about referrals and/or

              25  quality were -- had occurred?



                                                               62


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Did you ever have any discussions

               3  with Mr. Arquilla about Dr. Holland?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   Did you ever have any discussions

               6  with Mr. Andrabi, Dr. Andrabi about

               7  Dr. Holland?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   Did you ever have any discussions

              10  with Doctor -- with Mr. Arquilla at all?

              11          A.   Not one on one.

              12          Q.   How about with Dr. Andrabi, any

              13  one-on-one discussions with him?

              14          A.   When I interviewed for my

              15  director position, he did interview me.

              16          Q.   Okay.  Other than that?

              17          A.   No.

              18          Q.   Do you recall ever being

              19  informed, by any source, that Dr. Hashmi was

              20  complaining to anyone about his contract,

              21  because now that Dr. Holland was present, he

              22  was getting less RVUs, and his contract had

              23  been set up, or incentivized based on RVUs?

              24          A.   Not that I recall.

              25          Q.   Did you have discussions with



                                                               63


               1  Elizabeth Sheroian, in or about February of

               2  2015, in which she told you that Mercy was

               3  going to be getting rid of, or trying to

               4  replace Dr. Holland?

               5          A.   Okay.  Sorry, say that one again.

               6          Q.   Did you have any discussions with

               7  Ms. Sheroian, in or about February of 2015,

               8  where she informed you that Mercy was either

               9  trying to get rid of Dr. Holland or trying to

              10  replace him?

              11          A.   No.

              12          Q.   Did you ever have --

              13          A.   Not that I remember.

              14          Q.   Did you ever have any discussion

              15  with anybody about people trying to terminate

              16  Dr. Holland, get rid of him, or replace him?

              17          A.   No.

              18             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection to form and

              19  foundation.

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Did you do

              21  anything to look into whether or not

              22  Dr. Hashmi was stealing cases from

              23  Dr. Holland?

              24          A.   No.

              25          Q.   You were in a position of



                                                               64


               1  overseeing the CT surgery group, though,

               2  correct?

               3          A.   Correct.  We had a -- there was a

               4  process in place, so it was nothing to look

               5  into.

               6          Q.   What do you mean there was a proc

               7  -- you mean that the office had a process in

               8  place for referrals?

               9          A.   So if a -- whoever would be on

              10  call would be the person that would be called,

              11  unless a referring physician specifically

              12  requested a particular surgeon.

              13          Q.   Uh-huh.  Right.  Okay.  That's

              14  the process that was supposed to be followed,

              15  correct?

              16          A.   Uh-huh.

              17          Q.   Yes?

              18          A.   Yes.

              19          Q.   Were you ever aware that

              20  Dr. Burdine had sent around a memo about

              21  referrals?

              22          A.   No.

              23          Q.   Did you ever hear that Dr.

              24  Burdine had ever made any complaints about

              25  referrals?



                                                               65


               1          A.   No.

               2          Q.   Now, in terms of the referrals,

               3  the way it's supposed to work, did you ever

               4  actually do anything to look into whether or

               5  not Dr. Hashmi had found a way to manipulate

               6  the process, and in fact was stealing cases?

               7          A.   No.

               8          Q.   It was reported to you by

               9  Mr. Carruthers, so you were sending to

              10  Ms. Beckstead, so if anything should be looked

              11  at, she should do it, is that what you're

              12  saying?

              13          A.   No.  I was just reporting what

              14  Adam had told me, was that -- that Dr. Holland

              15  had told him.

              16          Q.   Right.

              17          A.   Right.  So no, I didn't do

              18  anything further.

              19          Q.   Is there any reason that

              20  Dr. Holland's complaints or concerns wouldn't

              21  be looked into, that you can think of?

              22          A.   No.  I mean, the -- the process

              23  was being followed, so as far as --

              24          Q.   What process?

              25          A.   The process that I just spoke



                                                               66


               1  about.

               2          Q.   In terms of you sending it on to

               3  a superior?

               4          A.   No.  In terms of the way that the

               5  call schedule worked and the --

               6          Q.   How do you know that?

               7          A.   -- patients were sent.

               8          Q.   You didn't look into it?

               9          A.   Well, I mean, I know what is

              10  happening in the office as far as what my

              11  staff are doing.

              12          Q.   Okay.  So you knew then, for

              13  example -- you said earlier that Dr. Holland

              14  would -- was the only doctor, I think, that

              15  would not see patients postop; is that right?

              16          A.   Regularly, that was my

              17  observation, yes.

              18          Q.   So tell me then how many times

              19  did you notice that Dr. Hashmi had booked a

              20  surgery, and then on his schedule, had five or

              21  six appointments with patients right after the

              22  surgery, but he was unable to see them,

              23  because he was actually in the surgery?  How

              24  many times are you aware that happened?

              25             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,



                                                               67


               1  foundation, mischaracterization of the record.

               2          A.   I was not aware that that was

               3  happening.  It was not something that was

               4  brought to me.

               5          Q.   Were you there day to day to see

               6  it?

               7          A.   In my role, I was sometimes there

               8  day to day, but I had several offices I was

               9  over.

              10          Q.   Okay.  So if records, or

              11  scheduling records show that Dr. Hashmi would

              12  schedule a surgery, and then he would be in

              13  the surgery, but he would have all the patient

              14  consults, but he wouldn't really see those

              15  people, that would be surprising to learn

              16  that?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Because no one told you about

              19  that?

              20          A.   Nobody told me about that.

              21          Q.   Ms. Sheroian certainly didn't

              22  tell you, correct?

              23          A.   No, not that I was aware of.

              24          Q.   Ms. Sheroian seemed to like

              25  Dr. Hashmi a lot, didn't she?



                                                               68


               1             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               2  speculation.

               3          A.   Am I supposed to answer?  I think

               4  they had a good relationship, uh-huh.

               5          Q.   But she did not like Dr. Holland,

               6  correct?

               7          A.   I did not get the feeling that

               8  they got along as well.

               9          Q.   Now, the other obligations

              10  outside of work bullet point, you don't

              11  mention anything in here about a boat, but

              12  today you talked about a boat.

              13          A.   Yes.

              14          Q.   Why didn't you write boat down,

              15  when -- when you had the chance back in 2015,

              16  but you talked about boat today?

              17          A.   I don't know.  I'm summarizing.

              18          Q.   It doesn't say anything about a

              19  boat here.

              20          A.   No, but Adam called me frequently

              21  about that.

              22          Q.   But -- and so you knew, as of

              23  April 24, 2015, that this was -- what you were

              24  documenting was something that you should

              25  continue to document, if there were ongoing



                                                               69


               1  problems, right?

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection,

               3  speculation.

               4          A.   Yes.  Any -- anything that was

               5  significant that anybody comes to tell me, I

               6  document that conversation.

               7          Q.   So where are any notes, or memos,

               8  or emails of any other conversations you ever

               9  had with Adam, where he complained about

              10  anything to you?

              11          A.   I think we have the one email,

              12  where Paul and him complained, that I typed up

              13  and sent over.

              14          Q.   Okay.  Other than what you have

              15  looked at today --

              16          A.   Yeah.

              17          Q.   -- so far, anything else you can

              18  think of, of all these calls that Adam had

              19  with you, that you wrote anything down?

              20          A.   No.

              21          Q.   You had quite a few calls where

              22  he complained about Dr. Holland, but you never

              23  wrote anything down?

              24          A.   Adam complains about a lot of

              25  things.  He would call a lot, so ....



                                                               70


               1          Q.   He never complained about

               2  Dr. Hashmi, though, right, definitely not?

               3          A.   No, he would complain about

               4  Dr. Hashmi.

               5          Q.   Did he talk about the deaths?

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   Nobody seemed to -- nobody talked

               8  to you about --

               9             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection.

              10          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) -- that they

              11  thought there was a problem with patients

              12  dying in the hospital that shouldn't be dying?

              13          A.   No.

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  Form and foundation,

              15  mischaracterization of the record,

              16  argumentative.

              17          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, do you

              18  know if there was a difference in the office

              19  between scheduling patients for routine

              20  postops, in terms of seeing the surgeons, as

              21  opposed to postops where there were

              22  complications noted, and the surgeon should

              23  see the patient?  Were you aware of any

              24  procedures like that in the --

              25          A.   No.



                                                               71


               1          Q.   -- office?

               2          A.   Eh-heh.

               3          Q.   No?

               4          A.   No.

               5          Q.   And have you ever looked into

               6  what the typical procedure is of a heart

               7  surgeon, in terms of whether he sees routine

               8  postop patients, as opposed to ones that

               9  potentially have complications?

              10          A.   No.  I can only comment on what I

              11  saw in this practice.

              12          Q.   Well, you didn't actually see

              13  necessarily Dr. Hashmi doing what he was

              14  doing.  You just were told what he was doing?

              15          A.   No.  So I -- so Adam and the

              16  staff would tell me that the patients were

              17  complaining, because they wouldn't see

              18  Dr. Holland.  Adam communicated to me that he

              19  felt that the volume was dropping, and that

              20  the referrals weren't going to Dr. Holland,

              21  because of the postoperative process.  It was

              22  different between the surgeons.

              23          Q.   Okay.  Where does it say that in

              24  the memo, because I don't see that you wrote

              25  that here?



                                                               72


               1          A.   Which part?  Adam stated that he

               2  has seen Doctor --

               3          Q.   What you just said.

               4          A.   -- Holland's volume drop, because

               5  the cardiologists are specifically referring

               6  to Dr. Hashmi?

               7          Q.   Okay.  And it ends there.

               8          A.   And the cardiologists are getting

               9  feedback from referring PCPs that all of the

              10  postop follow-up from surgery that Dr. Holland

              11  performs is being pushed back to them, and

              12  they're not happy about it?

              13          Q.   Okay.  So?

              14             MR. WIENCEK:  So she answered,

              15  that's what she did.

              16          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) She added

              17  things.  It's okay.  You can keep adding

              18  things.  It just doesn't make sense, but --

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  She did not add

              20  anything.

              21             MR. ARCHINACO:  She did.

              22             MR. WIENCEK:  It's written there --

              23  it's written there right in black and white.

              24             MR. ARCHINACO:  Probably --

              25             THE REPORTER:  Wait guys.



                                                               73


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  That's all right.

               2  I'm going to move on to questions.  I'm not

               3  going to be argumentative with Mr. Wiencek.

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Well, that's a first.

               5          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Now, when you

               6  said that the patients were complaining --

               7          A.   Uh-huh.

               8          Q.   -- can you show me where it says

               9  that here?

              10          A.   No.  This -- this was comments

              11  that were made about, from the clinical staff,

              12  that the patients were complaining when they

              13  would come to check in.  And then when they

              14  would check out, they were expecting to see

              15  Dr. Holland, and then they did not.

              16          Q.   Yeah.  I'm just -- I'm looking

              17  where in your memo it says the patients were

              18  complaining.  Anywhere you can show me that?

              19          A.   No, I did not put it on here.

              20          Q.   Now, you indicated --

              21             MR. WIENCEK:  Mischaracterization

              22  -- hold on.  Mischaracterization of the

              23  testimony.  That was in a different exhibit.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You looked up

              25  that you --



                                                               74


               1             MR. ARCHINACO:  Move to strike.

               2             MR. WIENCEK:  Move to strike his

               3  move to strike.

               4          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You indicated

               5  that you looked up the word plural effusion.

               6  When did you look that up?

               7          A.   Upon reviewing this exhibit.

               8          Q.   Last week?

               9          A.   Uh-huh.

              10          Q.   Yes?

              11          A.   Yes.

              12          Q.   So before last week, you didn't

              13  know what a plural effusion was?

              14          A.   Correct.

              15          Q.   And when you did your research,

              16  did you do it on the internet?

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   Did you look into frequencies of

              19  plural effusions, and whether it's a standard

              20  complication following surgery, anything like

              21  that?

              22          A.   No.  I just simply read the

              23  definition.

              24          Q.   Do you know whether or not plural

              25  effusions are helped or assisted when a person



                                                               75


               1  walks more?

               2          A.   No, I do not.

               3          Q.   Now, do you know whether or not

               4  Dr. Holland gives out his cellphone, as a

               5  routine, had given out his cellphone number to

               6  patients almost his entire career?

               7          A.   I did not know that, but --

               8          Q.   And is that -- typically, for

               9  you, is that what you ever heard of, that a

              10  surgeon, CT surgeon, gives out his cellphone

              11  to patients and their families?

              12          A.   I don't know specifically to CT

              13  surgeons.  I know some physicians do and some

              14  do not.

              15          Q.   Well, do you know whether or not

              16  Dr. Hashmi gave out his cellphone to patients?

              17          A.   I don't know.

              18          Q.   Do you know whether or not

              19  Dr. Phillips did?

              20          A.   I do not know that either.

              21          Q.   Now, in terms of creating a

              22  hostile work environment and unnecessarily

              23  malicious in his actions, do you see that next

              24  paragraph?

              25          A.   Yes.



                                                               76


               1          Q.   Okay.  You don't have any other

               2  details, is that right --

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   -- here set out?

               5             Now, how many hours a week was Adam

               6  working at this time, in or about April of

               7  2015?

               8          A.   I do not know exactly how many

               9  hours he was working.

              10          Q.   Ms. Haaser, who was it that

              11  scheduled the hours for Mr. Carruthers?

              12          A.   So he's an exempt employee, so

              13  there is not a set schedule in this type of a

              14  service line.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Well, you say exempt

              16  employee, based upon his categorization, as

              17  you understood it, under federal or state laws

              18  having to do with overtime; is that right?

              19          A.   Yes, as he was set up in our HR

              20  system.

              21          Q.   And how was he set up, as a

              22  managerial?  What was he set up as that you

              23  understood him to be exempt?

              24          A.   He was a contracted employee.

              25          Q.   Uh-huh.



                                                               77


               1          A.   So he had an agreement that had a

               2  minimum requirement of hours.

               3          Q.   And do you recall what his

               4  minimum hours were in his contract?

               5          A.   I believe it was 40 hours

               6  minimum.

               7          Q.   And do you know how many hours

               8  routinely on a weekly basis Adam Carruthers

               9  was working in or about April of 2015?

              10          A.   I do not know exactly.

              11          Q.   Did Mr. Carruthers routinely

              12  complain to you that he was working in excess

              13  of 60-hour workweeks?

              14          A.   Yes, he did complain of that.

              15          Q.   And -- and the reason why he

              16  didn't get paid overtime is because of the

              17  exempt employee status, correct?

              18          A.   Correct.

              19          Q.   So he had one contract, which

              20  specified minimum hours.  And then if he was

              21  asked to do more hours, he was still paid the

              22  same; is that right?

              23          A.   Well, he had additional

              24  compensation in his contract for call.

              25          Q.   Okay.  But other than that?



                                                               78


               1          A.   I have to look exactly at it, but

               2  I don't recall any additional compensation.

               3          Q.   Did Mr. Carruthers complain to

               4  you about that it was -- that this, all of

               5  this 60-hour plus workweeks at Mercy was

               6  having an emotional and physical toll on him?

               7          A.   He did state that, yes.

               8          Q.   And -- and why is it that you

               9  didn't document that anywhere in this memo?

              10          A.   I don't believe he talked to me

              11  about it at that time.

              12          Q.   Do you recall documenting that

              13  anywhere in writing, that he was complaining

              14  about the physical and emotional toll being

              15  taken on him from working these 60-hour plus

              16  workweeks routinely?

              17          A.   I do not remember documenting it,

              18  but I do remember talking about it.

              19          Q.   But you understood that as of the

              20  time you wrote the document, the Carruthers

              21  memo, that Mr. Carruthers himself may be

              22  indicating he might be wanting to file a

              23  lawsuit, is that right, because of the hostile

              24  work environment?

              25          A.   No.  He did not indicate filing a



                                                               79


               1  lawsuit.

               2          Q.   But he told you it was a hostile

               3  work environment?

               4          A.   He did say that he felt

               5  Dr. Holland was creating a hostile work

               6  environment.

               7          Q.   So you didn't think that he might

               8  want to file his own lawsuit at that time?

               9          A.   He did not indicate that to me,

              10  no.

              11          Q.   And did you get the impression

              12  that he was complaining in any way that he

              13  believed that it was Dr. Holland that was

              14  causing him to work in excess of 60 hours a

              15  week, and that it was his fault?

              16          A.   He did state at times that he

              17  would go in for Dr. Holland specifically, yes.

              18          Q.   Okay.  But he also indicated he

              19  covered a lot of other -- he covered other

              20  surgeons as well, didn't he?

              21          A.   Yes, he did.  However,

              22  Dr. Holland specifically would request Adam

              23  at times, so ....

              24          Q.   Coming back to Exhibit Haaser --

              25  give me one second, please.  Just give me a



                                                               80


               1  second here.

               2             Do you -- it's 2 o'clock.  What

               3  time did we start?  Would you like to take a

               4  -- why don't we take a five-minute break now,

               5  because I'm going to get my papers assorted.

               6          A.   Okay.

               7          Q.   Just take a quick break.

               8  Restrooms are right up here, if you need any

               9  water or anything.

              10          A.   All right.  Thanks.

              11             (Whereupon, a break was taken from

              12  2:09 until 2:23.)

              13          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) You had been

              14  shown Exhibit Haaser D, which is text

              15  exchanges with yourself and Ms. Sheroian.

              16             Do you recall how frequently you

              17  had text messages with Ms. Sheroian?

              18          A.   I believe this was an IM on the

              19  computer.

              20          Q.   Oh, I'm sorry.

              21          A.   Okay.

              22          Q.   Instant messenger through the

              23  computer?

              24          A.   I mean, I don't recall.  It's a

              25  method of communication I use with a lot of



                                                               81


               1  people.

               2          Q.   Did you use it frequently with

               3  Ms. Sheroian?

               4          A.   I don't know how you would

               5  categorize frequently.

               6          Q.   How often?

               7          A.   She would reach out.  I don't

               8  know.

               9          Q.   How --

              10          A.   Maybe -- I would be guessing.

              11          Q.   Do you have a best estimate?

              12          A.   Couple of times a month maybe.

              13          Q.   Okay.  So if there were other

              14  comments about Dr. Holland in communications

              15  to you -- strike that.

              16             This was on -- you didn't go about

              17  pulling documents yourself, or did you?

              18          A.   No.

              19          Q.   IT people, or whomever.  You

              20  weren't involved in the process of pulling

              21  responsive documents in this case, correct?

              22          A.   Correct.

              23          Q.   Okay.  There is Exhibit B, May 6,

              24  2015.

              25          A.   Uh-huh.



                                                               82


               1          Q.   And there is a reference to a --

               2  a gentleman named -- you were asked about

               3  Paul.

               4          A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.

               5          Q.   What was Paul's full name?

               6          A.   Paul Brown.

               7          Q.   And does he still work at Mercy?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   Why did he stop working there?

              10          A.   I believe his employment was

              11  terminated.

              12          Q.   Why was it terminated?

              13          A.   I'd have to look exactly why it

              14  was terminated, but I believe it had to do

              15  with his medical, or his license being not

              16  active.

              17          Q.   Did it have to do with narcotics?

              18          A.   I believe that came up in the

              19  discussion.

              20          Q.   Maybe some type of narcotics

              21  issue?

              22          A.   I'm sorry?

              23          Q.   That he had some type of

              24  narcotics issue?

              25          A.   That he had some kind of process



                                                               83


               1  he was obligated to follow with his license,

               2  due to a previous issue, uh-huh.

               3          Q.   Exhibit E, there was just some

               4  issues.  There was some questions asked of you

               5  about Dr. Phillips covering for Dr. Holland.

               6          A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.

               7          Q.   Keep it audible.  Okay.

               8             Did you ever have a chance to

               9  observe Dr. Holland and Dr. Phillips' working

              10  relationship?

              11          A.   Not really.

              12          Q.   Do you know whether or not they

              13  were friendly with each other?

              14          A.   Not really.

              15          Q.   Do you recall any complaints

              16  being voiced to you that Dr. Hashmi would

              17  schedule Dr. Holland for call, when he knew

              18  Dr. Holland was going to go on vacation?

              19             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection --

              20          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) Had you ever

              21  heard that?

              22          A.   No.

              23             MR. WIENCEK:  -- form, foundation.

              24          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) So if that was

              25  occurring, no one made you aware of that,



                                                               84


               1  correct?

               2          A.   Correct.

               3          Q.   Now, in terms of scheduling OR

               4  time, would you have, in your role as a

               5  supervisor of CT surgery, would you have been

               6  aware of, or aware of the OR time that was

               7  being scheduled by surgeons?

               8          A.   So just to clarify, I was a

               9  regional manager at the time, so no, I did not

              10  have any involvement in getting that set up.

              11          Q.   Did you have, or were you ever

              12  made aware, that Dr. Hashmi would have

              13  procedures that would go so long, that they

              14  would have to shift out the nurses, one shift

              15  of nurses would leave, and another shift would

              16  come in?

              17             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              18  foundation, mischaracterization of the record.

              19          A.   No, I don't believe I had any

              20  direct knowledge of that.

              21          Q.   Did you have any indirect

              22  knowledge of that?

              23          A.   Not that I recall.

              24          Q.   So if that was occurring, or did

              25  occur, that's not that -- you were not made



                                                               85


               1  aware?

               2          A.   It's more of an inpatient --

               3          Q.   Okay.

               4          A.   -- situation.

               5          Q.   I previously asked you some

               6  questions about Dr. Hashmi scheduling a

               7  surgery, and then clinics, clinical days.  I

               8  wanted to give you a little bit more detail.

               9             Were you ever made aware that

              10  Dr. Hashmi routinely would schedule surgery

              11  for 8:30 a.m., and then schedule up to as many

              12  as 10 patients for consults, immediately -- in

              13  time slots right after the surgery was to

              14  begin?

              15             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form,

              16  foundation.

              17          A.   I don't recall that exactly, no.

              18          Q.   Do you know what a physician

              19  extender is?

              20          A.   Yes, like a nurse practitioner or

              21  a PA.

              22          Q.   And as of the time period that

              23  you were working a supervisory role, do you

              24  know -- did you have any understanding as to

              25  what the standard of care was with regard to



                                                               86


               1  the use of physician extenders in either

               2  cardiothoracic surgeon's practices, or

               3  cardiologist's practices?

               4             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, relevance.

               5  This goes beyond federal evidence rule 611(b)

               6  regarding my scope of examination.

               7          A.   Am I answering that one, right?

               8          Q.   Yes.

               9          A.   Okay.  So what do you mean

              10  exactly do I know what the --

              11          Q.   Okay.  Well, were you aware that

              12  as of the time periods that you were the

              13  supervisor of CT surgery, April 2014 through

              14  November 2016 --

              15          A.   Uh-huh.

              16          Q.   -- were you ever made aware that

              17  cardiologists used physician extenders to see

              18  patients when they would go to the office, as

              19  opposed to in the hospital?

              20          A.   Not directly.

              21          Q.   Okay.  But you indirectly knew

              22  that?

              23          A.   I would I say I know that PAs can

              24  see patients independently.  Is that what

              25  you're asking?



                                                               87


               1          Q.   Well, yes.  But -- okay.  But in

               2  terms of cardiologists, were you aware of,

               3  when you were at Mercy, in your role at CT

               4  surgery, not surgery --

               5          A.   Sure.

               6          Q.   -- were you ever made aware, or

               7  do you have no knowledge, it's okay if you

               8  don't, one way or the other --

               9          A.   Right.

              10          Q.   -- about what practices the

              11  cardiologists used with using physician

              12  extenders to see patients in the office, as

              13  opposed to when a patient was admitted to the

              14  hospital?

              15          A.   So in a general cardiology

              16  practice, no --

              17          Q.   Yes.

              18          A.   -- I had no oversight over that.

              19          Q.   Now, so -- and then in terms of

              20  surgical practice, you're aware that there are

              21  patients that are in the hospital, and then

              22  are seen on rounds when they're in the

              23  hospital, correct?

              24          A.   Yes.

              25          Q.   And are physician assistants ever



                                                               88


               1  used to do those rounds, to your knowledge, as

               2  opposed to seeing people in -- in office,

               3  after the discharge from the hospital?

               4          A.   So I do believe that physician

               5  extenders can see patients in both, in the

               6  hospital, but I don't know that they can see

               7  them necessarily independently in the hospital

               8  setting.

               9          Q.   Okay.

              10          A.   But I don't -- again, that's an

              11  inpatient type of thing that would be

              12  regulated by like bylaws or something.

              13          Q.   I understand.  But you understood

              14  that when a patient is in the hospital, that

              15  there may be --

              16          A.   Uh-huh.

              17          Q.   -- an additional need for them to

              18  not -- they can't see them necessarily alone.

              19  They might have to also see them with a

              20  doctor, or have a doctor sign off on what

              21  they're doing?

              22          A.   I think it depends on the type of

              23  visit it is, like a consult, versus a

              24  follow-up or something, but I don't know that.

              25          Q.   And then in terms of a patient



                                                               89


               1  returning to the office, as opposed to the

               2  hospital --

               3          A.   Uh-huh.

               4          Q.   -- do you understand that there

               5  is a difference in terms of what a physician

               6  assistant, or an extender can do in that

               7  setting, as opposed to when it's in the

               8  hospital?

               9          A.   I guess my question is what is

              10  the scenario you're saying that I'm trying to

              11  differentiate between the hospital versus the

              12  clinic?

              13          Q.   Yeah.  I'll explain to you.

              14          A.   Okay.

              15          Q.   So a person comes into the -- for

              16  surgery.

              17          A.   Uh-huh.

              18          Q.   And they're an inpatient in the

              19  hospital.

              20          A.   Uh-huh.

              21          Q.   And then they're discharged from

              22  the hospital, so --

              23          A.   Right.

              24          Q.   -- that would be a person being

              25  seen on rounds while they're an inpatient in



                                                               90


               1  the hospital.

               2          A.   Right.  I get that part.

               3          Q.   However long they're there.

               4          A.   Okay.

               5          Q.   Then you have a patient that gets

               6  discharged --

               7          A.   Uh-huh.

               8          Q.   -- and ultimately return backs to

               9  see the surgical practice as an outpatient.

              10          A.   Uh-huh.

              11          Q.   As a postop visit.

              12          A.   Right.

              13          Q.   Did you have an understanding

              14  that a physician assistant could have a larger

              15  role there, as opposed to in the hospital

              16  setting, when the person was admitted?

              17          A.   Yes.  It's been my -- I mean,

              18  obviously the physician assistant cannot do

              19  surgery, so it's my understanding that it kind

              20  of depends on the specialty.

              21          Q.   Did you have --

              22          A.   Depending on how they want to

              23  utilize their physician extenders, since it's

              24  an extension of them.

              25          Q.   Did you have an understanding,



                                                               91


               1  though, that a physician assistant, or

               2  extender, could in fact see a patient in the

               3  office, alone, if the patient was returning,

               4  as opposed to being admitted in the hospital?

               5             MR. WIENCEK:  Objection, form and

               6  foundation.

               7          A.   I believe it's within their scope

               8  to do so.

               9          Q.   And do you know approximately how

              10  many patients a week of Dr. Holland's --

              11  Doctor -- Mr. Carruthers would see in the

              12  office, either he or Mr. Brown?

              13          A.   How many?

              14          Q.   Yes.

              15          A.   No, I would be guessing.

              16          Q.   Would you -- did -- were you

              17  aware of surgical volumes, in terms of

              18  Dr. Holland versus Dr. Hashmi's surgical

              19  volumes?

              20          A.   I was aware of -- yes.  I was

              21  aware of some of that.

              22          Q.   Just generally speaking --

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   -- you knew numbers, but you

              25  didn't look into the specifics of why



                                                               92


               1  necessarily one person had more referrals than

               2  the other?

               3          A.   No.

               4          Q.   That wasn't your role, correct?

               5          A.   Right.

               6          Q.   Now, so in terms of that, were

               7  you ever -- strike that.

               8             In terms of the time that Adam or

               9  Mr. Brown would have to contribute to

              10  Dr. Holland's patients in the office, do you

              11  know how much time that was relate -- in

              12  relation to how much time they'd spend to see

              13  Dr. Hashmi's patients in the office?

              14          A.   No.  Again, I would be guessing.

              15          Q.   Okay.  I don't want you to guess

              16  --

              17          A.   Yes.

              18          Q.   -- or speculate.  Fair enough.

              19          A.   Okay.

              20          Q.   So if I told you, for example,

              21  that Dr. Holland may average one to one and a

              22  half patients a week, versus Dr. Hashmi seeing

              23  a significantly more, 10 or more a week, those

              24  numbers would not be familiar to you, correct?

              25          A.   No, I don't know that they would



                                                               93


               1  be familiar.  I -- I understood that

               2  Dr. Holland's volume was lower than

               3  Dr. Hashmi's, if that's what you're asking.

               4          Q.   Fair enough.

               5             I think we understand how much you

               6  know or don't know there.

               7          A.   Uh-huh.

               8          Q.   Not too much more, I promise.

               9             Exhibit 101 in the binder, I

              10  believe.  101 in your binder.

              11          A.   Yeah.

              12          Q.   Now, if you see Exhibit 101, this

              13  is marked MSV 4149.

              14          A.   Yes.

              15          Q.   At the bottom, there is an email

              16  from you to Ms. Beckstead, conversation with

              17  Adam Carruthers 4/25/2015.

              18             Do you see that?

              19          A.   Yes.

              20          Q.   And then earlier today, we had

              21  looked at what appears to be, in Haaser

              22  Exhibit A?

              23          A.   Yes.

              24          Q.   And then I was just going to show

              25  you these for reference purposes.



                                                               94


               1          A.   Sure.

               2          Q.   You can see that the subject of

               3  the conversation appears to be the same, along

               4  with the title document there.

               5          A.   Yes.

               6          Q.   Okay.  Just -- I wanted you to

               7  have a reference.

               8          A.   Sure.

               9          Q.   And then -- and then this went up

              10  -- you see that there is a responsive email

              11  from Jayne, and then there is -- you wrote

              12  another email, correct?

              13          A.   Correct.

              14          Q.   And then here, you wrote, at the

              15  top, one of those PG comments-Holland.csv.

              16             Do you know what that was?

              17          A.   Yes.  I believe it was a Press

              18  Ganey comments.

              19          Q.   And what is that exactly?

              20          A.   Press Ganey is a vendor that we

              21  use to do our patient satisfaction surveys.

              22          Q.   And then what -- what would they

              23  do?  They would send out surveys to patients

              24  or their family postsurgery and things of that

              25  nature?



                                                               95


               1          A.   Yep.  So randomly patients are

               2  selected, and surveys are sent out, following

               3  any type of encounter or appointment.

               4          Q.   And there is no -- you didn't --

               5  you sent this data along, to the best of your

               6  knowledge, to Ms. Beckstead, this email,

               7  correct?

               8          A.   Correct.

               9          Q.   Okay.  And then the next one is

              10  quarterly Press Ganey patient

              11  satisfaction.holland.ppt.  Do you see that?

              12          A.   Yes.

              13          Q.   And do you know what that was?

              14          A.   I believe it's another report,

              15  power, maybe a PowerPoint with the PPT there,

              16  that come -- that we can pull from Press

              17  Ganey.

              18          Q.   Okay.  And this had to do with

              19  patients' responses, or strike that.

              20             The email itself says, I attached

              21  comments from all of 2014 until now.  There

              22  was one I highlighted, but many were positive.

              23  I also attached the patient satisfaction

              24  scores and ran a quarterly.  Let me know if

              25  you'd like anything else.



                                                               96


               1          A.   Yes.

               2          Q.   Okay.  And then if she had wanted

               3  anything else from you, you would have

               4  expected some type of email saying, yes, I

               5  need something else from you?

               6          A.   Correct.

               7          Q.   So if the chain ends here, and

               8  there was no response, that would indicate to

               9  you that you weren't asked for anything else,

              10  correct?

              11          A.   Correct.

              12          Q.   Is it correct that when you were

              13  going through these, that you noticed that

              14  many were positive from patients as to

              15  Dr. Holland?

              16          A.   Yes.

              17          Q.   Now, you didn't, to your

              18  knowledge, there is no reason that you can

              19  think of that -- that the CSV document, or the

              20  PPT document wouldn't still exist as of today?

              21  You didn't take any steps to get rid of that,

              22  or do anything to delete those, correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   Now, I think -- you also

              25  testified today, you said that there were --



                                                               97


               1  there were nurses that did not like

               2  Dr. Holland, or working with him?

               3          A.   That's what I was told, yes.

               4          Q.   Who told you that?

               5          A.   I heard it from Elizabeth, as

               6  well as Adam.

               7          Q.   So you were never given firsthand

               8  account from any nurses, correct?

               9          A.   No.  This would be inpatient

              10  nurses.

              11          Q.   Do you recall any names that were

              12  used?

              13          A.   No.

              14          Q.   I'm going to fast forward a

              15  little bit now in time.  I'm going to fast

              16  forward to August of 2016, roughly, okay?

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   And I'll tell you what the -- you

              19  were carbon copied on an email.  I just want

              20  to ask you what you remember about this.

              21             There was a candidate that was

              22  brought to Mercy named Sulaiman Bashir Hasan,

              23  a doctor, a cardiothoracic surgeon.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   And you were carbon copied on an



                                                               98


               1  email, amongst many other people, about him

               2  coming to be interviewed --

               3          A.   Okay.

               4          Q.   -- as of August 2016.

               5             Do you remember anything about

               6  that, about his interview, what involvement,

               7  if any, you would have in that process?

               8          A.   No.  I don't think I was involved

               9  in that interview.

              10          Q.   You might have been carbon

              11  copied, but it might have, for whatever reason

              12  --

              13          A.   I think typically they send it to

              14  a group of people that, just as an awareness.

              15          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.

              16             And then -- and then I -- the last

              17  area of questioning about.  You ended your

              18  role as, in the CT surgery in November 2016.

              19  And then you went to director of operations,

              20  correct?

              21          A.   Correct.

              22          Q.   Now, in or about February of

              23  2017, there were issues that arose with regard

              24  to Dr. Holland and coverage with

              25  Mr. Carruthers.  Do you recall those



                                                               99


               1  generally?  Do you recall issues occurring?

               2          A.   With coverage for Dr. Holland?

               3          Q.   Yes.

               4          A.   Not exactly.

               5          Q.   Okay.  There is an email that

               6  might help you.

               7          A.   Okay.

               8          Q.   It's Exhibit 112.

               9          A.   Thank you.

              10          Q.   And then I have another one to

              11  hand out, I think, at some point.

              12          A.   Okay.

              13          Q.   Let me -- let me hand this one

              14  out now.  Now, what is our next number?  123?

              15             THE REPORTER:  Yes.

              16             MR. ARCHINACO:  Okay.  Thank you.

              17  You want to mark this 123?  And I'll just hand

              18  this one out, and you can look at this one

              19  also, because they're sort of in context.

              20  This one is earlier.

              21             (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 123

              22  was marked for identification.)

              23          Q.   (By Mr. Archinaco) And then there

              24  is one other I'll direct you to to help you

              25  out, that is -- that is subsequent to these.



                                                               100


               1  So the Exhibit 123 is January 19th.

               2          A.   Uh-huh.

               3          Q.   Then you have February 22nd, and

               4  I'll have you look at one more, and then I'll

               5  ask you about these general topics.  If you

               6  could turn to Exhibit 99.  And you know what,

               7  why don't you leave it in, where 112 is, so

               8  you can turn back easier, because I'm going to

               9  bring you back to it.  But if you turn to 99.

              10          A.   Can I pull out 99 and put it this

              11  way, so I can see them in order?

              12  (Indicating.)

              13          Q.   You can, if you want to do that.

              14          A.   That would just be helpful.

              15          Q.   No.  That's perfectly fine.

              16  We'll put it back later.

              17          A.   Okay.

              18          Q.   I think I'm going to do the same

              19  thing, as it will make it go faster.

              20          A.   Keep it in order.

              21          Q.   Yeah.  It will make it go faster.

              22          A.   Okay.

              23          Q.   All right.  So you've had a

              24  chance to look at these three various exhibits

              25  99, 112 and 123?



                                                               101


               1          A.   Uh-huh.

               2          Q.   Correct?

               3          A.   Yes.

               4          Q.   Okay.  And these all pertain to a

               5  similar time period having to do with -- well,

               6  we'll start with the first one, Exhibit 123?

               7          A.   Uh-huh.

               8          Q.   What is your recollection as to

               9  what was occurring as -- in or about January

              10  of 2019 -- 2017, when this email was sent by

              11  you?

              12          A.   Yep.  So at this time, I was

              13  transitioning everything over to the person

              14  that was taking on my old role.  And so I was

              15  responsible, when I was in the regional

              16  manager role, for paying Toledo Clinic for

              17  Dr. Holland's services.  So it looks like I

              18  was just making sure at what time I was to

              19  stop doing that.

              20          Q.   So you had an understanding that

              21  Dr. Holland was leaving; is that correct?

              22          A.   Yes.

              23          Q.   And how did you come to have that

              24  understanding?

              25          A.   I believe from the email that



                                                               102


               1  Olivia had sent me here.

               2          Q.   Do you believe that was the first

               3  notice you knew that Dr. Holland was leaving?

               4          A.   I believe so.

               5          Q.   Did you ever -- were you ever -

               6  strike that.

               7             Were you ever told, or given any

               8  understanding, as to why Dr. Holland was

               9  leaving?

              10          A.   No.  Just that we were

              11  terminating the agreement with Toledo Clinic.

              12          Q.   And who told you that that

              13  agreement was being terminated?

              14          A.   I don't recall, but by here,

              15  Olivia making sure just that I was aware, so I

              16  didn't pay him beyond that point to Toledo

              17  Clinic.

              18          Q.   Now, in Exhibit 112, which is the

              19  next in the sequence.

              20          A.   Uh-huh.

              21          Q.   From February 22nd.  This is an

              22  email from you to Mr. Hood and others.

              23          A.   Uh-huh.

              24          Q.   What was the purpose of this

              25  email?



                                                               103


               1          A.   So in reading this, I -- I

               2  believe I was trying to ascertain what

               3  Dr. Holland's, if he was going to continue to

               4  do surgery.  Even though the agreement with

               5  Toledo Clinic was terminated, if he still had

               6  privileges, he could perform surgery, and I

               7  was trying to understand if our employed PAs

               8  that supported the CT surgery physician

               9  practice were going to continue to support

              10  him, or if someone in the hospital was going

              11  to do that piece.

              12          Q.   Okay.  And so you're -- you're

              13  making an actual inquiry into this, because

              14  this may arise, from what you can tell,

              15  correct?  That issue -- an issue may arise, is

              16  he getting coverage from us or not, right?

              17          A.   I was just trying to understand

              18  if, right, from a CT surgery standpoint, would

              19  Adam still be responsible for covering him, or

              20  how was that to work.

              21          Q.   And so you're running it up to

              22  superiors to get an answer, correct?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   Okay.

              25          A.   Uh-huh.



                                                               104


               1          Q.   Now, on the next exhibit we have

               2  in the sequence is from March 1.  Now, this is

               3  an Adam -- this is, I'll represent to you, an

               4  email from Mr. Carruthers --

               5          A.   Uh-huh.

               6          Q.   -- to Mr., or to Dr. Holland.

               7  And he's documenting Tuesday 2/28 at roughly

               8  noon.

               9          A.   Uh-huh.

              10          Q.   He documents here, I called

              11  Dr. Holland and Jeff, St. Anne's OR doctor, to

              12  inform them Jennifer Haaser had called to

              13  inform us we would no longer be providing

              14  Dr. Holland with a first assist as of

              15  3/1/2017.  She had also notified Keith Hanf,

              16  St. Vincent's OR director, and Greg Hood,

              17  St. Vincent's director of inpatient care and

              18  services of the same.  Did I read that

              19  generally correctly?

              20          A.   Yes.

              21          Q.   Now, do you recall who it --

              22  first of all, do you recall this happening,

              23  that you called and informed -- well, let's go

              24  back a second.

              25          A.   Sure.



                                                               105


               1          Q.   Do you recall who told you, if

               2  anyone, that services would no longer be

               3  provided to Dr. Holland with the first assist

               4  of as of March 1st?

               5          A.   So I do recall, I don't remember

               6  exactly who, if it would have been Michele, or

               7  Jayne, or someone had told me, because I had

               8  sent the email.  And I don't know if I ever

               9  received a response on this, but I do believe

              10  I was asking.  And that the -- that the

              11  physician group would not be supplying the

              12  first assist for Dr. Holland going forward,

              13  since the termination with Toledo Clinic.

              14          Q.   And I just want to be clear in

              15  terms of where your role in terms of it.

              16          A.   Sure.

              17          Q.   Although you may have called

              18  Mr. Carruthers to say that, that wasn't a

              19  decision you made?

              20          A.   Correct.

              21          Q.   Somebody above you made that

              22  decision?

              23          A.   Correct.

              24          Q.   Do you know who it was who

              25  ultimately made that decision?



                                                               106


               1          A.   I don't remember, but I do

               2  remember this happening, because I was trying

               3  to clarify, again, because we were supporting

               4  the practice, and he was no longer going to be

               5  a piece of that, through the agreement.

               6          Q.   And as of 2017, who did

               7  Ms. Beckstead at that point report to?

               8          A.   It would -- it would either have

               9  been Michele Montague or Todd Warner.  I don't

              10  know the timeline there.

              11          Q.   Okay.  And -- and then they would

              12  report up to who, do you know?

              13          A.   Then they would have reported up

              14  to Dr. Andrabi on the physician side.

              15          Q.   And Keith Hanf, he was -- what

              16  was his role?

              17          A.   He was the OR director at

              18  St. Vincent's.

              19          Q.   And then you have Danielle

              20  Linear, who was she?

              21          A.   She was the practice manager then

              22  at the time.

              23          Q.   She had replaced Ms. Sheroian?

              24          A.   Correct.

              25          Q.   Do you know why Ms. Sheroian had



                                                               107


               1  left?

               2          A.   I know she resigned.  She had

               3  another opportunity at UT.

               4          Q.   Were you friends with

               5  Ms. Sheroian?

               6          A.   No.

               7          Q.   In terms of this lawsuit, have

               8  you, other than -- and I don't want to know

               9  about the meeting right now with Mr. Wiencek

              10  -- have you had any discussions with anyone

              11  else about this case or the facts of it?

              12          A.   No.

              13          Q.   With any employees of Mercy, or

              14  former employees of Mercy?

              15          A.   No.  I did -- my boss, Michele

              16  Montague, knows.

              17          Q.   She knows you're going to testify

              18  and --

              19          A.   She knows I was being deposed.

              20          Q.   Okay.  Fair enough.  Just give

              21  me a minute or two here.

              22             I think that's all we have.  Thank

              23  you.

              24          A.   Okay.

              25          Q.   Appreciate it.

               1                    REEXAMINATION

               2  BY MR. WIENCEK:

               3          Q.   Has Karl Strauss been involved in

               4  preparing you for this deposition at all?

               5          A.   No.

               6          Q.   As he provided you with any

               7  input?

               8          A.   No.

               9          Q.   Do you know whether or not

              10  Dr. Holland continued to receive support from

              11  first assistants, after he -- after the

              12  service agreement was terminated?

              13          A.   From either our people or the

              14  hospital?

              15          Q.   That's correct.

              16          A.   I'm not sure exactly what ended

              17  up happening.

              18          Q.   Okay.

              19          A.   Uh-huh.

              20          Q.   Do you know whether any

              21  physician's assistant was ever actually taken

              22  away from him?

              23             MR. ARCHINACO:  Object to the form.

              24          A.   Not that I recall.

              25          Q.   Okay.  I have no further.  We



                                                               109


               1  will read, and we will take a copy.

               2             MR. ARCHINACO:  We'll have a copy

               3  also, yes.

               4             (Whereupon, at 2:50, the deposition

               5  concluded.)

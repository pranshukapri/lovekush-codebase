24  a witness herein, having been first duly sworn, was 

25  examined and testified as follows:


                                                               5

 1                     DIRECT EXAMINATION
                                
 2  BY MR. FLAHERTY:

 3      Q.   Good morning, Doctor.  Would you please 

 4  introduce yourself to the jury.

 5      A.   Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Honor.  

 6  My name is Lance Owen Yarus, D.O.

 7      Q.   And we are here today to take your testimony on 

 8  behalf of a client of mine, Lillian Pfaff, that you 

 9  evaluated back in 2018 with regard to an accident she had 

10  in May of 2016. 

11           I'm going to be asking you a couple of questions 

12  today about some opinions from that evaluation.  Before 

13  we do that, I do have to talk about your credentials and 

14  your education, not only to qualify you as an expert, but 

15  also for the benefit of the jury.  Can you tell me what 

16  type of physician you are?

17      A.   The D.O. after my name stands for doctor of 

18  osteopathy.  I specialize in the areas of orthopedics and 

19  pain management.  

20      Q.   Okay.  And are you licensed to practice in the 

21  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?

22      A.   Yes, I am.

23      Q.   Doctor, are you a surgeon?

24      A.   Yes.

25      Q.   Can you tell me what orthopedics means?  


                                                               6

 1      A.   Orthopedics is a subspecialty in medicine that 

 2  deals with the spinal column that includes the neck, mid 

 3  back, and low back, and all of the structures that are 

 4  associated with it, including the disks and nerves that 

 5  supply motor and sensory function to the extremities, 

 6  also deals with the joint areas, the muscles, tendons, 

 7  and ligaments and internal structures in the joints, and 

 8  then nerves and vessels that travel in the extremities.  

 9           We also deal with people who have traumatic 

10  injuries to those areas, individuals who have arthritic 

11  conditions, and certainly we treat conservatively and 

12  have the training to do surgery in those areas if the 

13  need arises.

14      Q.   And can you tell the jury please about the 

15  process of becoming an orthopedic surgeon?

16      A.   The process after graduating medical school and 

17  doing a one-year internship entails a four-year program 

18  wherein you are just doing orthopedics and taking care of 

19  patients who come through the emergency facility.  You 

20  get the opportunity to be in clinic setting, sometimes in 

21  private physicians' offices.  So you are getting a 

22  well-rounded education in that regard and then actually 

23  going to the operating room and participating in 

24  surgeries and doing the surgeries under the direction of 

25  the individuals who have privileges in the hospital 


                                                               7

 1  setting and also outpatient settings as well.  

 2      Q.   Can you tell the jury how long you've been a 

 3  physician?

 4      A.   I've been a physician since 1981.  That's when I 

 5  graduated medical school.

 6      Q.   And are you board certified?

 7      A.   Yes, I am.  

 8      Q.   In what specialties?

 9      A.   I hold certificates in orthopedics and pain 

10  management.

11      Q.   What does board certification mean?

12      A.   Well, in the surgical subspecialty it means that 

13  you've met the requirements of independently incorporated 

14  boards.  There is three of them in Pennsylvania.  I'm 

15  certified by one of them.  They are recognized as equal.  

16  So when you meet the requirements, taking tests and then 

17  the last year actually being watched doing surgery by 

18  board certified individuals, who also review your charts 

19  in the hospital and office setting for the two years 

20  before, you receive a certificate.  So that's for me 1989 

21  my first certificate. 

22           After that there is recertification, and that 

23  just entails taking written tests, and I have done that 

24  successfully three times up to 2011, and I hold the 

25  certificate that designates Emeritus status.  


                                                               8

 1      Q.   Have you previously been qualified to testify as 

 2  an expert in Allegheny County and other Pennsylvania 

 3  courts?

 4      A.   Yes, I have.

 5      Q.   Could you take a look at what's been marked as 

 6  Exhibit 1 in front of you.  Do you recognize that 

 7  document?

 8           (Yarus Exhibit No. 1 was marked for 

 9  identification.)

10      A.   I do, yes.

11      Q.   Can you identify it for me?

12      A.   This is called a curriculum vitae.

13      Q.   And is that a true and correct copy of your CV?

14      A.   Yes, it is.

15      Q.   Doctor, have you ever been published in the 

16  field?

17      A.   As a resident I had publications, along with my 

18  physicians who were trainers, but in practice, no, I have 

19  not.

20      Q.   And have you held any academic positions in your 

21  time as a physician?

22      A.   I had two academic positions.  My last one was 

23  1994 as associate professor at Hershey Medical Center.  

24      Q.   And do you train the future generation of 

25  doctors these days?


                                                               9

 1      A.   I'm still privileged to have young individuals 

 2  come to the office in various stages of vocational 

 3  training or those who want to be physicians.  So, yes, I 

 4  just recently had somebody with me this last couple of 

 5  weeks.

 6      Q.   And tell the jury about your current practice.

 7      A.   I would call my current practice a dual practice.  

 8  Orthopedics and pain management are married very well 

 9  together, in that you can't have one without the other. 

10  People who have injuries particularly have pain.  

11           I get to see individuals also who have metabolic 

12  diseases, such as muscular dystrophies, cerebral palsy, 

13  multiple sclerosis, and those individuals, unfortunately, 

14  have pain associated with their disease state.  So you can 

15  treat those individuals by doing a number of techniques to 

16  try and deaden their pain and also using medications we 

17  can help as well.

18      Q.   And as part of your practice do you treat 

19  individuals who have been injured in car accidents and 

20  other accidents?

21      A.   Yes.

22      Q.   Do you regularly treat patients with shoulder and 

23  other joint injuries?

24      A.   Yes, I do.

25      Q.   And as part of your practice, do you routinely 


                                                               10

 1  review and rely on medical records and diagnostic studies 

 2  from other practitioners?

 3      A.   Yes.

 4      Q.   Do you interpret those studies yourself as well?

 5      A.   I have the training to do so.  I'm not a 

 6  radiologist, I'm not a neuro-diagnostician, but I have to 

 7  be able to look at those studies and make determinations 

 8  for patients particularly.  So, yes, I can look at them 

 9  and certainly understand the morphologic concepts, what 

10  the anatomy looks -- so I am doing that all the time.

11      Q.   And are you familiar with the cost associated 

12  with orthopedic care not only in the state, but also on 

13  the side of the state?

14      A.   Yes.

15           MR. FLAHERTY:  Thank you, Doctor.  At this time I 

16  will allow Mr. Lang to ask you some questions about your 

17  qualifications.

18           THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

19                            -----

20                    VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

21  BY MR. LANG:

22      Q.   Dr. Yarus, since Attorney Flaherty has been 

23  asking you about your resume, let me start there.  Where 

24  did you go to college?

25      A.   I went to Syracuse University.


                                                               11

 1      Q.   All right.  In looking at your -- I have two 

 2  resumes from your -- or CVs.  The first resume has that 

 3  you obtained a bachelor of arthritis psychology from 

 4  Syracuse University.  What exactly is a bachelor of 

 5  arthritis psychology?  

 6      A.   Well, I would call that a typographical error.  

 7  That's why we have updated ones.  I knew that was a 

 8  problem there.  There is no such thing, obviously.  It's 

 9  a bachelor of arts, and my area of study was in 

10  psychology.

11      Q.   I see.  Okay.  So this resume that I was 

12  supplied is not correct, the one that refers to bachelor 

13  of arthritis?

14      A.   Yes.  It's quite old and had that pointed out to 

15  me about two years ago, so it's an old one.  The one I 

16  gave you is up to date.  

17      Q.   So that's been removed from your current resume; 

18  correct?  

19      A.   Oh, yes.  It's been corrected.

20      Q.   All right.  And I'm just looking at -- your 

21  resume is a little somewhat out of chronological order, 

22  but you went to Friends Select School.  I assume that's 

23  high school; is that correct?

24      A.   Correct.

25      Q.   And then the next entry is 1977 graduate year 


                                                               12

 1  Syracuse University.  What does that mean graduate year?  

 2  Is that the year you graduated from Syracuse, 1977?  

 3      A.   Right.  I finished in three years.  I left in 

 4  1976.  The certificate year is 1977.  They don't let you 

 5  graduate early at Syracuse.

 6      Q.   And the next entry is Saint Joseph's University, 

 7  1976.  So did you go to Saint Joseph's while you were at 

 8  Syracuse?

 9      A.   When I left Syracuse in the winter time, I went 

10  to Saint Joe's, started my psychobiology graduate work, so 

11  it was the same year that I left Syracuse.  It was in the 

12  winter time that I started.

13      Q.   And then you went to -- you did post graduate 

14  work at Drexel in 1978?

15      A.   That's correct.

16      Q.   Then in 1972 to 1981 you were at Des Moines 

17  University, College of Osteopathic Medicine; is that 

18  correct?

19      A.   1978 to '81.  

20      Q.   '78 to '81?

21      A.   Yes.  Is there a typographical on that one?  

22      Q.   All right.  And that's in Des Moines, Iowa.  Is 

23  that where you got your medical degree?

24      A.   That is correct, yes. 

25      Q.   I also saw on your resume that you spent time at 


                                                               13

 1  the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey;  

 2  is that correct?

 3      A.   Right.  It originally was Memorial Hospital.  I 

 4  started there working with an orthopod when I was 16 years 

 5  old actually, but it changed its name when UMDNJ bought 

 6  it, so it became a university when I left.

 7      Q.   Just so I'm clear, is that a dental school where 

 8  you trained in dentistry as well?

 9      A.   No.  It's actually a medical and dentist school 

10  both.

11      Q.   I see.  And then you went to the Philadelphia 

12  College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery; correct?  

13      A.   I didn't go there.  I did my residency there.  I 

14  finished my residency in the last three years.

15      Q.   I see.  And the two resumes that I have, one is 

16  on a letterhead from Cypress Orthopedic Pain Management 

17  and Rehabilitation Centers; and the other one is on Tall 

18  Oaks Therapeutics and Rehabilitation Center.

19      A.   Yes.

20      Q.   The first one, the Cypress Orthopedic, has an 

21  address in Philadelphia, and the Tall Oaks has an address 

22  in Pittsburgh.

23      A.   That's correct.

24      Q.   Why do you have letterhead -- resumes on two 

25  different letterheads?


                                                               14

 1      A.   Well, look at the bottom right-hand corner, at 

 2  the bottom of the page there is a little tree there and 

 3  it's a division of Regional Orthopedics, basically the 

 4  fictitious names to designate which one we are talking 

 5  about.  Instead of saying Philadelphia, because there is 

 6  already Philadelphia Orthopedics, we name them by trees.

 7      Q.   Okay.  But I'm just curious why two different 

 8  names on two different resumes.

 9      A.   It depends on what was given to me, as far as 

10  what was printed out.  So for today we are here, 

11  obviously, in Pittsburgh, so we use the Pittsburgh address 

12  where my office is.  So that would be the only reason.  

13  They're both the same, actually.

14      Q.   So the Pittsburgh address is 500 Grant Street in 

15  Pittsburgh, Suite 2900; correct?

16      A.   That is correct.

17      Q.   And that is the old address of Simon & Simon back 

18  in October of 2018 when you saw Ms. Pfaff; is that 

19  correct?  

20      A.   Not that I'm aware of.  I don't know what Simon & 

21  Simon office situation was, but as far as I know, they're 

22  not in my suite.  That's a whole suite.  I have -- I'm  

23  No. 22 in that suite.

24      Q.   And is that where you saw Ms. Pfaff?

25      A.   Yes.  That is my office.


                                                               15

 1      Q.   You still have an office there?  

 2      A.   Yes.

 3      Q.   And what exactly does that office consist of?  Do 

 4  you have staff there?  Do you have equipment there?

 5      A.   Well, there is three receptionists who will 

 6  manage the individuals who come to see me, and then in the 

 7  office itself I have an exam table, a stool for the exam 

 8  table, a desk, a computer.  I have a copier there.  I have 

 9  all of the tools I need to do examinations.

10      Q.   And, um, do you man that office full time?

11      A.   Well, I'm not there full time.  I come a couple 

12  of times a month, depending on who has booked patients.  I 

13  also do medical marijuana.  So if there are individuals 

14  who are scheduled for that, I'll see them there.

15      Q.   What do you mean you see individuals for medical 

16  marijuana?  I didn't understand that.

17      A.   I'm certified to give certification for cannabis, 

18  medical cannabis.  So I see those individuals as well.

19      Q.   I see.  All right.  You were talking about your 

20  board certifications.  You -- am I correct that you are 

21  certified by the American Association of Physician 

22  Specialists?

23      A.   That's correct.

24      Q.   And you said that's one of three board certifying 

25  entities in Pennsylvania?


                                                               16

 1      A.   That's correct.

 2      Q.   What are the other two?

 3      A.   ABMS which is an M.D. board, and then there is 

 4  AOAO for orthopedics through the AOA which is the 

 5  Osteopathic Association.

 6      Q.   And you are an osteopathic physician; correct?

 7      A.   I certainly am, yes.

 8      Q.   You are not certified by the Osteopathic 

 9  Physicians Board, are you?

10      A.   My board was an osteopathic board.  It's a dual 

11  board now.  It can certify D.O.s and M.D.s.  It's the only 

12  one that does that.

13      Q.   But you're not certified by the AOA?

14      A.   I don't have AOAO certification, that is correct.

15      Q.   Okay.  And just so we are clear, what's the AOA?

16      A.   AOA is American Osteopathic Association.

17      Q.   The American Association of Physician Specialists 

18  that you are certified by, that is not an orthopedic 

19  board, is it?

20      A.   Yes, it is.  Well, it's the parent board to the 

21  American Board of Orthopedics, yes.

22      Q.   But they certify all sorts of specialties, 

23  including dermatology, diagnostic radiology; correct?

24      A.   Yes, so does the ABMS, yes, same thing that the 

25  M.D.s do, the D.O.s do.


                                                               17

 1      Q.   And the American Medical Association, they have a 

 2  board certification; correct?

 3      A.   That is the ABMS, yes.

 4      Q.   That's the ABMS.  What does that stand for?

 5      A.   It almost sounds like my board, American Board of 

 6  Medical Specialties, I believe.

 7      Q.   But the AMA, the American Medical Association, 

 8  that's the oldest medical association in the country; 

 9  correct?

10      A.   That is correct, yes.

11      Q.   And they have a board certification for 

12  orthopedic surgery; correct?

13      A.   As do all three, yes.

14      Q.   And you are not certified by the American Medical 

15  Association, are you?

16      A.   Well, yes, I wouldn't be.  I'm not an M.D.; I'm a 

17  D.O.

18      Q.   The AOA, the American Osteopathic Association; 

19  correct?

20      A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.

21      Q.   You took that test to become board certified 

22  through them; correct?

23      A.   I did, yes.

24      Q.   And you flunked it; correct? 

25      A.   The first time around, yes.


                                                               18

 1      Q.   And you never took it again; correct? 

 2      A.   I did not.  That's correct.  I took it through 

 3  the board by which I'm certified and I recertified, as I 

 4  said, three times in a row the same test.

 5      Q.   All right.  But just so we are clear, you are not 

 6  certified by the AOA or the AMA; correct?

 7      A.   That's correct, yes. 

 8      Q.   You are not on active staff at any hospitals 

 9  currently; correct?

10      A.   You are correct, yes.

11      Q.   You have no privileges at any hospitals since 

12  2016; is that correct?

13      A.   Yes.

14      Q.   You've never had hospital privileges at any 

15  hospital in Pittsburgh; correct?

16      A.   Correct.

17      Q.   You're primarily based in the eastern part of the 

18  state in Philadelphia; correct? 

19      A.   That's fair.  I have two offices there, yes. 

20      Q.   You have not taught medical students since 1994; 

21  correct?

22      A.   Well, as I said, in the formalized setting as an 

23  associate professor, no, but I still see students in the 

24  office.  We have them come and learn about what I do 

25  particularly.


                                                               19

 1      Q.   Let me ask you about that.  You said you are 

 2  currently training some individuals from time to time.  

 3  Who is this through?  Is this through a hospital, a 

 4  university?

 5      A.   It could be a vo-tech, it could be YTI, for 

 6  instance, in Reading.

 7      Q.   We don't know what YTI is in Reading.

 8      A.   It's a school that individuals will go to learn 

 9  various parts of medicine.  They might want to be 

10  physicians, as I said.  They might want to do clerical 

11  work, in-takes, things that we do to get patients squared 

12  away.  It doesn't necessarily mean they're going to become 

13  physicians, but getting into the medical field and doing 

14  those types of things.

15      Q.   So you could be talking about anybody from a 

16  billing clerk to a possible doctor?

17      A.   Well, they're young, so you never know.

18      Q.   How young?  

19      A.   I had one this past two weeks.  I believe she's 

20  28 years old.

21      Q.   But just so I'm -- I'm trying to understand.  You 

22  are not -- actually a medical school or a university isn't 

23  sending people to you for training; correct?

24      A.   That's fair.  Most of them come from, as I said, 

25  vocational training facilities.


                                                               20

 1      Q.   You do not have a board certification relating to 

 2  upper extremities; correct?

 3      A.   There is no such thing, so I wouldn't have one.

 4      Q.   You don't have a subspecialty in orthopedic 

 5  surgery relating to upper extremities; correct?

 6      A.   Well, actually I do.  I have a microvascular 

 7  certificate from the University of Pennsylvania.

 8      Q.   What's a microvascular?

 9      A.   Well, that is actually doing surgeries on 

10  vessels, nerves, through the scope, microscope, so through 

11  the Osterman and Bill Bora.  I have a certificate for 

12  that, and I can show it to you, if you would like.

13      Q.   No.  I don't need to see it.  

14      A.   That's on my CV.

15      Q.   Now, you have a significant relationship with the 

16  law firm of Simon & Simon; correct?

17      A.   Well, I'm not sure what you mean by significant.  

18  I certainly have been privileged to receive referrals from 

19  them for their clients and also people that I might end up 

20  treating, but I don't know that it's significant in the 

21  big picture of my practice.

22      Q.   Okay.  Well, you've made a fair amount of money 

23  from seeing Simon & Simon clients and testifying on behalf 

24  of Simon & Simon clients; correct?

25      A.   My practice has received monies for the work that 


                                                               21

 1  I've done.  So I would say that is true.

 2      Q.   And I assume you are charging for your report 

 3  that you wrote in this case and your time testifying 

 4  today; correct?

 5      A.   You're correct, yes. 

 6      Q.   As all physicians do in these situations.  Do you 

 7  know how much you've charged in this case?

 8      A.   Yes; it was $500.  

 9      Q.   For what?

10      A.   The time I spent with the individual, the time it 

11  took to read the records, and the time it took to dictate 

12  the actual report itself.

13      Q.   What about your testimony today?

14      A.   Testimony is separate for my time today.

15      Q.   How much is that?

16      A.   Thirty-two hundred dollars.

17      Q.   Is this your only deposition today?

18      A.   Yes.

19      Q.   Is this your only deposition this week?

20      A.   Yes.

21      Q.   Did you give any depositions last week?

22      A.   No, I did not.

23      Q.   We are taking your deposition here at the offices 

24  of Simon & Simon; correct?

25      A.   Yes, that's correct.


                                                               22

 1      Q.   And you traveled in from Philadelphia for the 

 2  deposition today; is that correct?

 3      A.   Well, actually I live in Lancaster County, so I 

 4  traveled from Lancaster.  That's about a four-hour ride.

 5      Q.   I see.  All right.  Now, you've answered some 

 6  interrogatories in cases about money that you've made from 

 7  testifying in cases, in particular with respect to Simon & 

 8  Simon clients; correct?

 9      A.   Yes, I have.

10      Q.   And I'm going to have what I've marked as 

11  Defendant's Exhibit A.  These are answers to 

12  interrogatories that you provided in a case in the Court 

13  of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, and it says that in 

14  19 -- excuse me -- in 2017 you received approximately 

15  $600,000 from Simon & Simon; is that correct?

16           (Defendant's Exhibit A was marked for 

17  identification.)

18      A.   I believe that is correct, yes.

19      Q.   And in 2017 you provided 195 video depositions 

20  and 479 medical examinations for the Simon & Simon Law 

21  Firm; is that correct?

22      A.   Those numbers are correct, yes.  

23           MR. FLAHERTY:  I'm going to place an objection to 

24  any kind of reference to interrogatories that aren't from 

25  this case.  Obviously, counsel had the opportunity to 


                                                               23

 1  serve them, he didn't.  It's not this case; it's not this 

 2  county; it's not this jury. 

 3  BY MR. LANG:

 4      Q.   Well, let's go with this.  This is from this 

 5  case, Dr. Yarus.  These are responses you gave to 

 6  interrogatories in this case, the one we are here about 

 7  today.

 8      A.   I'm not looking at it, but I do know that I did 

 9  interrogatories for this particular case, yes.

10      Q.   And you were asked to state the amount of 

11  compensation received in this case, and you, as you said 

12  earlier, $500 for the report and 3,200 for your 

13  deposition; correct?

14      A.   Yes.  

15      Q.   And the number of litigation-related services for 

16  the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 for the Simon & Simon 

17  firm -- or excuse me -- not for the Simon & Simon, in 

18  general, was 970 to 1,000 cases; is that correct?

19      A.   That's correct, yes.

20      Q.   And the income you have derived from these 

21  services in 2016, 2017, and 2018 is between 1.3 million 

22  and $1.5 million; is that correct?

23      A.   That's accurate, yes. 

24      Q.   And then you were asked to state the amount of 

25  income for each year, 2016, 2017, and 2018, garnered or 


                                                               24

 1  earned from the performance of litigation services on 

 2  behalf of Simon & Simon, and your answer was $1.3 million; 

 3  correct?

 4      A.   For those three years, that is correct, yes.

 5           MR. LANG:  We'll mark those as Defendant's 

 6  Exhibit B.

 7           (Defendant's Exhibit B was marked for 

 8  identification.)

 9      Q.   And Doctor, you've seen over 400 people for the 

10  Simon & Simon Law Firm; is that correct?

11      A.   Total?  Yes.

12      Q.   Yes, sir.  

13      A.   That's correct.

14      Q.   You told us a few minutes ago that you've been 

15  qualified as an expert in Allegheny County and elsewhere. 

16  But there have been ten occasions where you were rejected 

17  as an expert; is that correct?  

18           MR. FLAHERTY:  I'm going to place an objection to 

19  the standard involved, especially when it comes to the 

20  Western District or multidistrict litigation.  

21  BY MR. LANG:

22      Q.   You may answer the question, Doctor.

23      A.   Well, the way you posed the question, I would 

24  say, no, that's not correct.

25      Q.   Okay.  What was wrong with my question the way I 


                                                               25

 1  posed it?

 2      A.   My credentials in pedicle screw litigation were 

 3  never denied or restricted.  The issues in pedicle screw 

 4  litigation for the 10 cases you're citing out of 300 that 

 5  I did was in regard to a standard by way of giving 

 6  causation statements when these cases were in Philadelphia 

 7  before they went back to their original states.  I 

 8  followed to the T the PTO orders that Judge Bechtol gave.  

 9  There were two of them, and in each instance even those 

10  cases that you are citing I gave causation statements with 

11  differentials, and I did my job on that alone.  So there 

12  were no trials.  I never went to any courtroom in Utah, 

13  Texas, or Florida, or anywhere else those ten cases were. 

14  My job was in Philadelphia with a multidistrict 

15  litigation.  So I'm aware that my opinions were not 

16  accepted in those ten cases.

17      Q.   Right.  Okay.  So your opinions were not 

18  accepted?

19      A.   Right.  So that's a little different than my 

20  credentials not being accepted.

21      Q.   All right.  Doctor, do you see patients on a 

22  regular basis, on a day-to-day basis?

23      A.   Yes, Monday through Friday.  

24      Q.   Do you see them in -- how many offices do you 

25  have?  You said three?  


                                                               26

 1      A.   Right.  I have two offices toward Philadelphia; 

 2  one is in Lebanon and one is actually in Philadelphia.  So 

 3  Mondays and Thursdays I'm in Philadelphia; Tuesdays, 

 4  Wednesdays in Lebanon, and Friday is spill over day and a 

 5  day where I'll do interventionals for pain management.

 6      Q.   But you don't do any orthopedic surgery; correct? 

 7      A.   I don't do surgery in the operating room anymore 

 8  or in the outpatient setting.  I do procedures in the 

 9  office, as I said, and those are considered surgical 

10  procedures but not the same as opening someone up and 

11  doing spine surgery or knee surgeries, for instance.  So, 

12  no, I don't do those anymore.

13      Q.   What kind of surgeries do you do?

14      A.   Well, the procedures that we do are needle 

15  placements in the spinal column, joints, nerve sheaths.

16      Q.   That's pain management; correct?

17      A.   It's pain management, but it's billed as surgical 

18  procedures, and they are considered surgical procedures.

19      Q.   And why don't you perform surgery?

20      A.   Well, I'm 64 years old.  When I was in my mid 

21  fifties, I decided that I would stop.  It's tough.  I took 

22  call for over thirty years as a solo practitioner and with 

23  two partners doing spine surgery in general orthopedics.  

24  So it takes its toll, and I made a good decision at that 

25  point in time.  That's the only reason.


                                                               27

 1      Q.   Now, I tried to Google your various entities on 

 2  the Internet.  You really don't have a web presence, do 

 3  you? 

 4      A.   I don't do any social media, and I don't do any 

 5  Internet activities at all.

 6      Q.   So how do you get patients?  I mean, if I wanted 

 7  to be a patient of yours, I would have a heck of a time 

 8  trying to find you.  

 9      A.   No; I'm not that hard to find.  If you Google me, 

10  you should be able to see where I'm at, as far as offices.  

11  I don't know that --

12      Q.   But your practice doesn't have a website, for 

13  example?

14      A.   Yes; I don't have a website, but I have been 

15  around for a long time.  I'm well-known.  The people that 

16  refer to me are people that I've known for many, many 

17  years, and then the folks that I'm privileged to evaluate 

18  and treat they are kind enough to refer their own family 

19  members, friends, and people that they know as well.  So 

20  that's how I get my patients.  

21           MR. LANG:  That's all I have on the 

22  qualifications.  Thank you, Doctor.

23           THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.  Thanks.

 1               DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)

 2  BY MR. FLAHERTY:

 3      Q.   Doctor, briefly to finish our voir dire here.  

 4  There were some numbers that were discussed with regard 

 5  to how many patients you may have seen at what time.  As 

 6  a practicing orthopedic surgeon, as you have been in 

 7  years past, is it uncommon for orthos to see ninety or 

 8  more patients a day?

 9      A.   That is quite common.  I did that back in my 

10  earlier days.  I try to keep it to 30, 35 at this point 

11  in time.  I see about 120 a week for treating purposes, 

12  and then in between we'll see these types of cases, 

13  disability evaluations, and impairment evaluations.  So 

14  there's a nice mix but mostly patient care for sure.  

15      Q.   And with regard to this case, specifically 

16  Lillian Pfaff, we are obviously here to talk about the 

17  two shoulder replacements that she had.  Is that a 

18  procedure you performed?

19      A.   Yes.

20      Q.   And would you say you performed it more than a 

21  hundred times?

22      A.   I have, yes. 

23           MR. FLAHERTY:  Any recross on qualifications?

24           MR. LANG:  Yes.

25                              


                                                               29

 1           FURTHER VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

 2  BY MR. LANG:

 3      Q.   Doctor, when is the last time you 

 4  performed an orthopedic shoulder operation?

 5      A.   Well, the last time I operated was in 

 6  2013.  So for that year I think that there were a 

 7  couple of those types of procedures.  

 8  Arthroscopic surgery came into play in the 1970s, 

 9  and we've honed our skills significantly.  So in 

10  cases of trauma or fractures and aggravation 

11  cases where there is arthritis, these are the 

12  type of procedures that are done.  Otherwise, 

13  most procedures in the shoulder anymore are done 

14  through the scope.

15      Q.   Okay.  But my question was very simple.  

16  When is the last time you operated on a shoulder?

17      A.   My answer was 2013.  

18           MR. LANG:  Okay.  Thank you.  

19           THE WITNESS:  You are welcome.  Thanks.

20           MR. FLAHERTY:  At this time.  I would 

21  offer Dr. Lance Yarus as an expert witness in the 

22  fields of orthopedics and pain management.

23

 1           DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)

 2  BY MR. FLAHERTY:

 3      Q.   Doctor, again we are here to take your 

 4  testimony on regard of one of the individuals 

 5  that's my client, Lillian Pfaff, that you 

 6  evaluated following her May 2016 accident.

 7           During your testimony, I'm going to ask 

 8  you for some opinions.  Do me a favor and please 

 9  don't give me any opinions, unless you can do so 

10  to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.  Is 

11  that fair?

12      A.   That's fair and I will do that.

13      Q.   I have asked you to repair -- I'm 

14  sorry -- to prepare a narrative report so you can 

15  testify in this case; is that correct?

16      A.   Yes.

17      Q.   In front of you and also in the pile in 

18  front of you is a document marked Exhibit 2.  Do 

19  you recognize that?

20      A.   Yes, I do.

21      Q.   Is that the report you prepared for my 

22  office regarding Ms. Pfaff?

23      A.   Yes, it is. 

24      Q.   As before, there is no need to have 

25  everything memorized.  Please feel free to refer 


                                                               31

 1  to that as you might need throughout your time here today.  

 2  Can you tell me when you first saw -- or when you saw 

 3  Lillian?

 4      A.   She was in the Pittsburgh office here October 24, 

 5  2018.

 6      Q.   And at that time would you have an opportunity to 

 7  perform a physical exam?

 8      A.   Yes.

 9      Q.   Did you also have the benefit of her prior 

10  medical records and imaging studies before she presented 

11  to your office?

12      A.   Yes, I did.

13      Q.   The first thing is first.  Is this a surgical 

14  case?

15      A.   This is, yes.

16      Q.   After examining Lillian and reviewing her records 

17  and studies, combining your expertise with your 

18  evaluation, can you tell me what diagnoses you came to?

19      A.   Well, Ms. Pfaff had injury to her spinal column, 

20  and I will just say that those injuries are in the form of 

21  soft tissue, in that the disks and structures that involve 

22  the nerves are not an issue here.  So even when I first 

23  met her for the neck, she told me that she did have neck 

24  pain as a result of the motor vehicle accident in which 

25  she was involved, but she said that that pain resolved 


                                                               32

 1  after she had treatment.  So mainly the complaints were in 

 2  regard to the right and left shoulder.  So for those areas 

 3  she had contusions and she had an exacerbation of her 

 4  preexisting degenerative joint disease that was quiescent 

 5  prior to May 26, 2016 which is the date of the motor 

 6  vehicle accident.

 7      Q.   And what did that exacerbation to the shoulders 

 8  cause for Lillian, or what did that require?

 9      A.   Basically it caused pain, and what it required 

10  was to replace the joints for both the right and left 

11  shoulder.

12      Q.   And just so the jury is clear, would you agree 

13  with me that this is an aggravation case.  These are new 

14  injuries for Lillian?

15      A.   There is no question she had it before, but I 

16  would say that based on what I reviewed and what we talked 

17  about, saying quiescent means that the issues of arthritis 

18  were not causing her functional problems or her ability to 

19  carry out with her activities for the most part.

20      Q.   And without necessarily going to exactly what 

21  Ms. Pfaff's problems was right now, can you just briefly 

22  explain to the jury what the shoulder anatomy is like?  

23      A.   Well, shoulder anatomy is very interesting, 

24  because it's not like the hip, in that you have the head 

25  of the bone sitting in a socket.  There is a socket in the 


                                                               33

 1  shoulder, but it sits pretty much vertically, and it is 

 2  very, very shallow.  So the head will ride in that socket, 

 3  and the stabilization for the head is four tendons that 

 4  are the rotator cuff, and the four tendons spell the words 

 5  S.I.T.S, S-I-T-S.  So those are the main structures that 

 6  stabilize the shoulder.  There is also a capsule in the 

 7  joint that surrounds the head and the socket which is 

 8  called the glenoid fossa.  The head is the humeral head, 

 9  and above the head is a bone that you can actually touch 

10  in your own shoulder.  It's squared off at the edge.  That 

11  comes off the scapula which is called the acromion, and 

12  then there is the clavicle which is the collarbone which 

13  meets the acromion and forms a joint.  So all of these 

14  anatomical structures that I just mentioned make up what 

15  we call the shoulder girdle.  

16           Inside the joint on the socket is a lip that's 

17  called the labrum, and that cushions the head as it rides 

18  or moves in the socket when you go through range of 

19  motion.  There is a plexus of nerves that sit in that area 

20  as well right in front of the head.  It's called the 

21  brachial plexus, so that supplies motor and sensory 

22  function as well as the nerves that comes out of the neck 

23  and form those nerves that eventually fan off into the 

24  extremities.

25      Q.   How does that joint wear down over time?  


                                                               34

 1      A.   Well, the joint is under a lot of stress, and the 

 2  bone itself will start to deteriorate.  It will start to 

 3  wear, as far as the actual cartilage on the bone surfaces.  

 4  There is about 2 millimeters of cartilage on the surface, 

 5  and that will just start to wear away over time.

 6      Q.   And with regard to Ms. Pfaff, one of her 

 7  diagnoses from her operating surgeon is that glenohumeral 

 8  arthritis.  Have I pronounced that correctly?  

 9      A.   Exactly, yes.

10      Q.   Can you tell me what that is?

11      A.   Well, the glenoid, as I said, is the actual 

12  socket, and the humeral designation is the head, so that 

13  forms a joint called the glenohumeral joint.

14      Q.   And if someone has arthritis in that area, are 

15  they generally still able to function?

16      A.   Pretty much so, yes, because it's shallow and 

17  you're relying on muscles.  You don't have weight-bearing 

18  like you do in the hip and knee and even in the ankles 

19  which you rarely see arthritis as well, but hip and knee 

20  you see a lot of arthritis because there is a constant 

21  grinding of those surfaces, even though there is materials 

22  in between.  For the knee it's the meniscus.  For the hip 

23  it's a structure also called the labrum, so similar to 

24  what we see in the shoulder.  So the shoulder takes more 

25  time to develop this arthritic condition than those other 


                                                               35

 1  joints in the body.

 2      Q.   And with regard to trauma with someone who has 

 3  glenohumeral arthritis, how can trauma affect that?

 4      A.   Well, trauma will cause the structures that are 

 5  also interposed between the bones -- there is synovial 

 6  lining, for instance.  There is the capsule.  Everything 

 7  starts to become inflamed, and we call that inflammatory 

 8  disease.  That is what arthritis is.  It becomes an issue 

 9  because the nerve fibers and the structures that are 

10  supplied by nerves will start to send signals to the brain 

11  that there is pain there.  So ordinarily it's not a 

12  problem.  She may have periods of time where she needs 

13  some treatment for the arthritis, but generally it's not 

14  the same as when you have trauma like this.  So when you 

15  have a contusion, a traumatic head into the socket kind of 

16  thing from force, that becomes -- the arthritis becomes 

17  inflamed and that's what causes pain.

18      Q.   And we know in Ms. Pfaff's situation she ended up 

19  having surgery.  In your medical opinion was the 

20  replacement of both of these surgeries caused by this 

21  accident?  

22      A.   There is no question, yes, the need for the 

23  surgeries was precipitated by the accident-related 

24  injuries, yes.

25      Q.   Is this the straw that broke the camel's back 


                                                               36

 1  type of situation?

 2      A.   Absolutely, yes.  

 3      Q.   Okay.  Can you explain to the jury what she had 

 4  done?

 5      A.   Well, basically, what she had done is a surgery 

 6  that entails obviously going to the operating room, 

 7  placing the person under anesthesia.  Sometimes we do a 

 8  spleen block which is the muscles here.  There is a nerve 

 9  under there that the anesthesiologists can actually knock 

10  out, so to speak, and allow for us to work in that area.  

11           So basically an incision is made most of the time 

12  up-front.  The skin in what we call the subcutaneous 

13  tissue is placed aside by retracting it.  There is a large 

14  vein there that you have to protect, so you place that 

15  under the retractors, and then pretty much you are at the 

16  capsule.  You cut the capsule and you can release the 

17  first tendon of the rotator cuff which is the 

18  supraspinatus, and that allows you to start making the 

19  cuts in the bone.  So you are actually cutting the head 

20  off of the bone that we call the humeral head.  

21           The implant that will go into the canal of the 

22  bone has a stem on it and it has a head that will simulate 

23  the head of the humerus.  So the process of taking the 

24  medullary canal out, that is the internal table of the 

25  bone, is done by reaming.  We have reamers that start in 


                                                               37

 1  small diameter, and you work your way up until you get a 

 2  good internal bone mantel to in most places place cement.  

 3  The cement will hold the stem in, and then you position 

 4  the head to that socket.  You then repair the structures 

 5  back to the flange that's on this implant device, and then 

 6  you start the process of sewing inner layers out to the 

 7  skin which we'll clip with skin clips usually and then put 

 8  the dressings on.

 9      Q.   And to get into the medical name of what she had 

10  done I understand is a bilateral arthroplasty.  What does 

11  that describe?  

12      A.   Right.  It's just describing a total joint -- a 

13  partial joint replacement.  You can also replace the 

14  socket.  Sometimes we choose not to.  It's up to the 

15  surgeon.  There is a plastic piece that will be an extra 

16  part of the procedure where you punch a slot.  It has a 

17  flange on it as well.  You cement that in as well, and the 

18  head rather than have metal against the actual cartilage 

19  that's already damaged, you're replacing that cartilage.  

20  So you are creating a new head and socket, basically.

21           MR. LANG:  I'm going to move to strike the 

22  doctor's testimony, because it's talking in generalities 

23  as opposed to what actually happened to Mrs. Pfaff.

24  BY MR. FLAHERTY:

25      Q.   Is this the procedure that Mrs. Pfaff had done?


                                                               38

 1      A.   It is the procedure, yes.

 2      Q.   And Doctor, one of the other notes on the 

 3  procedure was biceps tenodesis bilaterally.  What does 

 4  that describe?

 5      A.   Well, there is two heads of the biceps.  In her 

 6  case the long head was outside of the groove that it 

 7  usually sits in.  So when you make a muscle and you pull 

 8  your arm up and tighten, her tendon was not sitting where 

 9  it's supposed to.  So the tenodesis is just a 

10  stabilization procedure for the biceps so that again the 

11  tendon will ride in the groove where it's supposed to be 

12  anatomically, and the person will have better function in 

13  the biceps.

14      Q.   What does that tendon have to do with the 

15  shoulder?

16      A.   That tendon actually goes into the shoulder and 

17  the top part of the labrum at the 12 o'clock position.  It 

18  actually inserts into the labrum.  So it's in the joint 

19  itself.  The other small head inserts in the small bone 

20  that's underneath the clavicle.  That is called the 

21  coracoid.  So these two tendons are -- at least the one, 

22  let's say, the long one, is absolutely related to function 

23  of the joint itself.

24      Q.   And the final part of the triple procedure was 

25  capsule release.  What does that mean?


                                                               39

 1      A.   Right.  So I talked about the joint being 

 2  surrounded by a capsule.  That stabilizes the head.  In 

 3  injury the capsule becomes laxed, so you're basically 

 4  going to sew it.  In my case I used to use a hot thermal 

 5  wand to do that, and I would place the wand, kind of like 

 6  putting an iron against a piece of clothing, but in this 

 7  case you are going to shrink the tissue.  So you can sew 

 8  it to shrink it by putting it on itself, folding it over 

 9  and sewing it in that position, or you can thermally do 

10  it.

11      Q.   And are these arthroscopic like through a portal, 

12  or are these open procedures?

13      A.   These are open procedures.  

14      Q.   And are her joints now in both shoulders, are 

15  those joints totally artificial?

16      A.   Yes, they are.

17      Q.   Is that hardware expected to remain in her 

18  shoulders?

19      A.   It's permanent, unless there is a complication.  

20  Then it has to be removed.  It will stay in there.  

21      Q.   And in Lillian's case why was such a drastic 

22  procedure needed instead of a simple scope?

23      A.   Well, the amount of arthritis, for one, the fact 

24  that in a person of this age, I believe she was 85 when 

25  this injury occurred, you are going to have to look ahead 


                                                               40

 1  a little bit and be a little smart in looking at the 

 2  structure of the tissues.  So it's just a technical piece 

 3  of information about how the surgery is approached, but it 

 4  will give the person a better mechanical advantage doing 

 5  it this way.  That's really what it's about, getting 

 6  function back.

 7      Q.   And you told us already you conducted a physical 

 8  exam of Lillian Pfaff in October of 2018 when you saw her. 

 9  What did you find on your exam when it came to her 

10  shoulders?

11      A.   Well, just looking at the shoulders, the wounds 

12  were well-healed from the surgery that she had, and in 

13  looking at the motion, she had on the left 45 percent 

14  normal and on the right 55 percent normal.  So we have 

15  numbers that actually the AMA puts out that we use as the 

16  standard norms, and then we work off of those numbers no 

17  matter what age the person is, and then we determine the 

18  percent for the different planes of motion.  There are six 

19  of them here going forward, backward, internal, external, 

20  circumduction and extension.  So that's what we're basing 

21  those numbers on.  

22      Q.   And when someone has a reduced range of motion 

23  like that, what kind of daily activities or what kind of 

24  motions with their upper extremities and arms are 

25  impaired?


                                                               41

 1      A.   Well, just things like going in the refrigerator 

 2  and trying to get a gallon of milk out or a half gallon or 

 3  a quart, whatever it is, just that reaching motion, going 

 4  in a closet and getting something off of a hanger.  I 

 5  mean, just things that we do in our normal lives that are 

 6  now going to be altered because she doesn't have that full 

 7  range, and she actually recruits her scapula which is the 

 8  wing bone in the back to get the shoulder to do some kind 

 9  of motion, but it's not functional motion that we are 

10  talking about.

11      Q.   And when we are talking about a loss of range of 

12  motion, is this something where a patient, specifically 

13  Lillian, is it something where she'll stop because it 

14  hurts or mechanically it just doesn't do that anymore?

15      A.   It just doesn't do it anymore.  It's rare that 

16  you have pain because you replace those areas that were 

17  arthritic, so a certain degree of pain because there is 

18  adhesion, there is scar, and just the way this total joint 

19  works in this particular joint.  All of those factors are 

20  going to be an issue for a person that's trying to do 

21  activities.

22      Q.   And I do want to turn to the conclusion -- well, 

23  before we get there.  In your medical opinion did you find 

24  the reduction in her range of motion and the condition 

25  she's in now when you saw her in 2018, did you find that 


                                                               42

 1  that condition was permanent?

 2      A.   It definitely is, yes.  

 3      Q.   Okay.  Turning to the conclusion in your report, 

 4  could you please tell the jury what conclusion you came 

 5  to?

 6      A.   Well, as far as the conclusions, I talked about 

 7  the spinal column, the shoulder itself, and the need for 

 8  the surgeries.  And then she had chronic pain obviously 

 9  after and a decrease in her activities, so that factors in 

10  and diagnoses.

11      Q.   And what did you find to be the cause of those 

12  injuries and those diagnoses?

13      A.   Well, the motor vehicle accident of May 26, 2016 

14  is the reason that she underwent the surgeries and the 

15  reason that she has her post-op findings as well.

16      Q.   And using your experience, clinical training, 

17  your review of the records, and your examination of 

18  Lillian Pfaff, were you able to arrive at a prognosis for 

19  her?

20      A.   Yes.

21      Q.   What is that prognosis?

22      A.   I gave her a fair prognosis.  

23      Q.   What does that mean?

24      A.   Prognosis is a predictor of future issues that a 

25  person is going to have, based on statistics and 


                                                               43

 1  statistical analysis about this particular injury and what 

 2  this injury entails.  So we're kind of going to be able to 

 3  talk about what the person may need in the future, as far 

 4  as my role have to be talking about a reasonable degree of 

 5  medical certainty.  So just looking at these cases and in 

 6  particular Ms. Pfaff what happens in the future.

 7      Q.   And based on that prognosis, were you able to 

 8  come to an opinion as to whether or not she would require 

 9  future care and treatment?

10      A.   Yes.

11      Q.   And what did you conclude and recommend in that 

12  area?

13      A.   Well, Ms. Pfaff is a person who really falls 

14  under the pain management realm.  I don't think there is 

15  anymore surgery she's going to need, unless there is a 

16  complication or something happens to the implants or they 

17  loosen, become infected, that kind of thing, and I don't 

18  foresee that.  But really in order to have her continue to 

19  function, because she is an active person, mostly 

20  medications that I mentioned.  They're certainly helpful.

21      Q.   And could you just read through that for the 

22  jury, please? 

23      A.   I said palliative care, meaning not doing anymore 

24  surgery, utilizing medications, including but not limited 

25  to analgesics, anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants.  


                                                               44

 1  There are some fancier ones called membrane stabilizers 

 2  and even cream applications for the soft tissue areas, but 

 3  those would be the ones I would pick to use perhaps in 

 4  combination or just singularly.

 5      Q.   What are membrane stabilizers?

 6      A.   Membrane stabilizers are unique medications that 

 7  actually affect the joints.  So even though she's had a 

 8  joint replaced, there is still soft tissue around this 

 9  implant or implants, and what happens with those soft 

10  tissues is again they become inflamed.  So you can 

11  actually use these medications to reduce inflammation by 

12  not putting a needle in there with medication.  I wouldn't 

13  inject the joint, because that would cause higher risk for 

14  infection particularly.

15      Q.   And you've told us that you found the surgery was 

16  related to this accident.  Do you give that opinion to a 

17  reasonable degree of medical certainty?

18      A.   I do, yes.

19      Q.   Do you have an opinion as to the reasonableness 

20  and necessity of the care she's had to date?

21      A.   I would certainly characterize the care as being 

22  medically necessary, reasonable, and causally related, as 

23  I said.

24      Q.   And Doctor, you've reviewed the bills in this 

25  case; is that correct?


                                                               45

 1      A.   I did, yes.

 2      Q.   Did you find the charges charged for 

 3  this care to be usual and customary?

 4      A.   Yes.

 5      Q.   Thank you, Doctor.  Have you given us 

 6  all of your opinions to a reasonable degree of 

 7  medical certainty?

 8      A.   I have, yes.  Thank you.  

 9           MR. FLAHERTY:  Your witness, Mr. Lang.  

10                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

11  BY MR. LANG:

12      Q.   Doctor, do you have a file on Ms. Pfaff?

13      A.   No, I don't.

14      Q.   What's that down next to your foot 

15  there?

16      A.   I was going to show you my certificates.  

17  It just has my certificates and some information 

18  in there that would be on voir dire that I would 

19  answer.

20      Q.   I see.  So you don't have a file on the 

21  person that you examined for this litigation?

22      A.   Right.  I'm not a treating physician, so 

23  I'm not obligated to keep any records.  I'm not a 

24  physician that's formed a patient relationship, 

25  so I'm not obligated to keep any records, and we 


                                                               46

 1  don't have capacity to do that.  

 2      Q.   Okay.  I'm going to touch on something you just 

 3  mentioned here at the end of your direct testimony.  

 4  Medications that she'll need in the future.  She also 

 5  needed these same types of medications before; correct?

 6      A.   Yes, she did.

 7      Q.   Do you know anything about -- and I'm just going 

 8  to call her Lillian.  I don't think she'll mind.  Do you 

 9  know anything about Lillian's medical history since your 

10  examination of her?

11      A.   I don't know anything after I saw her.

12      Q.   So as you just said, you're not her treating 

13  doctor; correct?

14      A.   Yes.

15      Q.   You've not performed any surgery or performed any 

16  procedures on her; correct?

17      A.   Correct.

18      Q.   In fact, her surgeon was Dr. Phillips; is that 

19  correct?

20      A.   Yes.

21      Q.   Have you communicated at all with Dr. Phillips?

22      A.   Again I'm not a treating physician, so I would be 

23  violating her HIPAA rights to do that.  So, no, I did not.

24      Q.   Do you have any idea why Dr. Phillips is not 

25  testifying in this case?


                                                               47

 1      A.   I do not know.

 2      Q.   Now, you've seen Mrs. Pfaff once; correct?

 3      A.   Yes.

 4      Q.   And that was in your Pittsburgh office; right?

 5      A.   Yes, sir.  

 6      Q.   And when you saw her, she no longer had any neck 

 7  pain; correct? 

 8      A.   Yes.

 9      Q.   She told you that had resolved?

10      A.   Yes.

11      Q.   Did her neck -- or excuse me.  Did her back pain 

12  resolve as well?

13      A.   She didn't have any complaints, so I would say 

14  that would be fair to say.

15      Q.   All right.  And this was all by the time you had 

16  seen her; correct?  

17      A.   Right.  I examined her neck and back, and I will 

18  tell you that there were normal findings there.  So I 

19  don't think the spinal column is an issue totally.

20      Q.   So what we're really talking about here is her 

21  shoulders; correct? 

22      A.   Her shoulders, yes.

23      Q.   Would you agree with that?

24      A.   I would, yes.

25      Q.   All right.  Now, were you aware that Mrs. Pfaff 


                                                               48

 1  had a stroke in August of 2018 that left her paralyzed on 

 2  one side of her body for a period of time?

 3      A.   That part I was aware of, yes.  

 4      Q.   Okay.  So you did know that.  All right.  Would 

 5  you -- well, let me ask you.  You reviewed -- you said in 

 6  your report that you reviewed some medical records; 

 7  correct?  You actually have a section records reviewed?

 8      A.   Yes, I did.

 9      Q.   And you cite -- are these all of the records that 

10  you reviewed in this case?

11      A.   They would be all of it, yes. 

12      Q.   And the records you reviewed are a CT scan of the 

13  left shoulder with contrast, 3D reconstruction; correct?

14      A.   Correct.

15      Q.   That's one record?

16      A.   Yes.

17      Q.   Allegheny Health Network records; correct?

18      A.   Yes.

19      Q.   AHN Health information management report, 

20  February 14, 2018, is that the other record?

21      A.   Yes.

22      Q.   So those are the three sets of records that you 

23  reviewed?

24      A.   I have more than that in my document.

25      Q.   Okay.  Well, I'm looking at your October 24, 2018 


                                                               49

 1  report.  Maybe you can point to where you reviewed other 

 2  records.

 3      A.   Well, are you including the op summaries and all 

 4  of that?  I broke those out and the one that you 

 5  mentioned, I think the letters that you mentioned.

 6      Q.   Okay.  So you looked at Dr. Phillips' operative 

 7  summary?

 8      A.   For both the right and left shoulders, yes.

 9      Q.   And then records from Allegheny Orthopedics; 

10  correct? 

11      A.   Right.  That's correct.

12      Q.   And records from Orlandini Family Chiropractic?

13      A.   Yes.  That's correct.

14      Q.   And records from Villa Saint Joseph's of Badan 

15  when she was recovering?

16      A.   Right, and then the EMS and emergency facility 

17  records.  That would be it.  

18      Q.   Do you have any of those records with you?

19      A.   As I said, no, we don't keep the records.

20      Q.   And those are the records that were produced to 

21  you or given to you by Simon & Simon; is that correct?

22      A.   That is correct, yes.

23      Q.   Would you agree with me, having reviewed her 

24  medical history, that she has a very long and substantial 

25  medical history that predates the date of this accident?


                                                               50

 1      A.   Yeah.  I would think that's fair to say, yes. 

 2      Q.   I mean, her medical history includes stroke, 

 3  aneurism with clips, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery 

 4  disease, hypertension, upper and lower extremity weakness, 

 5  unsteady gait, depression, anxiety, congestive heart 

 6  failure, GERD, dizziness, seizures, heart attack, 

 7  hypothyroid.  She has a long history, doesn't she?

 8      A.   They're medical conditions.  She certainly does, 

 9  yes.

10           MR. FLAHERTY:  Objection to relevance with regard 

11  to the shoulder injury sustained in this accident.  There 

12  has been no testimony by any qualified medical physician 

13  that these injuries are contributing to the causation 

14  defense or the causation of this injury.

15  BY MR. LANG:

16      Q.   And she has something called Hemishoto's (sic) 

17  disease?

18      A.   Hashimoto's.

19      Q.   Hashimoto's disease.  What is that?

20      A.   Well, I think it's in the thyroid.

21      Q.   Okay.  And she takes a lot of medication; 

22  correct?

23      A.   Yes.

24      Q.   Including medications that you referenced 

25  earlier, pain medications, anti-inflammatories; correct?


                                                               51

 1      A.   Yes, I did.  

 2      Q.   Analgesics; correct?

 3      A.   You are correct.

 4      Q.   She took those before the date of this accident?

 5      A.   Yes, she did.

 6      Q.   All right.  She's been in and out of the hospital 

 7  too many times to count and has dozen of doctors; fair?

 8      A.   Yeah.  She's 85.  I don't find that to be 

 9  unusual, but that is fair.  

10           MR. FLAHERTY:  Same objection.

11  BY MR. LANG:

12      Q.   So are you claiming that despite all of this, her 

13  activities of daily living are diminished because solely 

14  of the shoulder injuries in this case, or do all of these 

15  other factors have a role in that?

16      A.   Well, when I presented the documents that speak 

17  to the issue of activities, particularly she was 

18  instructed just to give an idea of what is limited from 

19  the shoulder standpoint.  And when I saw her, it was the 

20  spinal column as well, but as far as any medical disease 

21  state, she should have not included those, and I don't 

22  think that she did, as far as I can tell from the review.

23      Q.   Maybe I didn't understand your answer.  Let me -- 

24  my question wasn't clear.  You're saying today that her 

25  shoulder injuries caused by this motor vehicle accident 


                                                               52

 1  have somehow affected her activities of daily living, her 

 2  day-to-day activities; correct?

 3      A.   I am indicating that and in particular when it 

 4  comes to shoulder girdle function, yes.  I'm not including 

 5  any medical disease states that may cause her to not be 

 6  able to do certain things, let's say, walk for distances.  

 7  If she has COPD or a lung condition, she's not going to be 

 8  able to do that.  That has nothing to do with the 

 9  shoulder, per se.

10      Q.   Okay.  But I'm talking about her overall clinical 

11  picture.  All of these other problems, these multiple 

12  problems that she has, they affect her activities of daily 

13  living as well; agree?  

14           MR. FLAHERTY:  Same objection.  

15      A.   Well, they certainly may, yes, just from the 

16  medical standpoint, but I particularly stuck to, and in 

17  talking with her and instructing her when she filled out 

18  the forms that she did, only talk about those areas that 

19  were injured in this motor vehicle accident, not her other 

20  conditions.

21      Q.   Okay.  And just touching once again on her neck 

22  pain, there was no MRI or x-rays relating to her neck or 

23  her back; is that correct?

24      A.   I believe you are correct, yes.

25      Q.   All right.  You would agree that Lillian has 


                                                               53

 1  severe glenohumeral and AC joint arthritis; correct?

 2      A.   She did before the surgeries, yes.  

 3      Q.   Yeah.  And she -- and with synovitis.  What is 

 4  synovitis?

 5      A.   As I said, there is a lining of the joint called 

 6  the synovium.  It produces fluid to kind of lubricate the 

 7  joints.  So when it's inflamed, anything that is an itis 

 8  that's attached to it will be inflammation related.

 9      Q.   And this -- and this was categorized by her 

10  surgeon, Dr. Phillips, as severe; correct?  

11      A.   That is correct.

12      Q.   All right.  And his preoperative procedure -- and 

13  this was on both shoulders; correct?

14      A.   Yes, you are correct.

15      Q.   His preoperative diagnosis was glenohumeral 

16  arthritis on both right and left; correct?  

17      A.   You are correct, yes.

18      Q.   And his operation was to try to alleviate the 

19  problems caused by that arthritis; correct?

20      A.   In part, because, as I said, in my testimony 

21  earlier, arthritis in and of itself doesn't necessarily 

22  cause problems.  I agree that she had a history before 

23  that of some complaints about the shoulder.  In the two 

24  years before that where she did present to her treating 

25  physician nobody ever talked about surgery, and I didn't 


                                                               54

 1  see any recommendations for it.  So she didn't need 

 2  surgery until this accident occurred.

 3      Q.   All right.  So, sir, in your opinion surgery 

 4  wasn't inevitable.  She wasn't going to have the 

 5  surgery -- 

 6      A.   I would say generally no.

 7      Q.   -- absent the motor vehicle accident?  

 8      A.   Even with the history of arthritis for which she 

 9  may have had some treatments, nothing like what happened 

10  after this motor vehicle accident, and as counsel asked me 

11  in the beginning, it's the straw that broke the camel's 

12  back, basically.

13      Q.   And so your opinion is that since these 

14  preexisting conditions were quiescent prior to the motor 

15  vehicle accident, her complaints after the motor vehicle 

16  accident were because of the motor vehicle accident; is 

17  that correct?

18      A.   I think that summarizes it quite well.  Thank 

19  you.  Yes.

20      Q.   What do you mean by quiescent exactly?

21      A.   Well, it's not making the person have to go to a 

22  doctor and do what she did with Dr. Phillips.  In other 

23  words, she goes to a doctor who is going to give her some 

24  medication.  She limits her activities and then she's back 

25  to doing what she was doing.  She was actually working.  


                                                               55

 1  So after the accident she's not working.  So all of these 

 2  factors relate to what happened in the accident itself 

 3  affecting what we already acknowledge is there.  

 4      Q.   Now, we -- so, in fact, if she had complaints of 

 5  prior shoulder problems, you would change your opinion 

 6  that her complaints were not -- her issues were not 

 7  quiescent?

 8      A.   They were quiescent before this accident 

 9  happened.  I'm saying in her history she had periods of 

10  time where she presented for her shoulder.  So we are not 

11  hiding that fact.  It's there, but again nobody that I'm 

12  aware of made any recommendations for surgery before this 

13  incident occurred.  Subsequent to this, she needed the 

14  surgery.  

15      Q.   And when you are forming your opinions, it's 

16  important to have a complete clinical picture which would 

17  include all of the prior medical records; correct?

18      A.   Not necessarily, no.

19      Q.   No?

20      A.   I don't subscribe to that, no, not at all.

21      Q.   Okay.  So it doesn't matter to you what medical 

22  records that would exist prior to the date of the 

23  accident?

24      A.   Well, I qualify that.  What I'm saying is if 

25  there is something similar to the same as and we have 


                                                               56

 1  comparative information, then it might mean something to 

 2  me.  But again presenting for a simple shoulder complaint 

 3  and getting treated for it is not the same as what 

 4  transpired here.  And if I see any records that would lead 

 5  me elsewhere, I would certainly be willing to change my 

 6  opinion, I guess.

 7      Q.   All right.  I see that you did not have an 

 8  opportunity to look at any records from Tejan Chiropractic 

 9  where she treated; correct?

10      A.   That's correct.

11      Q.   I'm going to show you what I have marked as 

12  Defendant's Exhibit C.  These are records from Tejan 

13  Chiropractic.  The date on this record is March 17, 2016.  

14  She's complaining of severe pain in both shoulders, isn't 

15  she?

16           (Defendant's Exhibit C was marked for 

17  identification.)

18      A.   Well, I haven't seen this before, so if I could 

19  get a chance, I would appreciate it.

20      Q.   Okay.  Well, that's one of the problems, I guess.

21      A.   Well, it's not a problem until you let me look at 

22  it, and then if it is a problem, I'll say so.  Okay.

23      Q.   Okay.  You've had an -- may I see that for a 

24  moment, Doctor?

25      A.   Yes.  Thanks.


                                                               57

 1      Q.   Would you agree with me that the record is dated 

 2  March 17, 2016; correct?

 3      A.   Yes, I would.

 4      Q.   That's just a couple of months before this 

 5  accident?

 6      A.   You are correct.

 7      Q.   And the record refers to pain in low back and 

 8  both shoulders and neck, both sides, and she drew on here 

 9  X's noting pain in her shoulders and her low back; 

10  correct?  

11      A.   You are correct, yes. 

12      Q.   And she circled unbearable pain.  On a pain scale 

13  of 0 to 10, she circled 9 and 10; correct?

14      A.   Yes.

15      Q.   And it says sometimes interrupts my sleep, 

16  restless legs going into spasms.  So would you agree with 

17  me that she was just a couple of months before this 

18  accident she was having severe pain in both shoulders?

19      A.   I would not disagree with you, and she went to a 

20  chiropractor for treatment for that.  

21      Q.   Okay.  Let me show you another record, Doctor. 

22  This is from Dr. Phillips that I've marked as Defendant's 

23  Exhibit D.  I assume you've seen this record?

24           (Defendant's Exhibit D was marked for 

25  identification.)


                                                               58

 1      A.   Yes; I believe I have.  

 2           MR. FLAHERTY:  What date are we talking about, 

 3  Mike?  Thank you.

 4  BY MR. LANG:

 5      Q.   May I see that, Doctor.  This is a progress note, 

 6  January 5, 2017; correct?  

 7      A.   I have to look at it again.  Thanks.

 8      Q.   Sure.

 9      A.   Correct.

10      Q.   And in that he says that she has had pain for 

11  years in both shoulders; correct?

12      A.   Yes.

13      Q.   So again that would be important information for 

14  you to know; correct?

15      A.   Well, we've already known that.  As I said, it's 

16  not a secret that she had pain.  We acknowledged that she 

17  had pain.  Again that's all I'll say on that issue.  It's 

18  not anything that is unusual in the big picture here.

19      Q.   But this is her own surgeon, the man who did the 

20  shoulder surgery, Dr. Phillips, saying that she has had 

21  pain for years in both shoulders; correct?

22      A.   That's exactly correct, yes.

23           THE WITNESS:  Would you mind if I replenish this 

24  for a couple of minutes?

25           MR. FLAHERTY:  Off the record, please.  


                                                               59

 1           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:05 a.m.  We are 

 2  going off the video record.

 3           (Short recess taken.)

 4           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:06 a.m.  We are 

 5  now back on the video record.

 6  BY MR. LANG:

 7      Q.   Doctor, one of the records that you didn't review 

 8  was the EMS report; is that correct?

 9      A.   Yes.

10      Q.   Along with the ER records; correct?

11      A.   Yes.

12      Q.   And I'm going to show you what I have marked as 

13  Defendant's Exhibit E.  

14           (Defendant's Exhibit E was marked for 

15  identification.)

16      A.   Thanks.

17      Q.   This is the EMS report.  There's actually 

18  ironically there is two copies.  I'm going to mark them 

19  both as Exhibit E.  Would you agree with me that there 

20  were no complaints of any shoulder problems, injuries, 

21  pain, from the -- to the paramedics on the date of the 

22  accident?

23      A.   I believe you are correct, yes. 

24      Q.   Okay.  Was there any noted -- was there any 

25  bruising noted?  You said she had bruising of her 


                                                               60

 1  shoulders.  Where did you get that information from?  Is 

 2  that something she told you, or was that from a record?

 3      A.   I don't think in my testimony I said she had 

 4  bruising.  I said she had well-healed --

 5      Q.   You said contusions.

 6      A.   Oh, yeah, I said contusions, yes. 

 7      Q.   Okay.  Where did you get the information that she 

 8  had contusions to her shoulders?

 9      A.   Well, when she had talked to me about the 

10  incident, she said she was struck several times by the 

11  same vehicle.  She was thrown forward and she was wearing 

12  her seat belt.  Her head hit the steering wheel.  From 

13  that I indicated that that would be a contusion, 

14  particularly when the belt is coming across the shoulder 

15  on that side.

16      Q.   Okay.  But you didn't see anything in the records 

17  of the physicians at the emergency room noting contusions?

18      A.    I think that's fair.  I don't believe they 

19  characterize it and they certainly didn't in the EMS 

20  record here.  

21      Q.   And there were no complaints of any shoulder 

22  injuries in the EMS record?

23      A.   That's correct, yes. 

24      Q.   All right.  Now, let's look at the emergency room 

25  record from the date of the accident.  I'm going to show 


                                                               61

 1  you what I've marked as Defendant Exhibit F.  Take a look 

 2  at that, Doctor.  That's from the date of the accident?  

 3           (Defendant's Exhibit F was marked for 

 4  identification.)

 5      A.   Yes.

 6      Q.   Again no complaints relative to her shoulders; 

 7  correct?

 8      A.   Yes.  

 9      Q.   And you -- and you've looked at this record.  

10  They didn't even x-ray her shoulders, did they?

11      A.   They did not.  That's correct.

12      Q.   I'll show you the radiology results.  They 

13  x-rayed her right knee which was negative; correct?  

14      A.   Yes.

15      Q.   May I see those, Doctor, please?

16      A.   Yes.

17      Q.   And the impression at the emergency room was head 

18  injury, neck strain, right knee contusion; correct?

19      A.   That's correct.

20      Q.   And she was stable at discharge; correct?  

21      A.   Yes.

22      Q.   You are aware that Mrs. Pfaff fell on January 23, 

23  2018, causing shoulder pain; is that correct?  Were you 

24  aware of that?

25      A.   That one I wasn't aware of, I don't think.


                                                               62

 1      Q.   All right.  Let me show you that.

 2           MR. FLAHERTY:  Same objection as previous.  

 3  There's been no testimony that this fall caused any 

 4  exacerbation or intervening cause with regard to the 

 5  injuries claimed.  It's irrelevant.  

 6  BY MR. LANG:

 7      Q.   This is from again Allegheny Health Network that 

 8  refers to her fall; is that correct, Allegheny General 

 9  Hospital?  

10           (Defendant's Exhibit G was marked for 

11  identification.)

12      A.   I have to get familiar with this one if you don't 

13  mind.  Yes.  She talked about her left shoulder here.  

14      Q.   Yes.  So if she injured her left shoulder in that 

15  fall, you can't relate the shoulder complaints when she 

16  saw -- to the motor vehicle accident when she saw you, 

17  correct, her continuing complaints?  

18           MR. FLAHERTY:  Same objection.

19  BY MR. LANG:

20      Q.   In other words, she had her motor vehicle 

21  accident, she had her fall, she saw you.  So any 

22  complaints about her left shoulder you don't know if 

23  they're from the motor vehicle accident or from this fall, 

24  do you?

25      A.   Well, I do because the history is in there that 


                                                               63

 1  she already knew she was getting a shoulder replacement.  

 2  So there is no elaboration on the history, but obviously 

 3  this came after.  So anything that transpired before with 

 4  her treating surgeon was already decided.

 5      Q.   And you've not seen any of these records in 

 6  preparing your report and your testimony today, other than 

 7  the emergency room and the paramedics records; correct?  

 8      A.   Right, but so far what I have seen again wouldn't 

 9  change my opinion.

10      Q.   I wouldn't expect it to, Doctor.

11           But the fact that you said that her preexisting 

12  shoulder problems were quiescent, that's not true, is it?

13      A.   I went by her history, and I still think that the 

14  history is accurate.  If she had periods again where she 

15  had increased pain because of, let's say, a fall, that 

16  certainly isn't again the same as what was already 

17  exacerbated by the motor vehicle accident.  In other 

18  words, this is just something on top of what already was.

19      Q.   Well, when she complained just a couple of months 

20  to the chiropractor of severe shoulder pain in both 

21  shoulders, that would be the antithesis of quiescent, 

22  wouldn't it?

23      A.   Well, I wouldn't disagree if she presented with 

24  that complaint, but again the issue is again in regard to 

25  trauma, what is precipitating trauma.  She didn't go 


                                                               64

 1  anywhere else.  She didn't have any surgical opinions 

 2  provided.  She went to a chiropractor, and I don't think 

 3  there is anything else afterwards, unless you are going to 

 4  show it to me that again would be similar to as the same 

 5  as what transpired after the motor vehicle accident.  So 

 6  again I would respectfully say I'm not going to change my 

 7  opinions.

 8      Q.   And you've seen nothing from -- in Dr. Phillips' 

 9  records where he says the motor vehicle accident 

10  necessitated his shoulder surgery, did he?  In fact, his 

11  preoperative diagnosis was arthritis.  

12           MR. FLAHERTY:  Well, I'm going to object.  

13  Exhibit B is completely counter to that.  In fact, 

14  Dr. Phillips indicates that he -- the accident caused the 

15  exacerbation, the one you just showed the doctor.  So if 

16  you could put B back in front of him so he could respond 

17  to that question.

18           MR. LANG:  Exhibit B is Dr. Yarus' interrogatory 

19  answers.  

20           MR. FLAHERTY:  I'm sorry.  Dr. Phillips' 

21  follow-up from January 2017.  I thought it was B.

22  BY MR. LANG:

23      Q.   Doctor, do you think it would have been 

24  beneficial for you to have these other prior records to 

25  review when preparing your report and conclusions?


                                                               65

 1      A.   The ones that you showed me today?

 2      Q.   Yes, sir.  

 3      A.   Again respectfully I would say that it would not 

 4  change my opinion, and again Dr. Phillips actually for the 

 5  history indicated this specific injury was the motor 

 6  vehicle accident, May 26, 2016, and he referenced that in 

 7  regard to her shoulder pain that was there for three 

 8  weeks.

 9      Q.   Dr. Phillips wrote in his note, "Patient is 

10  85-year-old female with long history of bilateral shoulder 

11  pain, left greater than right.  She has had pain for years 

12  which was exacerbated after a motor vehicle accident of 

13  May 2017.  She went through a course of therapy over the 

14  summer without significant relief.  She presents to this 

15  office today to discuss her options for her left 

16  shoulder."

17            He doesn't attribute the motor vehicle accident 

18  to the necessity of the shoulder surgery, does he?  He 

19  just says that the motor vehicle exacerbated her 

20  long-standing shoulder problems.

21      A.   Well, I would say you can draw the conclusion 

22  from that.  There is nothing else again in the records you 

23  showed me that leads to that decision-making process.  So 

24  again respectfully I would say it doesn't specifically say 

25  that, but it certainly indicates that that decision was 


                                                               66

 1  made on the basis of that accident.

 2      Q.   If she had sustained a shoulder injury in the 

 3  motor vehicle accident, wouldn't you have expected it to 

 4  show up in the paramedics report or the ER record, at 

 5  least they would have looked at it if she had any 

 6  complaints?

 7      A.   Not at all.  She was confused, for one.  She was 

 8  in a traumatic event, and when you read these kind of 

 9  documents, it is so common not to have every single injury 

10  that may have occurred listed.  Those guys are trained to 

11  get people away and into an emergency setting so they 

12  could be evaluated.  It's about life and death.  So I 

13  don't think a shoulder injury, per se, is going to 

14  manifest or be talked about when you have somebody who has 

15  had multiple trauma.

16      Q.   Well, they x-rayed her knees because she 

17  complained of knee pain.  They looked at her neck and back 

18  because she complained of neck and back pain; right?

19      A.   Yeah.  That doesn't mean it wasn't there.

20      Q.   If she would have complained of shoulder pain, 

21  they would have looked at it; right?

22      A.   That's cockeyed logic.  Again this person has 

23  multifactor injuries.  She was confused.  She had a head 

24  injury, obviously.  So I wouldn't expect anything, except 

25  for what's documented that occurred at that time.


                                                               67

 1      Q.   Let's go back to your comment that I'm using 

 2  cockeyed logic.  So you are saying that if she would have 

 3  complained of shoulder pain, they wouldn't have looked at 

 4  it?  Let's talk about your cockeyed logic for a second.  

 5           MR. FLAHERTY:  Objection.  Argumentative.  You 

 6  can answer.  

 7      A.   Again when you read emergency records like this, 

 8  EMS and emergency facility records, a person who has 

 9  multiple trauma, multiple areas of injury won't 

10  necessarily complain of a particular area.  It may not 

11  manifest until later on as well.  And here is a person who 

12  had arthritis and doesn't complain about it.  So again it 

13  may have been quiet at that point in time.  It may not 

14  have manifested.  I don't know.  I can only just say in 

15  regard to the documentation, it isn't there, but that 

16  doesn't mean it didn't get injured.

17      Q.   Well, wait a second.  Now you said she didn't 

18  complain about it.  Two months before the accident or in 

19  March of 2016, three months before the accident, she's 

20  complaining significantly to her chiropractor; right?

21      A.   Well, we were specifically talking about the 

22  documents that you showed me, the EMS document and the ER 

23  document.  We are not talking about what transpired 

24  before, as far as I understand your question.

25      Q.   All right.  Well, let's kind of try to bring this 


                                                               68

 1  back around to a logical conclusion.  If she would have 

 2  complained of shoulder pain in the emergency room or to 

 3  the paramedics, they would have examined those areas of 

 4  her bodies and given her appropriate treatment; correct?

 5      A.   They may have.  I can't speak for what was in the 

 6  mind or how a paramedic is going to act on the scene. 

 7  Again multiple trauma, elderly person.  We are not going 

 8  to sit there evaluating them all day.  She told them what 

 9  was bothering her at the time.  I accept that, but that 

10  doesn't mean that the shoulders were not injured, as I 

11  said.

12      Q.   Well, since she was an elderly patient, wouldn't 

13  they be more concerned that she would have, for example, 

14  brittle bones or be more susceptible to injury and they 

15  would be more careful in evaluating her; correct?

16           MR. FLAHERTY:  Objection.  Speculation.  

17           MR. LANG:  Well, the doctor has been talking 

18  about her being confused, so he can speculate about this 

19  too.

20           THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm not speculating.  I have 

21  been doing this for 35 years, and I can tell you that on 

22  scenes like that again whatever was documented was what 

23  she was responding to at the time.  I can only speak to 

24  what's in the record.  I can't speak to what may or may 

25  not have been.  


                                                               69

 1           Suffice it to say that when she got to 

 2  Dr. Phillips, that was the issue, as far as the motor 

 3  vehicle accident causing her symptoms.

 4  BY MR. LANG:

 5      Q.   Right.  And what's not in the record, in the 

 6  emergency room record, are complaints of shoulder pain; 

 7  correct?

 8      A.   Counsel, I'll agree to that, it's not in the 

 9  records, not documented as being part of her complaints, 

10  but that is where it ends.  It doesn't mean anything until 

11  we get to the next part of her evaluation and somebody who 

12  is going to focus in on where she's complaining.

13      Q.   And it's not part of her diagnosis at the 

14  emergency room?

15      A.   I agree to that as well.

16      Q.   And there is nothing in the emergency room record 

17  that would indicate she was in any way confused or having 

18  difficulty interacting with the emergency room personnel, 

19  is there?

20      A.   In the ER document I have to look at it again.  I 

21  don't recall.

22      Q.   You would agree with me that sometimes when 

23  people are confused, they note that in the record, 

24  confused, not a good historian, those kinds of things; 

25  correct?


                                                               70

 1      A.   Well, here it talks about her saying that she 

 2  thinks the guy hit her was a little confused, maybe the 

 3  person that hit her.  Okay.  And then he hit her again.  

 4  As far as her being confused, I'll agree to that.  

 5           MR. LANG:  Okay.  That's all I have.  Thank you, 

 6  Doctor.

 7           THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.  Thanks.

 8           MR. LANG:  I don't have any other questions.  

 9           MR. FLAHERTY:  All right.  Doctor, just some 

10  brief follow-up. 

11                           -----

12                    REDIRECT EXAMINATION

13  BY MR. FLAHERTY:

14      Q.   There was some questioning earlier about your 

15  knowledge of what happened to Ms. Pfaff after this 

16  accident, and the fact that she had a stroke, she had 

17  some cardiac issues.  There is no secret that that's 

18  going to come out in testimony of Ms. Pfaff.  Does the 

19  fact that she had a stroke have any bearing on the 

20  healing or recuperation of motion for her shoulder 

21  problems?

22      A.   Overall I would say no.  It doesn't seem to be. 

23  Actually the residuals from the stroke were characterized 

24  as resolved.  So I would say she was functional again 

25  after that.


                                                               71

 1      Q.   And I anticipate there is going to be some 

 2  testimony, depending on how the court rules, on whether or 

 3  not upon her fall that she sustained in 2018 -- in fact, 

 4  from the records that Mr. Lang had shown you surgery was 

 5  already scheduled for the shoulders before that fall; is 

 6  that correct?

 7      A.   Right.  That's what I said.  This was in January 

 8  of 2018.  Certainly this occurred before that.

 9      Q.   And you had mentioned this earlier on cross, but 

10  you had Lillian Pfaff fill out a form of her activities 

11  that were impaired by this accident; is that correct?

12      A.   That's correct, yes.

13           MR. LANG:  Objection.  This is beyond the scope 

14  of cross.  

15           MR. FLAHERTY:  It was on counsel's question in 

16  response.  

17  BY MR. FLAHERTY:

18      Q.   I would like you to just look at that form, and I 

19  have it pulled out for you.  And correct me if I'm wrong, 

20  but you had directed her to indicate which activities were 

21  affected by these injuries; correct?

22      A.   Exactly, yes.

23      Q.   And you could -- I know there is a lot of things 

24  there.  But could you tell the jury what she marked off as 

25  have being impaired?


                                                               72

 1      A.   She marked sewing, dancing, flea 

 2  marketing, antique shows, going to a parade.

 3      Q.   Is there anything on the subsequent 

 4  page?

 5      A.   Under cleaning, changing the bed, 

 6  ironing, cleaning windows, vacuuming, cleaning 

 7  floors, sweeping, mowing grass, weeding, planting 

 8  flowers, digging, shoveling, washing the car, 

 9  cutting finger and toe nails.  Physical 

10  functions, standing, squatting, standing on one 

11  foot, bending over.

12      Q.   And as a physician, are these activities 

13  that you'll see in, say, therapy records that are 

14  qualified as activities of daily living, ADLs? 

15      A.   Right.  In therapy records you'll see 

16  this kind of documentation, yes.  

17           MR. FLAHERTY:  Okay.  I don't have 

18  anything further for you, Doctor.  Thank you for 

19  your time today.

20           THE WITNESS:  Thank you.  You're 

21  welcome.  

22               RECROSS-EXAMINATION 

23  BY MR. LANG:

24      Q.   Doctor, looking at that pain and 

25  disability questionnaire, the first page of it, 


                                                               73

 1  the first category after the introductry (sic) -- 

 2  introductory paragraph says neck and/or low back pain and 

 3  impairment disability indices; correct?  

 4      A.   Yes.

 5      Q.   And in Item No. 2 she marked off I can look after 

 6  myself normally, but it causes extra pain; correct?

 7      A.   Yes, she did.

 8      Q.   And then under work she says I can hardly do any 

 9  work at all; correct?

10      A.   Yes.

11      Q.   And then she under driving she says I can drive 

12  my car as long as I want with slight pain in my neck 

13  and/or low back; correct?

14      A.   Yes.

15      Q.   And then she talks about I can hardly do any 

16  recreational activities because of my pain in my neck 

17  and/or back; correct?

18      A.   Yes.

19      Q.   She said I cannot walk at all without increasing 

20  pain; correct?

21      A.   Yes.

22      Q.   That wouldn't have anything to do with her 

23  shoulder, would it? 

24      A.   These are back and neck, yes. 

25      Q.   These are all back and neck complaints; right?


                                                               74

 1      A.   They are.

 2      Q.   Sitting, pain movement -- pain prevents me from 

 3  sitting more than a half an hour; correct?

 4      A.   Correct.

 5      Q.   Standing, I cannot stand for longer than ten 

 6  minutes without increasing pain; correct?

 7      A.   Yes.

 8      Q.   Social activities, pain has restricted my social 

 9  life, and I do not go out very often; right?

10      A.   Yes.

11      Q.   Traveling, I get extra pain when traveling which 

12  compels me to seek alternative forms of travel; correct?

13      A.   Yes.

14      Q.   This is all back and neck?

15      A.   This is document specific to that, yes.

16      Q.   Yeah.  She says my pain is neither getting better 

17  nor worse; correct?

18      A.   Yes.

19      Q.   And then under another subheading back pain 

20  disability questionnaire, I change positions frequently to 

21  try to get my pain reduced; right?

22      A.   Yes.

23      Q.   Because of my pain, I am not doing any jobs that 

24  I usually do around the home; correct?

25      A.   Yes.


                                                               75

 1      Q.   I only stand up for short periods of time because 

 2  of my pain; correct?

 3      A.   That's correct.

 4      Q.   I avoid heavy jobs around the home because of my 

 5  pain; correct?  

 6      A.   Correct.

 7      Q.   And again that's all related only to her back and 

 8  neck?  

 9      A.   This was a component of what she had in the 

10  accident, and I characterize this as soft tissue, that's 

11  correct.

12      Q.   In which you said were healed by the time she saw 

13  you?

14      A.   Neck pain was resolved, yes. 

15      Q.   Well, you told me earlier the back pain as well; 

16  correct?

17      A.   All of those three areas I'll stipulate to that, 

18  yes. 

19      Q.   And this other section, the last few pages that 

20  Attorney Flaherty was referring to, again this is just 

21  generic things that she can't do.  It doesn't say anything 

22  about specifically to her shoulder, does it?

23      A.   As I said, the instructions were anything that 

24  occurred in the accident that you could do, as far as 

25  activities that you did before that you can't do now 


                                                               76

 1  specifically because of this accident of May 26, 2016.  

 2  That's the instructions that are given.  

 3           MR. LANG:  Those are all of the questions I 

 4  have.  Thank you.  

 5           THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.  Thanks.

 6           MR. FLAHERTY:  Thank you, Doctor.  Nothing 

 7  further. 

 8           THE WITNESS:  You're welcome.  Thank you.  

 9           THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 11:25 a.m.  This 

10  concludes this video deposition. 

11           (Signature waived.)

13  concluded at 11:25 a.m. this date.)

           8     first duly cautioned and sworn or affirmed by

           9     BRENDA J. O'CONNOR-MARELLO, a Certified

          10     Shorthand Reporter and Notary Public in and for

          11     the State of New York, Qualified in Saratoga

          12     County, herein to tell the truth, the whole

          13     truth, and nothing but the truth, was examined

          14     and testified as follows:

          15                       EXAMINATION

          16     BY MR. MILLER:

          17     Q.  Good morning, Doctor.

          18     A.  Good morning.

          19     Q.  Can you tell me if you reviewed any

          20         documents in preparation for giving

          21         testimony here today?

          22     A.  Yes.

          23     Q.  Please tell me what documents you

          24         reviewed.

          25     A.  I reviewed our report on the material that

                                                                5



           1         we received with respect to this case, and

           2         also I briefly looked at another report on

           3         the cytogenetics.

           4                   MR. MILLER:  Do you have those

           5             reports?

           6                   MR. BELL:  Yeah.  I'll have you

           7             mark them.  There's cytogenics and

           8             there's reports.

           9                   MR. MILLER:  I may have them in

          10             my material, but...

          11     BY MR. MILLER:

          12     Q.  So you reviewed only those two documents?

          13     A.  Right.

          14     Q.  To prepare for your testimony here today,

          15         did you conduct any type of investigation

          16         or interview or speak with anybody in the

          17         Department of Pathology or Anatomic

          18         Pathology?

          19     A.  In preparation for this testimony, I did

          20         not.

          21     Q.  Are you aware of any investigation that

          22         was conducted by Albany Medical Center in

          23         connection with this matter?

          24     A.  Yes.

          25     Q.  And please tell me what investigation you

                                                                6



           1         are aware of.

           2                   MR. BELL:  Objection to the

           3             form, but go ahead.

           4     A.  Once I was made aware of this, I was

           5         involved in the investigations that ensued

           6         with respect to this that included a root

           7         cause analysis.

           8     Q.  All right.  When you say you were involved

           9         in the investigation with this, what does

          10         "this" mean?

          11     A.  Well, we had handled this material, this,

          12         what we call it, a specimen, in our

          13         laboratory, and handled it in a routine

          14         fashion rather than handling it with the

          15         special request that was made.  So there

          16         was an error in our laboratory in not

          17         holding the specimen for purposes of

          18         burial, as I understood it.  So that was

          19         the issue at hand that we investigated.

          20     Q.  Tell me what the investigation consisted

          21         of, to your knowledge.

          22                   MR. BELL:  Again, objection, but

          23             you can answer.

          24     A.  As I say, we had a preliminary inquiry

          25         into whether we still had the specimen.

                                                                7



           1         We established that we did not.

           2     Q.  When you use the word "we," who are you

           3         referring to?

           4     A.  Well, our laboratory personnel.  That

           5         would be if -- In the usual course, it

           6         would be the supervisor and the assistant

           7         supervisor in our laboratory, at that

           8         laboratory.

           9     Q.  Was a report generated as a result of this

          10         investigation?

          11     A.  I'm not sure of that.

          12     Q.  Who did you report to in that

          13         investigation?

          14     A.  Well, I didn't really report to anyone.  I

          15         was part of the investigation.  I was part

          16         of the group that met to understand what

          17         had happened.  Much of it was designed to

          18         see if we could improve our practices so

          19         that this wouldn't happen again in the

          20         future.

          21     Q.  When was this investigation conducted?

          22     A.  In that time frame.  I'm not sure it

          23         was -- If memory serves, there was a delay

          24         in our recognizing that there had been an

          25         error.  We normally hold samples,

                                                                8



           1         specimens like this for three weeks after

           2         we issue a report.  So it would have to

           3         have been at least a month or so,

           4         probably, before we began to investigate

           5         it.  So sometime after that we pursued

           6         this investigation.

           7     Q.  Was this a committee that was formed to

           8         investigate?

           9     A.  It was an ad hoc committee, if you will.

          10         It was what we call a root cause analysis.

          11         When a significant error is made, we try

          12         to understand what happened, why it

          13         happened, and what we can do better to

          14         avoid that happening again.

          15     Q.  Who was in charge of the investigation?

          16                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

          17             Go ahead.

          18     A.  It usually is initiated by Risk

          19         Management.

          20     Q.  For Albany Medical Center?

          21     A.  That's correct.

          22     Q.  And can you tell me who the members were

          23         of this ad hoc committee?

          24                   MR. BELL:  I'll object as to the

          25             identification of the people, but I --

                                                                9



           1             but they come from different

           2             departments, so I'll let him identify

           3             the departments that were involved and

           4             the representatives.  It is, I think,

           5             protected, but in this case I'm

           6             letting it go a little farther than I

           7             think I would otherwise.

           8     BY MR. MILLER:

           9     Q.  If you could tell me what departments were

          10         involved, please.

          11     A.  I probably wouldn't be able to tell you

          12         the individuals, anyway.  So I can tell you

          13         that we had members of nursing, Risk

          14         Management, patient access, the morgue,

          15         the laboratory/  I think hospital

          16         administration may have been there, as

          17         well, and I think there were others there.

          18         There were several members of the nursing

          19         services from different areas, from which

          20         this type of specimen might emanate.  So

          21         we might receive this type from the OR,

          22         labor and delivery, the emergency room.

          23     Q.  Did your protocols change?  When I said

          24         "your," I'm talking about Albany Medical

          25         Center or any of the departments of

                                                               10



           1         pathology.  Did the protocols change in

           2         the way samples are handled as a result of

           3         this investigation?

           4                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

           5             but you can answer.

           6     A.  I believe so, but I'm not -- I'm not able

           7         to tell you in what ways they did.  I

           8         think there were aspects of it that

           9         involved nursing and the laboratory and

          10         other forms of communication that were

          11         modified.

          12     Q.  As part of the investigation, were various

          13         individuals interviewed?

          14                   MR. BELL:  Objection, but you

          15             can answer.

          16     A.  I'm not sure what you mean by

          17         "interviewed."  Certainly there were

          18         questions that were addressed in terms of

          19         what people did or did not do and why they

          20         did or did not do what they did so we

          21         could understand what might have been a

          22         source of confusion or represent an

          23         opportunity for us to improve our process.

          24     Q.  When you say certain people were

          25         identified as to what they did or could do

                                                               11



           1         or did not do, did you or the committee or

           2         anybody at Albany Medical Center

           3         specifically identify the specific

           4         individual or individuals within any of

           5         the pathology departments who handled the

           6         sample and who ultimately discarded the

           7         sample?

           8                   MR. BELL:  Objection, but you

           9             can answer.

          10     A.  I suspect we were able to identify the

          11         personnel involved, but I don't -- I don't

          12         know who those people were at this point

          13         in time.

          14     Q.  Are there any records to identify who

          15         those personnel are?

          16     A.  I'm not sure of that.

          17     Q.  Putting aside for a moment the names of

          18         those individuals, can you tell me if

          19         those individuals you're referring to

          20         worked within a particular department or

          21         division of the hospital?

          22     A.  Yes, I think at least one of them I know

          23         was in our laboratory.

          24     Q.  And when you say "our laboratory," what

          25         specific laboratory are you referring to?

                                                               12



           1     A.  It's called Histology or Surgical

           2         Pathology.

           3     Q.  What is the difference between surgical

           4         pathology and the Department of Anatomic

           5         Pathology?

           6     A.  Well, in this hospital we call it the

           7         Division of Anatomic Pathology, which 

           8         encompasses other laboratories, including 

           9         Surgical Pathology.

          10     Q.  Now, back at the time frame we're talking

          11         about here, I understand you are the

          12         Director of Anatomic Pathology, correct?

          13     A.  Yes, sir.

          14     Q.  And when did you assume the directorship?

          15     A.  I believe it was '90 -- I'm not certain.

          16         In the -- '90 --

          17     Q.  I'm looking at your CV.

          18     A.  Thank you.

          19     Q.  1999.

          20     A.  Okay.

          21     Q.  And before that, you were the Director of

          22         Surgical Pathology?

          23     A.  Correct.

          24     Q.  Is there, in fact, a Department of

          25         Histology or does histology fall within

                                                               13



           1         the Surgical Sathology Department?

           2     A.  It's essentially the same department, just

           3         a different name.

           4     Q.  And what are your duties and

           5         responsibilities as Director of Anatomic

           6         Pathology?

           7     A.  Well, again, that encompasses not only

           8         surgical pathology, but also psychology

           9         and autopsy pathology and other services

          10         related to handling tissues and fluids for

          11         anatomic diagnosis.  My role there

          12         includes overseeing the operations to make

          13         sure that we maintain a quality

          14         performance.

          15     Q.  So you have administrative

          16         responsibilities?

          17     A.  Yes, sir.

          18     Q.  Do you have clinical responsibilities?

          19     A.  Outside of that title, I also operate as

          20         an attending pathologist and have a full

          21         service load, yes, sir.  Or I had had.

          22     Q.  Back in the fall of 2015, approximately

          23         how many employees worked within the

          24         Department of Anatomic Pathology?

          25     A.  We had a number of employees that were not

                                                               14



           1         full time.  I think we had about 12

           2         pathologists, probably 50 or 60 technical

           3         people, 10 or 12 office employees.  I'm

           4         ballparking it.  I don't know the exact

           5         number.

           6     Q.  So total, give or take, of 75 people?

           7     A.  Yes, sir.

           8     Q.  Do they all work at the same location?

           9     A.  No, sir.

          10     Q.  At different locations within the hospital

          11         building?

          12     A.  I believe so.

          13     Q.  All right.  And those 75 people, does that

          14         include the people who work for the

          15         department of surgical pathology as well?

          16     A.  Yes, sir.

          17     Q.  So do you make a distinction between

          18         people who work for surgical pathology

          19         versus anatomic pathology?

          20     A.  Only in certain respects.  Certainly not

          21         in operations that relate to the quality

          22         of the laboratory.

          23     Q.  And when we're talking about surgical

          24         pathology, just generally speaking, are we

          25         talking about samples that are provided

                                                               15



           1         for pathological analysis as the result of

           2         some surgical procedure?

           3     A.  In general.

           4     Q.  The Department of Anatomic Pathology, does

           5         it receive samples for analysis beyond

           6         just surgical samples?

           7     A.  Yes.

           8     Q.  And give me an example of the samples that

           9         you'd receive.

          10     A.  Well, one of the most conspicuous ones

          11         would cytology samples; so we have fluids

          12         or smears, so forth.  We do also receive

          13         remains in the autopsy suite.

          14         Occasionally a sample is obtained outside

          15         of the venue of normal operations, either

          16         through trauma or accident or something

          17         like that, some kind of non-surgical

          18         procedure.

          19     Q.  Were there various departments within the

          20         Department of Anatomic Pathology?

          21     A.  Various divisions, yeah.

          22     Q.  Please tell me what they were or are.

          23     A.  Well --

          24                   MR. BELL:  Objection.  You want

          25             him -- I don't know if it's changed

                                                               16



           1             since 2015 or not.

           2     BY MR. MILLER:

           3     Q.  Let's go back to 2015.

           4     A.  I think it's similar to that.  We have --

           5         The biggest divisions are surgical

           6         pathology, cytopathology, autopsy

           7         pathology.  Under those, we have

           8         subspecialty areas that include

           9         neuropathology, hematopathology,

          10         dermatopathology, and others that are less

          11         busy.

          12     Q.  Were there written protocols within the

          13         Department of Anatomic Pathology in 2015

          14         regarding how samples were to be handled

          15         when received by the Department of

          16         Anatomic Pathology?

          17     A.  Yes.

          18     Q.  And were those various written protocols

          19         broken down by the different types of

          20         pathology that you just referred to or was

          21         it one general overview of a protocol?

          22     A.  We have a requisition form that is

          23         distinct in surgical pathology from the

          24         one that we use in cytopathology.

          25     Q.  It's distinct in which way?

                                                               17



           1     A.  It's just a different form.  It has

           2         different needs and requirements to -- for

           3         us to operate effectively.

           4     Q.  Now, in the case that we're talking about,

           5         is it your understanding that fetal

           6         remains taken from Larissa Davis came to

           7         the Department of Anatomic Pathology?

           8     A.  Yes, sir.

           9     Q.  Something like that was -- Would it be

          10         fair if I classified it as a routine

          11         thing?

          12     A.  It is not uncommon for us to get those, so

          13         we handle those almost every day.

          14     Q.  Are there specific protocols for the way

          15         fetal remains are to be handled?

          16     A.  Yes.

          17     Q.  Is it your understanding in this case --

          18         Let me withdraw that.

          19                Is there a phrase within the

          20         department of pathology "medical waste"?

          21     A.  It is a term that is used.  I'm not

          22         certain if it's in our documents or

          23         protocols.  I don't know that answer.

          24     Q.  All right.  Putting aside your documents

          25         and protocols, have you heard the phrase

                                                               18



           1         "medical waste"?

           2     A.  Of course.

           3     Q.  What do you understand that to mean?

           4     A.  Well, it is a term that includes a variety

           5         of types of material that are deemed no

           6         longer necessary to retain for purposes of

           7         analysis or other reasons and can be

           8         disposed of.

           9     Q.  And back in 2015, in your laboratory, how

          10         was medical waste disposed of?

          11     A.  Well, we do have a variety of types of

          12         material that are encompassed in that

          13         term, again, including fluids, blood,

          14         things like that that are sometimes

          15         contaminating gauze or papers, and so

          16         those go in for that type of disposal.

          17         Our own laboratory also has the specimens

          18         that, after we have done what we are

          19         supposed to do with them, are also put

          20         through that disposal process.

          21     Q.  Specifically what is the disposal process?

          22     A.  So again, for those specimens, I think is

          23         what you're asking about.

          24     Q.  Yes.

          25     A.  We issue a report, we retain specimens for

                                                               19



           1         three weeks after the report is issued to

           2         permit -- provide an opportunity for us to

           3         hear back from someone if there are

           4         additional questions or concerns, and then

           5         they go for disposal.  We use an

           6         incinerating process, I think, through a

           7         company.

           8     Q.  You said in your answer that you hold on

           9         to the specimen for three weeks and then

          10         you issue a report?

          11     A.  No, sir.  We issue a report -- We receive

          12         the specimen, we process it, we issue the

          13         report.

          14     Q.  Regarding the specimen itself?

          15     A.  Right.  During that period, the specimen

          16         is held in storage.  We continue to hold

          17         it for three weeks after the report has

          18         been issued so that there is an

          19         opportunity for feedback.

          20     Q.  When you use the word "report," do you

          21         mean reporting on a pathological analysis?

          22     A.  Correct.  That diagnosis report as you see

          23         there.

          24     Q.  Okay.  Apart from the investigation that

          25         you were involved in, did you personally

                                                               20



           1         have any involvement with examination or

           2         analysis of fetal remains from Larissa

           3         Davis?

           4     A.  I'm not sure I understand your question.

           5     Q.  Did you examine the specimen in this case?

           6     A.  It was my report that has been issued from

           7         our lab.  My name is on that report.  I'm

           8         certain I did see the slides that were

           9         generated, the slide that was generated.

          10     Q.  So would your name be on that report if

          11         you did not personally examine those

          12         slides?

          13     A.  No, sir.

          14     Q.  So whoever personally examined that report

          15         would have his or her name on?

          16     A.  Correct.

          17     Q.  Okay.  Now, the incineration process, does

          18         Albany Medical Center have an incinerator

          19         for disposal of what it determines to be

          20         medical waste?

          21     A.  I'm not certain anymore what the process

          22         is after it goes from our lab.  I'll be

          23         honest, I don't know.

          24     Q.  Back in 2015, did Albany Medical Center

          25         have an incinerator on site, if you know?

                                                               21



           1     A.  I don't know the answer to that question.

           2     Q.  Who makes the determination that a

           3         specimen is no longer needed and they can

           4         dispose of it or incinerate it?

           5     A.  Well, we've had a practice that's based on

           6         an understanding through administrations

           7         in the hospital that this is the process

           8         by which we're going to dispose of these

           9         specimens.  And so I don't know if that

          10         was a decision that was made by -- I don't

          11         know who made the decision, if that's the

          12         question.

          13                   MR. BELL:  You mean in general,

          14             Jeff, or --

          15     BY MR. MILLER:

          16     Q.  Let me be more specific, okay?

          17                When a specimen is sent to your

          18         lab, the analysis is done.  Once the

          19         analysis is done, you hold on to that

          20         specimen for about three weeks, give or

          21         take.  From that point on, who within that

          22         lab has the responsibility or makes the

          23         determination to say we no longer have to

          24         keep this or maintain it, we're going to

          25         dispose of it?

                                                               22



           1     A.  I understand now, I think.

           2                So our practice includes a routine

           3         that would permit us to treat the vast

           4         majority of specimens in this fashion that

           5         we just described, which is a three-week

           6         hold period.  Our storage facilities do

           7         not permit us to hold so many specimens

           8         for an indefinite period of time, so the

           9         routine is to discard or dispose of these

          10         specimens after that three-week interval.

          11         If there is a special request, we would

          12         hold it in a somewhat -- in a similar, but

          13         different area for further analysis or

          14         disposition.

          15     Q.  When you use the word "routine" for

          16         disposal, is this a written protocol or

          17         it's just a verbal routine or understood

          18         routine?

          19     A.  I think it's written, but I don't know

          20         that I could pull it up.  It's the way

          21         we've practiced for many, many, many

          22         years.

          23     Q.  Is there an individual within the lab, or

          24         was there back in 2015, or department

          25         within the lab who made the determination

                                                               23



           1         we don't need a particular specimen, we

           2         can dispose of it, or is that

           3         determination made by different people in

           4         a case-by-case basis?

           5                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

           6             You can go ahead.

           7     A.  Well, we have a, I guess it's FIFO; first

           8         in, first out.  That's the storage system.

           9         So we actually go through each specimen

          10         and make sure that it has been signed out

          11         and that the three-week interval has been

          12         met, and we put that in for disposal.  So

          13         there is a process that treats all

          14         specimens in that fashion that are shelved

          15         as for disposal.

          16     Q.  Generally speaking, Doctor, with regard to

          17         each specimen that comes into the lab,

          18         going through analysis, and from there

          19         disposal or special request, is there

          20         paperwork that tracks that specimen from

          21         the moment it enters the lab to the moment

          22         it's discarded or treated or held on to?

          23     A.  So the paperwork that is that requisition

          24         form that comes with the specimen is

          25         married up with the specimen through the

                                                               24



           1         process until such time as a slide is

           2         made, slide or slides, and then it is

           3         married up with the slide.  So it is

           4         divorced from the specimen container at an

           5         intermediate period of the process.

           6                So once it is put into storage, the

           7         only way we can check it is through the

           8         computer, or we can make a special effort

           9         to go back and pull out the paperwork, but

          10         the report -- the paperwork does not stay

          11         with the specimen container indefinitely.

          12     Q.  A few minutes ago in one of your answers,

          13         you made reference to special requests

          14         being received from time to time by the

          15         lab; correct?

          16     A.  Correct.

          17     Q.  Could you tell me generally what you

          18         understand a special request to be?

          19     A.  Well, it's a request for us to do

          20         something other than routine.  We receive

          21         those -- sometimes as we receive this one

          22         written on the requisition sheet, other

          23         times there's a verbal communication,

          24         telephone or in person, email, fax.  We

          25         get communications in a variety of ways to

                                                               25



           1         give us this kind of special request.

           2     Q.  So if your lab received a requisition that

           3         said in words or substance hold fetal

           4         remains, parents want them for purposes of

           5         burial, would you consider that to be a

           6         special request?

           7     A.  Yes, sir.

           8     Q.  And generally speaking, how, back in 2015,

           9         were special requests handled or tracked?

          10     A.  Well, it depends on the request.

          11         Sometimes we get a request from a medical

          12         device company to hold something and so

          13         forth, but in this case, that request

          14         would have been met by putting the

          15         specimen in a separate area for -- for

          16         holding until we heard from the funeral

          17         home or whoever else reached out to us for

          18         that material.

          19     Q.  So do I take your answer to mean that if a

          20         special request is received by your

          21         department for a specimen, that specimen

          22         is not supposed to be disposed of or

          23         incinerated?

          24     A.  That's correct.  An error was made.

          25     Q.  Now, before you had mentioned that you get

                                                               26



           1         a requisition initially, and that if -- I

           2         assume that an inventory control number or

           3         something like that is given to a sample?

           4     A.  We have a unique identifier that is

           5         assigned to each case.

           6     Q.  And that unique identifier goes into the

           7         computer system?

           8     A.  Correct.

           9     Q.  As that sample that received a special

          10         request traveled in the system in your

          11         laboratory back in 2015, does that

          12         requisition with the special request

          13         travel with the specimen or do you have to

          14         look at the computer to know if there was

          15         a special request for that sample?

          16     A.  No.  It's only on the requisition itself.

          17     Q.  So if the requisition doesn't travel with

          18         the sample, the only way somebody handling

          19         that sample would know about that special

          20         request is by looking in the computer;

          21         correct?

          22     A.  No, it wouldn't be in the computer.

          23     Q.  Where would it be?

          24     A.  The special request is only on the

          25         requisition, and it would be set aside in

                                                               27



           1         the storage area so that if someone

           2         followed up and said I'm looking for that

           3         specimen, they would go in that area and

           4         look for it.  They would await that

           5         notification or call.  We can always

           6         recover the requisition sheet, but it

           7         doesn't stay with the specimen. It goes

           8         with the rest of the case.

           9     Q.  What I'm envisioning from your answers is

          10         that, within your laboratory, there's more

          11         than one storage area?

          12     A.  There's one storage area, but two -- It's

          13         divided.

          14     Q.  Okay.  Special request to the left, not

          15         special request to the right, okay?

          16     A.  Fair enough.

          17                   MR. BELL:  Objection.  But go

          18             ahead.

          19     BY MR. MILLER:

          20     Q.  And if you get a special request and it's

          21         supposed to go to the left, but, in fact,

          22         it is stored on the right side, nobody's

          23         ever going to know about that special

          24         request; correct?

          25     A.  That was the system we had in place at the

                                                               28



           1         time this event occurred.

           2     Q.  So there was no backup --

           3     A.  Correct.

           4     Q.  -- to make sure that the special request

           5         was honored; is that right?

           6     A.  I'm afraid that's correct.

           7     Q.  And that process is now a different

           8         process?

           9     A.  Yes, sir.

          10     Q.  I'm going to go through a series of

          11         documents with you.

          12     A.  All right.

          13     Q.  All right.  And then I'll get more

          14         specific about this case.

          15                   MR. MILLER:  I'm just going to

          16             hand these all to you.

          17                   MR. BELL:  Okay.

          18                   MR. MILLER:  We'll go through

          19             them.  If you can show the doctor

          20             number 1.

          21     BY MR. MILLER:

          22     Q.  Doctor, can you tell me what Exhibit 1 is,

          23         please?

          24     A.  This is an Albany Medical Center policy

          25         and procedure, number 10.09.  Subject is

                                                               29



           1         fetal death reporting.

           2     Q.  What's the purpose -- Withdraw that.

           3                Is this a policy, procedure or

           4         protocol of Albany Medical Center that was

           5         in effect back in November or October of

           6         2015?

           7     A.  It appears to be so.  It looks right,

           8         but -- The date here is effective 10/8/15,

           9         so that's part of that same time frame.

          10         I'm not sure if there was a modification

          11         around that time.  It might not have been

          12         communicated to everyone.  I don't know.

          13     Q.  What's the purpose of this policy and

          14         procedure, generally speaking?

          15     A.  Well, I think it's fairly stated here, to

          16         ensure an accurate and consistent method

          17         of completing the appropriate paperwork

          18         necessary to complete fetal death

          19         reporting.

          20     Q.  So this has to do with reporting of a

          21         death to the Department of Health and

          22         Vital Statistics?

          23     A.  Correct.

          24     Q.  Does this policy play any role in the --

          25         in your laboratory?

                                                               30



           1     A.  Well, it does insofar as we are aware of

           2         the importance of the 20-week time frame

           3         with respect to whether a death

           4         certificate needs to be filed or not.

           5         Obviously 20 weeks is sometimes difficult

           6         to establish.  You can use estimated date

           7         of confinement or other last period.

           8         There are other ways to establish that,

           9         but we basically don't have anything to do

          10         with this reporting, if that's the

          11         question.

          12     Q.  You mentioned 20 weeks.  What's the

          13         significance of 20 weeks?

          14     A.  Well, again, there's -- It's considered a

          15         death if it's more than 20 weeks, by the

          16         state.

          17     Q.  So if it's less than 20 weeks, what's it

          18         considered?

          19     A.  I'm not sure of the exact terminology, but

          20         it doesn't require this form be completed.

          21     Q.  So this form only needs to be completed

          22         under what circumstances?

          23     A.  I believe if it is 20 weeks of gestation.

          24         We still have a death notice, I think.  It

          25         is confusing in terms of the nomenclature

                                                               31



           1         and usage.  And one of the things that

           2         became evident with the root cause

           3         analysis was some of this confusion,

           4         but -- And I'm not the best person to

           5         speak to this, but I, myself, am sometimes

           6         confused.  But I think I stated fairly

           7         that there's a 20-week cutoff between what

           8         is considered a death by the State of New

           9         York.

          10     Q.  Does this policy, number 1, play any role

          11         in terms of how samples are handled in

          12         your laboratory?

          13     A.  Yes.

          14     Q.  And what role does it play?

          15     A.  Well, again, if it's less than 20 weeks,

          16         it is considered a surgical specimen and

          17         would be handled as we handled this one.

          18     Q.  So surgical specimen is one that typically

          19         is considered to be disposable?

          20     A.  Yes.

          21     Q.  And other than incinerating surgical or

          22         disposable samples, is there any other way

          23         to dispose of them that you're aware of?

          24                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          25             but go ahead.

                                                               32



           1     A.  Well, certainly we could do other things

           2         with them.  We could inter them.  That's

           3         done occasionally.

           4     Q.  That would be by special request?

           5     A.  Yes, sir.

           6     Q.  Back in the fall of 2015, was there a

           7         specific form that I will call a special

           8         request form?

           9     A.  I don't believe so.

          10     Q.  So back in 2015 -- and please tell me if

          11         I'm wrong here -- the only way that a

          12         special request can be honored is or was

          13         if the specimen were stored in the correct

          14         area of the laboratory?

          15                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          16             but you can answer.

          17     A.  I suppose there might have been another

          18         way it might have been done, but that

          19         would be the most reliable method.

          20     Q.  As part of your involvement in this case,

          21         either in the laboratory or since, have

          22         you looked to see if there are any or were

          23         there any entries in the computer at

          24         Albany Medical Center or its pathology

          25         laboratory that discussed this sample or

                                                               33



           1         discussed a special request?

           2     A.  Entries into the computer?

           3     Q.  Yes.  Any computer system, any computer

           4         entries, any digital entries with regard

           5         to this sample or with regard to the

           6         special request made for this sample?

           7     A.  Not that I'm aware of.

           8     Q.  If you could go to Exhibit 2, please.

           9         Exhibit 2 is an office note of Dr. Bruce

          10         Clark dated 10/26/15.  Do you know

          11         Dr. Clark?

          12     A.  I do.

          13     Q.  Who do you know him to be?

          14     A.  He's an obstetrician here in -- works

          15         primarily at Albany Med.

          16     Q.  Now, on the first page, at the top where

          17         it says "subjective," it talks about a

          18         follow-up for a post-spontaneous abortion.

          19         If you could read that first paragraph to

          20         yourself.

          21     A.  I do.  I have.  Okay.

          22     Q.  Do you see where it talks about patient

          23         presents for follow-up of post-spontaneous

          24         abortion?

          25     A.  Yes, sir.

                                                               34



           1     Q.  And then several lines down it says (as

           2         read):  Wants fetal remains for religious

           3         reasons.

           4     A.  Yes, sir.  I see that.

           5     Q.  Did you ever see this record before today?

           6     A.  I don't believe I did.

           7     Q.  Now, if a doctor makes a note such as this

           8         in his or her medical record, back in

           9         2015, was there any practice or procedure

          10         in place that would result in a record

          11         like this going to the pathology

          12         department?

          13     A.  No, sir.

          14     Q.  So the special requests that were made,

          15         what kind of form was it that would notify

          16         the department that it's supposed to

          17         handle a specific specimen a certain way?

          18     A.  The only form is that requisition form.

          19         As I said, we often receive special

          20         requests through other forms of

          21         communication, but in terms of a written

          22         form, that's the only one.

          23     Q.  Now, at the bottom of Exhibit 2, next to

          24         comments, it says (as read):  Patient had

          25         D&C tomorrow, 10/27/15.  And under that:

                                                               35



           1         She agrees to have chromosomal testing

           2         done.

           3                Do you see where I'm referring to?

           4     A.  Yes, sir.

           5     Q.  When chromosomal testing is done,

           6         generally speaking, is that testing done

           7         at your laboratory or would it be sent out

           8         to a different laboratory?

           9     A.  It's a different lab.

          10     Q.  Okay.  And in order to -- Well, withdraw

          11         that.

          12                Let's assume, generally speaking,

          13         that your laboratory receives fetal

          14         remains and those remains are to be tested

          15         for chromosomal abnormalities.  What

          16         portion -- What do you do with the sample

          17         in order to be able to do that testing?

          18     A.  Well, it would have to be fresh.  As I

          19         remember, looking at the report yesterday,

          20         this was received in formalin, so that

          21         would preclude any such possibility of

          22         arcinia (phonetic) for cytogenetic testing. 

          23         So if we receive something fresh, then we take

          24         some of that tissue, we don't need a lot,

          25         but they -- or they don't need a lot.  We

                                                               36



           1         send some fresh tissue for cytogenetic

           2         testing.

           3     Q.  All right.  When you use the word

           4         "formalin," please explain that in lay

           5         person terms.

           6     A.  Well, formaldehyde is a chemical designed

           7         for the preservation of tissues.  It

           8         affixes tissues in a way that permits us

           9         to handle them more consistently or

          10         readily.  This is a -- Formalin is a

          11         diluted form of formaldehyde.

          12     Q.  Now, I believe in one of the exhibits you

          13         have the chromosome analysis.

          14                   MR. BELL:  Want me to show it to

          15             him?

          16                   MR. MILLER:  Of course, yes.

          17     BY MR. MILLER:

          18     Q.  You're now looking at Exhibit 11.  Is that

          19         the chromosome analysis with regard to the

          20         specimen in this case?

          21     A.  Again, this did not come from us.  It did

          22         not come from our lab.  It was not part of

          23         the specimen we received.  So this was

          24         sent from Dr. Clark or one of his people

          25         for this testing, presumably roughly the

                                                               37



           1         same time frame that they sent the rest of

           2         the case to us, but we did not have any

           3         part in submitting this tissue, nor

           4         generating this report.

           5     Q.  So this tissue was not submitted to your

           6         lab for chromosomal analysis; correct?

           7     A.  That's correct.

           8     Q.  And you're saying that Dr. Clark would

           9         prepare a portion of the sample or the

          10         tissue, send it out himself to the lab for

          11         chromosomal analysis independent of your

          12         lab; correct?

          13     A.  Correct.  Yeah.  So he may have used, you

          14         know, some nursing staff in his suite to

          15         facilitate that.  But yeah, it was done

          16         outside our laboratory.

          17     Q.  Now, when a sample of tissue is sent out

          18         for chromosomal testing like this, is the

          19         tissue placed on a slide or how is it

          20         prepared?

          21     A.  When it's sent for chromosomal analysis,

          22         I'm not prepared to be specific about the

          23         optimal way they would like to get it, but

          24         it has to be fresh, and it's usually in

          25         some kind of carrying media that provides

                                                               38



           1         that sustenance to preserve the tissue as

           2         best as possible.

           3     Q.  So in order to be able to do the

           4         chromosomal analysis, the amount of tissue

           5         that a lab would need is a very small

           6         percentage of the --

           7     A.  Yes, sir.  I don't know if they describe

           8         it here, but it's usually not -- you know,

           9         I mean, we -- I don't know the amount, but

          10         it's -- it would be a small part of most

          11         specimens.

          12     Q.  So even after that specimen for

          13         chromosomal testing is sent out, the

          14         overwhelming majority of the tissue is

          15         still in existence to be sent to your

          16         laboratory; correct?

          17     A.  Correct.

          18     Q.  I believe this is Exhibit 3, Albany

          19         Medical Center Division of Anatomic

          20         Pathology; correct?

          21     A.  Yes, sir.

          22     Q.  What is the purpose of this form,

          23         Exhibit 3?

          24     A.  This is a request for our services.  So we

          25         are like other physicians, we are

                                                               39



           1         consultants.  We are asked to provide a

           2         consultation on, in most cases, tissue

           3         material.  And the form provides us the

           4         demographic information so that we can be

           5         certain that the specimen in the container

           6         is -- belongs to this patient, and then

           7         there's additional opportunity for

           8         information about what the specimen is,

           9         what the preop diagnosis, the procedure,

          10         clinical history and so forth.

          11     Q.  All right.  This form is -- shows a

          12         collection date of 10/27/15; correct?

          13     A.  Yes, sir.

          14     Q.  Does that mean the tissue sample was

          15         collected on 10/27/15?

          16     A.  Presumably.  That is correct.

          17     Q.  And is that day, 10/27/15, your

          18         understanding as to when Larissa Davis had

          19         a D&C?

          20     A.  Yes, sir.

          21     Q.  And it says (as read):  Location, OR 15.

          22         Is that the operating room where the

          23         tissue was collected?

          24     A.  Yes, sir.

          25     Q.  And the initials next to that, what do

                                                               40



           1         they stand for?

           2     A.  I think that's probably some of the

           3         nursing personnel, those people -- I don't

           4         know -- I never really use that or look at

           5         that.

           6     Q.  And then it is preprinted to say under

           7         that (as read):  Request for surgical

           8         pathology tissue analysis?

           9     A.  Yes, sir.  This is a preprinted form.

          10     Q.  Okay.  Under that, it says (as read):

          11         Note, specimen number.  And write a source

          12         description for each one.  Record the

          13         number and source description of the

          14         specimen container; correct?

          15     A.  Yes, sir.

          16     Q.  Now, when it refers to specimen number,

          17         what -- what is that?

          18     A.  Well, in some cases some patients have

          19         procedures that generate more than one

          20         specimen from different sites or different

          21         types of tissue, so it's necessary for us

          22         to, you know, be able to document each and

          23         every one of those.  In this case there

          24         was a single specimen.

          25     Q.  Was the single specimen, which were the

                                                               41



           1         products of conception, given a specimen

           2         number?

           3     A.  Yes, sir.

           4     Q.  And from this form, can you identify where

           5         that number is?

           6     A.  There's a label across the upper portion

           7         in that box right beneath those initials

           8         that you just asked me about.

           9     Q.  Okay.

          10     A.  S1520868.

          11     Q.  That's a number that is given to this

          12         specimen by --

          13     A.  By our laboratory.  That's our unique

          14         identifying number for our information

          15         system.

          16     Q.  When you say "information system," what

          17         are you talking about?

          18     A.  We have our own information system for

          19         anatomic pathology so that our reports are

          20         captured in there with all the elements of

          21         the process that we can include.

          22     Q.  Let me ask you this:  Is the information

          23         system computerized?

          24     A.  Yes, sir.

          25     Q.  So the number that's assigned to this

                                                               42



           1         particular sample was in a computer

           2         program at your laboratory; correct?

           3                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

           4             but go ahead.

           5     A.  In the program, it's in the database,

           6         yeah.

           7     Q.  Okay.  And what types of information, back

           8         in 2015, went into the database with

           9         regard to each tissue sample received by

          10         the lab under a particular identifying

          11         number?

          12     A.  I think it's most easily recognized by

          13         that report form that is available.  It

          14         includes the demographics, patient's name,

          15         age and date -- you know, date of birth,

          16         and their medical record number.  It also

          17         includes information from this requisition

          18         form, in part.  It also includes our

          19         description of the gross interpretation,

          20         and finally a report of the diagnosis

          21         itself.

          22     Q.  Is any information entered into the

          23         database regarding special requests?

          24     A.  No.

          25     Q.  Now, under the preprinted sentence (as

                                                               43



           1         read):  Request for surgical pathology

           2         tissue, et cetera, under that, it says:

           3         All of the following information is

           4         required by CLIA, then JCAHO and/or New

           5         York State Department of Health

           6         regulations.

           7                Can you tell me what CLIA is,

           8         please?

           9     A.  That's Clinical Laboratory Inspection

          10         Association.  I'm not sure of the I, but

          11         it's an agency that inspects and regulates

          12         laboratories.  JCAHO is the Joint

          13         Commission, American hospitals.  And New

          14         York State has its own set of regulations.

          15         Each of those agencies have oversight and

          16         requirements for our laboratory.

          17     Q.  Now, when it says here all the following

          18         information is required, specifically what

          19         information is required?

          20     A.  Well, we have a little license there to

          21         hopefully prompt them to give us

          22         information.  They don't always do so, but

          23         the information that we request is

          24         designed to provide us with as much

          25         information as we can get so that we can

                                                               44



           1         do a better job in interpreting the

           2         specimens.  The more information they get

           3         us, sometimes the better able we are to

           4         report.  But there -- Those aspects of the

           5         information that we seek include preop

           6         diagnosis, surgical procedure, and the

           7         clinical history.

           8     Q.  Could you tell me what the preop diagnosis

           9         is, as stated on Exhibit 3, please?

          10     A.  Well, I can read it for you if youd like.

          11     Q.  Sure.

          12     A.  (As read):  42-year-old gravitas 7, para

          13         5, 015, female with IUFD at approximately

          14         15 weeks.  Fetus measuring 12 weeks.

          15     Q.  A couple lines down there's a heading (as

          16         read):  Additional comments.  Next to that

          17         it says:  Contents should be given to

          18         Levine Funeral Home at patient's request;

          19         is that correct?

          20     A.  Yes, sir.

          21     Q.  Is that a special request?

          22     A.  Yes, sir.

          23     Q.  Am I correct that a mother that miscarries

          24         and wants the products of conception

          25         cannot remove the products of conception

                                                               45



           1         from the hospital by herself?

           2     A.  Correct.

           3     Q.  Those products of conception can only be

           4         taken from the hospital by a funeral home;

           5         correct?

           6                   MR. BELL:  If you know.

           7     A.  The only reason I'm hesitating is there --

           8         there has been an effort in the last few

           9         years to modify that for consumption of

          10         certain placental parts.  And so I'm not

          11         certain that the answer is strictly no --

          12     Q.  Back in 2015 --

          13     A.  So it's happened in the last few years, so

          14         I don't know the time frame, but in

          15         general, the answer is it should go to a

          16         funeral home for burial, but there is a

          17         special exemption now for placental

          18         tissues.

          19     Q.  Exemption for what purpose?

          20     A.  Again, for creating edible tissue.

          21     Q.  Now, do you know if Levine Funeral Home

          22         had any contact with the pathology

          23         laboratory after this sample was received

          24         by your laboratory on October 27, 2015?

          25     A.  It is my understanding that they reached

                                                               46



           1         out to our laboratory after the -- after

           2         the delivery.  And I don't know the

           3         particulars of that, but I do know that at

           4         some point it was made -- they were made

           5         aware that they were no longer in our --

           6         in our laboratory.

           7     Q.  You say it's your understanding that

           8         Levine Funeral Home reached out --

           9     A.  I'm sorry.  They -- In the normal -- If

          10         this had been handled appropriately, they

          11         would have called and we would have

          12         released it to them.  So that is the

          13         normal operation for this.  I think they

          14         did reach out or did call, and I'm not

          15         certain if they called and they were told,

          16         oh, yeah, it's here, and then they found

          17         out it wasn't here, or if they called and

          18         they were told it wasn't here.  But I know

          19         that at some point -- I think that is what

          20         exposed this issue was that they called

          21         and it was clear that we did not retain

          22         this material.

          23     Q.  So Levine Funeral Home called and said,

          24         hey, we've been contacted to get these

          25         remains --

                                                               47



           1     A.  I don't know about that, but --

           2     Q.  Well --

           3     A.  I'm saying I don't know --

           4     Q.  In any event --

           5     A.  -- that verbiage.

           6     Q.  It's your understanding, though, Levine

           7         Funeral Home contacted the pathology lab

           8         looking for the remains, and there was

           9         nothing to provide to Levine Funeral Home

          10         because those remains had been

          11         incinerated; right?

          12                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          13             but go ahead.

          14     A.  I think that is correct.  That's my

          15         understanding.

          16     Q.  Now, where does your understanding come

          17         from that Levine contacted the funeral --

          18         contacted the Department of Pathology?

          19     A.  It's just my memory, vague though it may

          20         be, that that is how this was brought to

          21         light.

          22     Q.  Did you personally speak with anybody from

          23         Levine Funeral Home?

          24     A.  I don't believe so.

          25     Q.  Do you know of anyone specifically who

                                                               48



           1         did?

           2     A.  No.

           3     Q.  Do you know if Levine Funeral Home

           4         actually ever came to your department

           5         looking for remains?

           6     A.  I don't know that either.

           7     Q.  Was any record or form prepared or any

           8         input into the database with regard to

           9         Larissa Davis' desire to have Levine

          10         Funeral Home pick up these remains?

          11                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.  I

          12             think he's asked and answered, but you

          13             can answer again.

          14     A.  I don't believe so.  Not to my knowledge.

          15     Q.  Now, toward the bottom of the form, it

          16         says (as read):  Physician's name.  It

          17         appears to be Dr. Walia, W-a-l-i-a.

          18                Do you know Dr. Walia?

          19     A.  No, sir.  I do not.

          20     Q.  And then the supervising physician was

          21         Dr. Clark; correct?

          22     A.  Correct.

          23     Q.  Let me show you -- ask you to go to

          24         Exhibit 4 if you would, please.  And could

          25         you please tell me what Exhibit 4 is?

                                                               49



           1     A.  This is our report on that tissue that

           2         we've discussed.

           3     Q.  All right.  So the Davis fetal tissue

           4         received on October 27, 2015, per

           5         Exhibit 3, was analyzed and resulted in a

           6         report which is Exhibit 4; is that

           7         correct?

           8     A.  Yes, sir.

           9     Q.  So these fetal remains were analyzed on

          10         October 27, 2015, the same date that they

          11         were received; correct?

          12     A.  I don't believe so.  It looks -- I'm

          13         sorry.  We -- We analyze them over the

          14         next few days.  I don't know exactly when

          15         we first did this gross inspection.  It

          16         looks like it may have been over a

          17         weekend, but I don't know the time frame

          18         there, but normally this would -- would

          19         not take more than a few days.  Looks like

          20         it took a little bit longer, so I'm

          21         wondering if there was a weekend in there,

          22         but -- So I don't know the answer to your

          23         question whether we inspected it that day

          24         or it was accessioned that day, so...

          25     Q.  What does the accession date mean?

                                                               50



           1     A.  So that means it was entered into the

           2         system.  The specimen and the requisition

           3         form came to our lab, they were entered

           4         into the computer as a new specimen for

           5         us, a new case, and assigned this case

           6         number.

           7     Q.  And when you refer to a case number, is

           8         that the ECD number?

           9     A.  No, sir.  That's this -- Right at the

          10         very --

          11     Q.  Case number at the top?

          12     A.  S15.  Yes, sir.

          13     Q.  Is that the same number that appears on --

          14     A.  Yes, sir.

          15     Q.  -- Exhibit 3 which you mentioned before?

          16                   MR. BELL:  Yes.

          17     A.  Yes.

          18     Q.  Now, the final diagnosis says -- talks

          19         about uterine contents.  The products of

          20         conception including placental, chorionic

          21         villi, and fetal parts; correct?

          22     A.  (Nodding.)

          23                   MR. BELL:  Yes?

          24     A.  Yes.

          25

                                                               51



           1     BY MR. MILLER:

           2     Q.  What does chorionic villi mean?

           3     A.  That's the part of the placental tissue

           4         that is designed for providing nutrition.

           5     Q.  And then there's a statement (as read):

           6         Testing -- Attesting that there was

           7         microscopic examination of the slides or

           8         materials that the pathologist reviewed,

           9         approved, and electronically signed;

          10         correct?  And your name appears there;

          11         correct?

          12     A.  Correct.

          13     Q.  So as part of your analysis, were tissue

          14         slides prepared?

          15     A.  Yes, sir.

          16     Q.  And who would have prepared those tissue

          17         slides?

          18     A.  Technical personnel in the laboratory.

          19     Q.  And the tissue slides that are prepared,

          20         is that made from just a very small

          21         portion of the tissue sample received by

          22         the lab?

          23     A.  In this case, that is correct.

          24     Q.  So one of the technical people in the lab

          25         would have received the fetal remains,

                                                               52



           1         would have prepared a tissue sample -- a

           2         slide sample, and then that slide would be

           3         presented to you for analysis; correct?

           4     A.  Essentially, correct.

           5     Q.  So did you personally just see the slide

           6         or did you ever just see the full fetal

           7         remains?

           8     A.  I only saw the slide.

           9     Q.  Did the remainder of the fetal remains

          10         after the slide was prepared stay with the

          11         technical person who prepared the slide?

          12     A.  Again, the procedure includes an

          13         inspection of the material, we call it

          14         gross, at the gross level, that is the

          15         naked eye level.  So they would identify

          16         portions of that material that were

          17         representative in one cassette, which is

          18         what they did, and then the rest of the

          19         material was put in for storage.

          20     Q.  And if -- If it was the technical person

          21         or somebody else who put this into storage

          22         and did not have this form, Exhibit 3, which

          23         says contents should be given to the

          24         Levine Funeral Home, the person putting it

          25         in storage would never know that request

                                                               53



           1         was made; right?

           2     A.  Well --

           3                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

           4             but go ahead.

           5     A.  That form should be with the specimen at

           6         that time.

           7     Q.  But if it wasn't, that person would have

           8         no idea that this request was made; right?

           9     A.  Well, that would be true, but that was not

          10         the case.

          11     Q.  Okay.  What was the case then?

          12     A.  Well, it should have been with the

          13         specimen as it was grossed.

          14     Q.  Okay.

          15     A.  This is actually a three-ply.  So we have

          16         a top copy that is maintained in a clean

          17         environment, and this could have formalin

          18         or fluids on it in the gross inspection,

          19         so that copy is discarded, and then

          20         there's a third copy that goes with the

          21         specimen through the -- to me.  So I would

          22         see this copy with the slide.  I would see

          23         the third copy with the slide.

          24     Q.  All right.  So I'm assuming you read this?

          25     A.  Yes.  I just assumed it was done

                                                               54



           1         correctly.

           2     Q.  Because I assume you're not the one who

           3         goes and puts these tissue samples in

           4         storage; right?

           5     A.  No, sir.

           6     Q.  That's why you have technical staff?

           7     A.  Correct.

           8     Q.  And --

           9     A.  The vast majority of instances happens as

          10         it should.  This is an error.

          11     Q.  Has this error happened before?

          12                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

          13             You can answer.

          14     A.  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.

          15     Q.  You have been employed by Albany Medical

          16         Center for quite some time; correct?

          17     A.  Yes, sir.

          18     Q.  In the course of your career at Albany

          19         Medical Center, are you aware of any other

          20         instance when a special request was made

          21         for preservation of the fetal remains, for

          22         whatever purpose, and those fetal remains

          23         were discarded contrary to the special

          24         request?

          25     A.  Not in my memory.  No, sir.

                                                               55



           1     Q.  Do you know of anybody else at Albany

           2         Medical Center who's had that experience?

           3                   MR. BELL:  Objection.  If you

           4             know.

           5     A.  I'm not sure I understand.

           6     Q.  Other than putting -- Have you spoken to

           7         any other pathologist or any other member

           8         of that department who is aware -- who has

           9         told you that special requests were not

          10         honored?

          11     A.  No, sir.

          12     Q.  So you would have received a copy of the

          13         special request?

          14     A.  I would have received a copy of that

          15         form --

          16     Q.  Okay.

          17     A.  -- with the request for special handling.

          18     Q.  After you complete your analysis, what do

          19         you do with the tissue slide and what do

          20         you do with this form?

          21                   MR. BELL:  The form, again, for

          22             the record, is being Exhibit number --

          23                   MR. MILLER:  3.

          24     A.  So we have a working document, a

          25         preliminary report, a copy of that

                                                               56



           1         requisition form, and the slide come to me

           2         together.  And I was -- At that time we

           3         were dictating, so I would dictate that

           4         case along with other cases and turn that

           5         into our office, and it would ultimately

           6         be signed out and those copies would be

           7         filed.  So the slide also goes to a

           8         separate file.

           9     Q.  When you're dictating, specifically what's

          10         the subject matter of your dictation?  The

          11         pathological analysis?

          12     A.  It's encompassed in that.  I would dictate

          13         it -- In this case I would say the

          14         patient's name, the case number, and

          15         the --

          16     Q.  The description?

          17     A.  No, not -- Just this piece right here, the

          18         uterine contents, colon, products of

          19         conception included.

          20     Q.  When you're dictating, does that go into

          21         the database?

          22     A.  There's a --

          23                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          24             but go ahead.

          25     A.  Actually we were using cassette tapes at

                                                               57



           1         that time.

           2     Q.  When somebody transcribes it, does it go

           3         into the database?

           4     A.  Yes, sir.  This is -- This is entered just

           5         as you see it.

           6                   MR. BELL:  This being Exhibit 4.

           7     BY MR. MILLER:

           8     Q.  When you're dictating, do you dictate

           9         anything about the special request?

          10     A.  No.

          11     Q.  So if I understand you correctly, the

          12         special request for preservation of the

          13         fetal remains in this case are never

          14         entered into the database?

          15                   MR. BELL:  Objection.  Asked and

          16             answered, but go ahead.

          17     A.  That's correct.

          18     Q.  And you may have answered me.  I apologize

          19         if I'm repeating this.  Once you were done

          20         with your analysis, what happened to the

          21         copy of the special request that you had

          22         with you when you're examining the tissue?

          23     A.  The copy I had, I think, actually does get

          24         discarded, but the original top copy,

          25         which is the same -- the original top copy

                                                               58



           1         is filed.

           2     Q.  Filed where or with whom?

           3     A.  It's filed with -- We have a paper file in

           4         which we keep all of these records.  We're

           5         moving to scanning now, but at that time

           6         we still had bound volumes of the

           7         information that related to this case,

           8         which would include that requisition form

           9         and this report, and perhaps --

          10                   MR. BELL:  This being the

          11             report.  That's fine.

          12     BY MR. MILLER:

          13     Q.  You're saying you had a special file where

          14         this would be placed?

          15     A.  At the end of the year we bind -- we send

          16         these for binding, big volumes with -- you

          17         know, we have 60,000 cases a year or

          18         something.

          19     Q.  Okay.  Before it gets bound together,

          20         where does the --

          21     A.  There's a --

          22                   MR. BELL:  Let him finish asking

          23             the question.

          24     BY MR. MILLER:

          25     Q.  Where does the special request go?

                                                               59



           1                   MR. BELL:  The requisition

           2             sheet?

           3                   MR. MILLER:  Correct.

           4     A.  There's a lateral drawer file where we

           5         keep active cases until they are bound.

           6     Q.  A lateral --

           7     A.  It was just a file cabinet.

           8     Q.  As a sample goes through your laboratory,

           9         or did back in 2015, it sounds like the

          10         sample would pass through various hands,

          11         different people as part of the process;

          12         would that be correct?

          13     A.  Yes, sir.

          14     Q.  And as that sample gets further down the

          15         line, those people are handling it further

          16         down the line, do they have to go to this

          17         file cabinet and look to see if there a

          18         special requisition for this particular

          19         sample or case each time they handle the

          20         sample?

          21     A.  So again, the break point here was at the

          22         level of the specimen container that we

          23         were asked to retain in a special way.  So

          24         that was accessioned and then evaluated

          25         into gross inspection, and then put into a

                                                               60



           1         file.  So there were only really probably

           2         three people that handled that.  This

           3         material that was taken for our analysis

           4         as a representative portion of this was

           5         ultimately handled by a number of people,

           6         and this special request had nothing to do

           7         with that.

           8                So if we have other special

           9         requests, we have ways of handling those

          10         if they require special testing, but not

          11         special handling, if you understand.

          12     Q.  Let me ask you this:  When this specimen

          13         arrived at the laboratory on October 27,

          14         2015, what was it contained in?

          15     A.  I assume some kind of plastic transparent

          16         cup with formalin.

          17     Q.  And does that sample stay in that cup

          18         throughout the entire process until

          19         discarded?

          20     A.  Apart from the time during which we have

          21         this gross inspection, it does.

          22     Q.  All right.  Did you have any process, back

          23         in 2015, where a sample like this comes

          24         into your laboratory, there is a

          25         requisition containing a special request,

                                                               61



           1         and you put a label on it that says

           2         special request or special handling?  Was

           3         there anything like that?

           4                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form and

           5             you're getting a little excited.  I

           6             understand, but please calm down.

           7     A.  No, we did not.

           8                   MR. MILLER:  I don't know what

           9             number this is.  This is out of order,

          10             Bruce.

          11                   MR. BELL:  Number 7.

          12     BY MR. MILLER:

          13     Q.  Doctor, I'm going to show you Exhibit

          14         number 7.  Could you please tell me what

          15         that is?

          16     A.  This is our accessioning procedure for the

          17         computer system in our laboratory.

          18     Q.  Okay.  When you say "accessioning

          19         procedure," could you break that down for

          20         me and tell me in lay person's terms what

          21         that means?

          22     A.  Well, we want to assign -- assign a unique

          23         identifying case number to each specimen

          24         as it comes in to the lab.

          25     Q.  Is Exhibit 7 -- Was Exhibit 7 a policy or

                                                               62



           1         a procedure or written protocol that was

           2         utilized by the lab back in the fall of

           3         2015?

           4     A.  Yes, sir.

           5     Q.  And the purpose of this is to -- this

           6         policy was to give a unique identifying

           7         number to the specimen itself?

           8     A.  Yes, sir.  Well, to enter it into the

           9         system so that we could provide a report

          10         with that unique number.

          11     Q.  Now, back in the fall of 2015, did the

          12         department of pathology have any written

          13         or printed or digital policies, procedures

          14         or protocols as to how special requests

          15         were to be handled?

          16     A.  I think you've asked me that before.  I

          17         can't remember any such specific policy,

          18         no, sir.

          19     Q.  Is there presently a written policy or

          20         procedure or protocol with how special

          21         requests are to be handled?

          22                   MR. BELL:  Object to the form.

          23             You can answer.

          24     A.  I'm not sure of that either.  I don't

          25         know.

                                                               63



           1     Q.  Doctor, I'm showing you Exhibit 8.  Could

           2         you please tell me what that is?

           3     A.  The subject is death and its management,

           4         Albany Medical Center hospital policy and

           5         procedure.

           6     Q.  Is this policy and procedure specific to

           7         the department of pathology?

           8     A.  No, sir.

           9     Q.  Does the -- Back in 2015, was this a

          10         policy or procedure that the department of

          11         pathology followed?

          12     A.  Yes, sir.

          13     Q.  And if I understand this correctly, this

          14         policy, procedure was effective

          15         8/18/03 and last reviewed on 10/27/15;

          16         correct?

          17     A.  Yes, sir.

          18     Q.  In other words, this policy was

          19         reviewed --

          20     A.  That date.

          21     Q.  -- on the date that Mrs. Davis had a D&C;

          22         correct?

          23     A.  It was reviewed by someone.  I'm not sure.

          24     Q.  Okay.  Now, on the second page, on Roman

          25         numeral X, it talks -- this policy talks

                                                               64



           1         about fetal death; correct?

           2     A.  Right.  Yes.

           3     Q.  And under the first paragraph, it says (as

           4         read):  Fetal death is defined as death

           5         prior to the complete expulsion or

           6         extraction from its mother of a product of

           7         conception.  The death is indicated by the

           8         fact that after such separation, a fetus

           9         does not breathe or show any evidence of

          10         life such as beating of the heart,

          11         pulsation of the umbilical cord or

          12         definite movement of the voluntary

          13         muscles; correct?

          14     A.  Correct.

          15     Q.  All right.  Now, this particular paragraph

          16         does not distinguish between a fetus that

          17         is more than 20 weeks old or less than 20

          18         weeks old; correct?

          19     A.  This paragraph does not.

          20     Q.  The next paragraph, though, last sentence

          21         in that paragraph states that (as read):

          22         All stillborn fetuses 20 weeks gestational

          23         age or more must have the body released to

          24         a funeral director for disposition, burial

          25         or cremation; correct?

                                                               65



           1     A.  Correct.

           2     Q.  Back in October of 2015, if you receive

           3         the fetal remains of a fetus that was 20

           4         weeks or more, was that sample labeled or

           5         identified somehow that somebody would

           6         know this was 20 weeks or more, meaning we

           7         can only release it to a funeral director?

           8     A.  Yes.

           9     Q.  And how was that done?

          10     A.  Well, often it's done before we receive

          11         it.  And some of this documentation

          12         inherent in this policy and procedure is

          13         completed in a way that would direct us to

          14         the morgue itself rather than to the

          15         surgical pathology lab.  In some cases

          16         this 20-week cutoff is difficult to

          17         establish, so we have to make inquiries

          18         and try to establish as best we can, but

          19         sometimes we get involved, sometimes we

          20         don't.

          21     Q.  Well, were there occasions and are there

          22         occasions when the department of pathology

          23         receives a sample or the fetal remains

          24         they know are more than 20 weeks to do

          25         some analysis --

                                                               66



           1     A.  Yes, sir.

           2     Q.  -- for testing on?

           3     A.  Yes, sir.

           4     Q.  And under those circumstances, is it

           5         understood within the department that once

           6         we -- once those tests or analyses are

           7         completed, those remains can only be

           8         released to a funeral home?

           9     A.  Yes, sir.

          10     Q.  So under those circumstances, when fetal

          11         remains of a fetus that are more than 20

          12         weeks are sent to the lab for analysis,

          13         how is that tissue labeled or identified

          14         so that you know this sample must go to a

          15         funeral home?

          16     A.  Well, we treat it differently and it goes

          17         to the morgue.

          18     Q.  Okay.  So if a doctor requests some

          19         analysis before it gets to you, it would

          20         go to the morgue?

          21     A.  (Nodding.)

          22                   MR. BELL:  Yes?

          23     A.  Correct.

          24     Q.  And then the morgue would contact you?

          25     A.  Well, we may do an analysis down there in

                                                               67



           1         the morgue.

           2     Q.  I see.  Are there instances when the

           3         analysis is -- under those circumstances

           4         I've just described, are done in your

           5         laboratory?

           6     A.  Probably occasionally just for expeditious

           7         reasons, but again, it would be identified

           8         and returned to the morgue.

           9     Q.  So typically when you would receive fetal

          10         remains, do you get some information as to

          11         the gestational age?

          12     A.  We must.  We cannot define that ourselves.

          13     Q.  Do you have any knowledge as to whether or

          14         not a request for an autopsy was made by

          15         anybody with regard to the Davis fetal

          16         remains?

          17     A.  I have no personal knowledge that such a

          18         request was ever made.

          19     Q.  As a result of your investigation, did you

          20         ever learn that a request for an autopsy

          21         was ever made?

          22     A.  I don't believe so.

          23     Q.  Are there occasions when your laboratory

          24         would receive fetal remains and a request

          25         for an autopsy is made?

                                                               68



           1     A.  Yes, sir.

           2     Q.  And that request for the autopsy, is it

           3         logged in somewhere or recorded somewhere?

           4     A.  Yes.  We actually assign it -- Well, if

           5         it's after 20 weeks, we would assign it

           6         with a different prefix code for autopsy.

           7         If it's under 20 weeks, we would -- we

           8         would do a limited form of an autopsy, but

           9         it would still be a surgical case number.

          10         It might not be designated as such.

          11     Q.  It might not be designated as an autopsy?

          12     A.  As an autopsy, correct.

          13     Q.  When your laboratory receives a sample,

          14         any kind of sample for analysis, and a

          15         family member calls the lab to inquire as

          16         to the status perhaps of analysis, are

          17         those phone calls logged in at all?

          18     A.  I'm not certain.  I think not, but it --

          19         Historically we haven't just because we

          20         receive so many phone calls and it's so

          21         busy we just don't have the staff or the

          22         personnel to do that.

          23     Q.  As a result of your investigation, did you

          24         speak to or identify anybody who ever

          25         spoke to Mr. or Mrs. Davis?

                                                               69



           1     A.  I know that -- My memory is that I spoke

           2         with Mr. Davis at a point in time during

           3         this early aftermath, and I think he also

           4         spoke with Dr. Rosano, perhaps.  I think

           5         Dr. Rosano asked me to speak with him, but

           6         I'm not certain whether he spoke with

           7         Dr. Rosano or not, but I'm pretty

           8         confident that I spoke with him.

           9     Q.  Are you speaking now from recollection?

          10     A.  My own personal memory of having conversed

          11         with him about this and, you know,

          12         expressing my condolences and my own

          13         personal upset that we had done this, but

          14         I don't -- I don't remember any specific

          15         comments that I might have made, just in

          16         general.

          17     Q.  Are there any records regarding that

          18         conversation?

          19     A.  I don't know.

          20     Q.  And what prompted this conversation you

          21         think you recall having?

          22     A.  As I remember, Dr. Rosano asked me to

          23         speak with Mr. Davis.  I'm not sure if it

          24         was -- I'm not certain of the situation, the

          25         circumstances surrounding that, but I do

                                                               70



           1         know that I -- my memory is that we spoke.

           2     Q.  What is the position of Dr. Rosano?

           3     A.  At that time he was the director of the

           4         clinical laboratories.

           5     Q.  Did Dr. Rosano have any involvement in

           6         analyzing the sample or speaking with the

           7         Davises?

           8     A.  As I say, he may have spoken with --

           9                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

          10     A.  I'm not certain.  I know he did not have

          11         any direct role in this -- in our report --

          12         other than being administrative head,

          13         so...

          14     Q.  What was the reason that Dr. Rosano asked

          15         you to speak with the Davises?

          16                   MR. BELL:  Objection.  If you

          17             know.

          18     A.  I think he was just -- I think he thought

          19         Mr. Davis was upset and perhaps I could

          20         allay some of his concerns by speaking

          21         with him.  That's my memory.  I don't -- I

          22         don't know that that was, in fact, the

          23         case, but that's what I understood was

          24         happening.

          25     Q.  I take it at the point in time you're

                                                               71



           1         talking about, the tissue, the fetal

           2         remains that we're talking about here, had

           3         already been incinerated?

           4     A.  Yes, sir.

           5     Q.  And with regard to this conversation you

           6         believe you had with Mr. Davis, did you

           7         pick up the phone, dial their number to

           8         call them?

           9     A.  As I remember I was in Dr. Rosano's office

          10         and he had one of his personnel place the

          11         call or else -- I'm not certain how that

          12         call was made.  I'm pretty certain I did

          13         not make a direct call myself.

          14     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, you have before you

          15         Exhibit 9.  Could you please tell us what

          16         it is?

          17     A.  This is material from our manual for our

          18         grossing of specimens and anatomic

          19         pathology.

          20     Q.  What do you mean when you say "grossing of

          21         specimens"?

          22     A.  So we inspect each specimen as it comes in

          23         with our naked eye, that's why that word

          24         "gross" is used as opposed to microscopic,

          25         and we describe the material we receive in

                                                               72



           1         terms of its volume, size, color,

           2         consistency, elements that we can

           3         recognize.  Depending on what's there, if

           4         there's something that's abnormal, we

           5         describe that, and we thereafter take

           6         sections of that material to represent

           7         what we have received, and we put those

           8         into cassettes that we individually label

           9         so that we can know what those sections

          10         are meant to represent.

          11     Q.  Is that the gross description that is

          12         contained on the surgical pathology

          13         report?

          14     A.  That is correct.

          15     Q.  Now, on the surgical pathology report,

          16         Exhibit 4, under gross description -- and

          17         I'll let you get to it -- it says (as

          18         read):  Assigned resident Tony L. Jabbour,

          19         J-a-b-b-o-u-r.  Do you remember who he is?

          20     A.  Yes, sir.

          21     Q.  Who is he?

          22     A.  He is one of our residents training in

          23         pathology, or he was.

          24     Q.  A doctor?

          25     A.  Yes, sir.

                                                               73



           1     Q.  And what was he assigned to do?

           2     A.  Well, I'll preempt it.  The next name

           3         there is Sahar Nozad.  She was also a

           4         resident.  She was the one that did this

           5         gross examination description.  So she

           6         handled the specimen at that level.  The

           7         slide that was generated was given to

           8         Dr. El Jabbour, and he was the resident

           9         that was assigned to sign the case out

          10         with me.

          11     Q.  Okay.  So Dr. El Jabbour just handled the

          12         slide; you saw the slide?

          13     A.  Correct.

          14     Q.  And Dr. Nozad, N-o-z-a-d, handled the

          15         tissue specimen; correct?

          16     A.  That is correct.

          17     Q.  And you never personally handled the

          18         tissue specimen?

          19     A.  That is correct.

          20     Q.  Okay.  So after grossing of the tissue

          21         specimen is done, what -- does the tissue

          22         specimen then go into storage?

          23     A.  The material that we did not put into the

          24         cassette goes back in the container to be

          25         stored.

                                                               74



           1     Q.  Now, Exhibit 9 talks about obstetric

           2         pathology and obstetric fetopsy; correct?

           3     A.  Yes, sir.

           4     Q.  Under obstetrical pathology it talks about

           5         products of conception and specimen

           6         processing and early D and E specimens.

           7         What are D and E?

           8     A.  It's the procedure that is done by the

           9         obstetrician and dilatation or evacuation,

          10         extraction.

          11     Q.  And this just contains a description of

          12         grossing the fetal parts; correct?

          13     A.  Well, the tissue itself.  It may or may

          14         not include fetal parts.

          15     Q.  All right.  And on the next page when it

          16         talks about obstetric fetopsy, what does

          17         that refer to?

          18     A.  Well, if it's after 20 weeks, there's --

          19         The obstetric fetopsy is basically used

          20         for stillbirth, you know, description of

          21         that process.

          22     Q.  When it talks about a specimen processing,

          23         are they referring just to a fetus more

          24         than 20 weeks or to all fetuses?

          25     A.  This is for more than 20 weeks when a

                                                               75



           1         formal autopsy is pursued.

           2     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, before you is Exhibit 6,

           3         which is a letter dated December 23, 2015

           4         from the New York State Department of

           5         Health to Larissa Davis regarding Albany

           6         Medical Center hospital and the Complaint

           7         with an ID number on that exhibit.  Are

           8         you -- Do you have any knowledge of an

           9         investigation conducted by the New York

          10         State Department of Health with regard to

          11         this matter?

          12     A.  I do.

          13     Q.  Were you involved in that or contacted?

          14     A.  I was part of the group that responded to

          15         that.

          16     Q.  Okay.  And when you say you were part of

          17         the group that responded to that, you're

          18         talking about to the Complaint?

          19     A.  Yes.

          20     Q.  And the response or part of the group

          21         responding to that complaint, was that

          22         separate from the ad hoc committee who

          23         conducted an investigation that you told

          24         me about earlier today?

          25     A.  They were linked, but each had its own

                                                               76



           1         dynamic.  The RCA was part of the basis,

           2         as I remember, for our response to New

           3         York State, and yet we dealt with New York

           4         State, you know, in an independent

           5         fashion.

           6     Q.  When you say "the RCA," what are you

           7         referring to?

           8     A.  The root cause analysis, this group of

           9         people that met to try to uncover what

          10         went wrong and what we might do better in

          11         the future.

          12     Q.  The response to the New York State

          13         Department of Health, was that in writing?

          14     A.  I'm not certain.  I know we had

          15         communications with them over the phone.

          16         I believe -- I'm not certain whether there

          17         was a written response or not, but that

          18         was headed up by Ms. Archer and

          19         Dr. Rosano.

          20     Q.  Did you ever figure out the reason why

          21         this tissue, these fetal remains ended up

          22         being incinerated?

          23                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          24             but you can answer.

          25     A.  You know, I think it was human error.  You

                                                               77



           1         know, we -- We handle, you know -- In my

           2         time here, we've handled millions of

           3         specimens and this has never happened.

           4         It's just, you know, human beings make

           5         mistakes.  And obviously there are

           6         repercussions and impacts the people

           7         affected very dramatically, and, you know,

           8         we feel terrible about it.  But somebody

           9         goofed, somebody didn't put -- didn't do

          10         what they were supposed to do.

          11                I'm not certain if he was

          12         distracted or he had some issue with his

          13         own family or what happened, you know, but

          14         I think a mistake was made.  There's no

          15         question about it.  He didn't do what he

          16         was supposed to do, he or she.

          17     Q.  As you or representatives of the medical

          18         center look back and evaluated what went

          19         wrong --

          20                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

          21             You can answer.

          22     BY MR. MILLER:

          23     Q.  -- did you identify areas where you could

          24         have had better control to reduce the

          25         likelihood of something like this

                                                               78



           1         happening?

           2     A.  Well, that was the effort of this root

           3         cause analysis.  And we did, in fact,

           4         identify some ways that we thought might

           5         improve the process.

           6     Q.  Could you tell me what they were?

           7     A.  I wouldn't -- I'm not able to remember

           8         those.

           9     Q.  Well, let me ask you this:  When fetal

          10         remains come into your lab today that are

          11         less than 20 weeks in gestational age and

          12         a special request is made that the fetal

          13         parts are to be turned over to a funeral

          14         home, is the process in place today in the

          15         lab the same or different than the process

          16         was back in 2015?

          17                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          18             but you can answer.

          19     A.  I think there have been changes.  Again,

          20         I'm not prepared to identify all those.  I

          21         know that one of the things we did is --

          22         was rather labor-intensive, but it

          23         involved pulling out every case that was a

          24         product of conception and looking at the

          25         requisition sheet in this interval period

                                                               79



           1         of three weeks to make sure that we didn't

           2         miss any.  So it was an after the fact

           3         measure to be certain that we didn't make

           4         this mistake again.

           5                There were some other aspects of

           6         the ability to communicate the handling of

           7         documentation from the OR, ER, and labor

           8         and delivery, that, you know --

           9     Q.  How is the documentation handled

          10         differently today?

          11     A.  Again, that's outside my bailiwick, and

          12         I'm not sure -- That's why I didn't want

          13         to act like I know.

          14     Q.  Who would know about that?

          15     A.  I don't know.

          16     Q.  Is there anybody from Albany Medical

          17         Center who knows?

          18     A.  I would assume someone in nursing might

          19         have some idea about this, but I don't

          20         know.

          21     Q.  Has the written policy and procedure

          22         changed?

          23     A.  Again, I'm not sure.  I don't know the

          24         answers.

          25     Q.  How did you become aware that these fetal

                                                               80



           1         remains were incinerated?

           2     A.  I'm not certain.  I believe our supervisor

           3         in histology came to me and said that this

           4         had happened.

           5     Q.  I'm sorry.  The supervisor of?

           6     A.  In histology, in this laboratory.

           7     Q.  And who was that?

           8     A.  Doug.  Douglas Weisheit, W-e-i-s-h-e-i-t.

           9     Q.  How did he know this happened?

          10     A.  I don't know.

          11     Q.  What was his position in the lab?

          12     A.  He's a supervisor.

          13     Q.  And what were his duties and

          14         responsibilities at that time?

          15     A.  Oversight of the laboratory operations.

          16     Q.  Did that include making sure that special

          17         requests were honored?

          18     A.  Yes.

          19     Q.  My clients learned of the incineration

          20         from Dr. Clark.  Were you aware of that?

          21     A.  Now that you say it, I think our

          22         discussions led us to the conclusion that

          23         the best way for that information being

          24         delivered was through Dr. Clark, who was

          25         their primary care physician.

                                                               81



           1     Q.  Who made that decision?

           2     A.  I suspect it was under the guidance of

           3         Dr. Rosano.

           4     Q.  Are you aware that the Davises learned

           5         about this and had a conversation with

           6         Dr. Clark only after they made a request

           7         for autopsy?

           8     A.  I did not remember that part.

           9     Q.  Is the reason why nobody from -- Let me

          10         withdraw that.

          11                Dr. Clark, was he an employee of

          12         Albany Med at the time we're talking about

          13         or did he have an independent practice?

          14     A.  I'm not certain of his affiliation with

          15         Albany Med.  It's changed over the years,

          16         so I don't know.

          17     Q.  Was there a reason or is there a reason

          18         why no one from the department of

          19         pathology or no representative of Albany

          20         Med called Mr. or Mrs. Davis and said this

          21         is what happened?

          22     A.  Well, again, I think -- We have a practice

          23         in general in the laboratory that we

          24         believe operates most effectively whereby

          25         the primary clinical physician is the one

                                                               82



           1         to communicate directly with the patients

           2         on information that we have, and that's

           3         our practice.  It works best.  If we

           4         interject ourselves, we can create

           5         confusion.  If there are emotional or

           6         other responses that need to be addressed,

           7         we don't know the patients or their

           8         families.

           9                And so that's the practice that

          10         we've always maintained, and that's what

          11         we thought would be best in this

          12         situation, to communicate, initially at

          13         least, through Dr. Clark.  I think

          14         Dr. Rosano, I believe, felt that perhaps if

          15         I spoke with Mr. Davis or -- and maybe he

          16         did as well, that might also give the

          17         opportunity for them to feedback, voice

          18         concerns, understand our concerns as well

          19         that -- So there was at least some attempt

          20         after Dr. Clark for us to reach out to

          21         them.

          22     Q.  The tissues we're talking about came into

          23         your lab on October 27, 2015?

          24     A.  Correct.

          25     Q.  How long after that October 27th date were

                                                               83



           1         these tissues incinerated?

           2     A.  I do not know that.

           3     Q.  How do you know that these tissues were

           4         incinerated?

           5     A.  Well, we sought them through our storage

           6         facility and we could not find them, so

           7         the assumption was made.  I don't know

           8         that -- it's also possible that they were

           9         checked off.  There was a log process that

          10         we have had for some time.  It's possible

          11         that it was documented in that fashion as

          12         well.  So I don't know.

          13     Q.  Back in this time frame, did Albany

          14         Medical Center, department of pathology

          15         provide tissue samples received in its lab

          16         to any other laboratory outside of Albany

          17         Medical Center?

          18                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

          19             Go ahead.

          20     A.  Only in an effort to do additional testing

          21         as requested by clinicians or as deemed

          22         necessary by us.

          23     Q.  During your tenure at this laboratory,

          24         were surgical remains ever processed for

          25         medical research?

                                                               84



           1     A.  Can you repeat that question?

           2     Q.  Yes.  While you've been with this

           3         laboratory, have medical -- I'm sorry,

           4         have surgical remains been processed for

           5         medical research?

           6                   MR. BELL:  Object to the form,

           7             but go ahead.

           8     A.  Yes.

           9     Q.  Under what circumstances?

          10     A.  Well, with IRB approval for research

          11         purposes to advance understanding of

          12         disease.

          13     Q.  When you say "IRB," what is that?

          14     A.  That's the Institutional Review Board.  So

          15         all such research efforts must go through

          16         that agency for approval recognizing

          17         aspects of ethics and so forth.

          18     Q.  When research of that kind is performed on

          19         tissue of this kind, is permission of the

          20         parents sought?

          21                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

          22             but go ahead.

          23     A.  In some instances, yes, in some instances,

          24         no.  There is, I think, a global

          25         permission that is part of the

                                                               85



           1         documentation that is associated with

           2         entry into the facility.

           3     Q.  Is research -- medical research on tissue

           4         performed with regard to fetal remains?

           5     A.  I'm not aware of that.  It's possible that

           6         there have been IRB protocols that have

           7         deemed that appropriate.  I'm not the

           8         person to ask that question.  I don't know

           9         the answer.

          10     Q.  And IRB, is that an independent body?

          11     A.  The institution has a group of scientists

          12         that function in that role here, at Albany

          13         Med.

          14     Q.  And one of the questions that the Davises

          15         have is, what happened to this tissue?

          16         And they've been told it's been

          17         incinerated.  But in all candor, one of

          18         the concerns that they have is that this

          19         tissue was used in some other way or

          20         processed in some other way or became part

          21         of medical research because there's no

          22         documentation showing them that the tissue

          23         was, in fact, incinerated.

          24                So is there any documentation that

          25         exists anywhere that could satisfy this

                                                               86



           1         concern and inquiry?

           2                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

           3             If you know.

           4     A.  I don't know.  It's possible -- Again, we

           5         did -- We did establish a methodology

           6         whereby we would be certain that it had

           7         been three weeks, at least three weeks

           8         before we disposed of the tissues.  And so

           9         it is possible that that log exists that

          10         would confirm that it was submitted for

          11         disposal.  Beyond that, there would be no

          12         other --

          13                The only other material we have is

          14         that material we use for testing, which

          15         included the glass slide, which we are

          16         required to retain for 20 years and is in

          17         our file, and the paraffin block which

          18         we're also required to retain, but we

          19         offered that for purposes of burial.

          20                So to the best of my knowledge,

          21         there's no one going into our lab and

          22         getting tissues out of storage for

          23         research of this type.  That's not

          24         happening.  I can make a personal

          25         assurance, but that's no documentation.

                                                               87



           1     Q.  You talk about a log relating to disposal

           2         or incineration.

           3     A.  Yeah, I'm not certain there is such a log.

           4         There may or may not be such a log.  I

           5         know we had a method whereby we were

           6         making sure that it had been three weeks

           7         before we disposed of these tissues, and

           8         it's possible that that was associated

           9         with a log.  I'm not certain.

          10     Q.  Okay.  Let me just ask you about this

          11         three-week process again from this

          12         perspective.  A tissue sample comes into

          13         the lab, and if I understand you

          14         correctly, you want to process this tissue

          15         within a couple of days.  And then you

          16         hold on to the sample for three weeks, and

          17         then it can be disposed of at that point

          18         in time.

          19                So you're talking about

          20         three-and-a-half weeks; correct?

          21     A.  Sometimes a little longer.  Depends on how

          22         long it takes us to develop our report.

          23     Q.  Okay.  Do you have any information as to

          24         the earliest time an employee of the lab

          25         or hospital became aware that these

                                                               88



           1         remains were disposed of?

           2     A.  I have no such knowledge.

           3     Q.  The phone call from Dr. Clark to the

           4         Davises came approximately on

           5         December 16th, more than a

           6         month-and-a-half after the sample -- or

           7         the tissue came into the lab, and my

           8         clients have testified that one or both of

           9         them made numerous phone calls to the lab

          10         during the six-week period.  And when they

          11         would be called, they would be passed from

          12         one person to the next person, and that

          13         someone ultimately told Mr. Davis that the

          14         remains were processed.

          15                Do you know anything about that?

          16     A.  No, I do not.

          17     Q.  Does the word "processed" have any special

          18         meaning to you as a pathologist?

          19     A.  I think it means to us that it has been

          20         evaluated and that it's in -- somewhere in

          21         the system as, you know, whether a full

          22         report has been developed or it's in

          23         progress.  It's a fairly broad term.

          24     Q.  Now, back at the time frame we're talking

          25         about, November of 2015.  Was there an

                                                               89



           1         outside vendor that would be used to

           2         dispose of medical waste?

           3     A.  I think -- I think we were using an

           4         outside vendor.

           5     Q.  Do you know if the medical center or your

           6         department would dispose of medical waste

           7         through Albany Medical Center in-house?

           8     A.  We did have that process for a while, but

           9         I think we moved to a different process

          10         before this time frame.

          11     Q.  So the incineration would take place

          12         outside of Albany Medical Center; correct?

          13     A.  I'm not certain.  I believe that's

          14         correct, but I'm by no means the best

          15         person to ask that question.

          16     Q.  I gather that the laboratory handles tens

          17         of thousands of specimens a year; would

          18         that be fair?

          19     A.  Yes, sir.

          20     Q.  So at any given time, in storage for

          21         disposal could be more than a thousand

          22         samples?

          23     A.  Maybe not that many.  I don't know the

          24         answer to that, but probably.  That's a

          25         ballpark figure.

                                                               90



           1     Q.  Or between 500 and 1,000, perhaps?

           2     A.  No.  I don't -- Yeah, we have a limited

           3         storage area and it's usually near

           4         capacity.

           5     Q.  Back in the time frame we're talking

           6         about, when medical waste was going to be

           7         disposed of or incinerated, would this

           8         outside vendor come once a week, come

           9         every day, or with what regularity do they

          10         come?

          11     A.  I think it was two or three times a week.

          12     Q.  And when this outside vendor would come,

          13         and before all these samples that had been

          14         in storage were given to the outside

          15         vendor for disposal, was there any

          16         procedure by which a final check was done

          17         to determine the sample that was being

          18         given should, in fact, be given and was

          19         not attached to any special request?

          20     A.  No, sir, not for a special request.  The

          21         only provision we were operating under was

          22         that it had been at least three weeks

           1             minutes.

           6     BY MR. MILLER:

           7     Q.  Doctor, do you understand that the family

           8         wants to know where these remains went?

           9     A.  I do.

          10     Q.  And tell me what the hospital did to find

          11         out where they went.

          12     A.  Well, I can't speak specifically to that.

          13         I can just tell you in general terms that

          14         our storage facility is such that we would

          15         expect to find that specimen in there if

          16         it were still in our hands, if it had not

          17         been disposed of.  And I believe we did a

          18         hard target search for that and we could

          19         not find it.  And it was in a time frame

          20         when other specimens of that same time

          21         frame would have been disposed of, so...

          22     Q.  So you're assuming that the remains were

          23         disposed of because you can't find it?

          24     A.  Correct.

          25     Q.  But you don't know for sure that these

                                                               92



           1         remains were incinerated or not, do you?

           2     A.  No, sir.

           3                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form,

           4             but go ahead.

           5     BY MR. MILLER:

           6     Q.  And I take it that you don't know for

           7         certain what happened to those remains; is

           8         that correct?

           9     A.  Not for certain.

          10     Q.  Incineration of the remains is an

          11         assumption on your part, isn't it?

          12                   MR. BELL:  Objection to form.

          13             Go ahead.

          14     A.  Well, I think it's -- You know, there are

          15         degrees of confidence that we operate

          16         under in many aspects of our work.  And we

          17         handle -- as you said, we handle thousands

          18         of specimens.  There's almost nowhere else

          19         that that could have gone except for

          20         disposal.  So I'm assuming, but with a

          21         fairly -- or a quite high degree of

          22         confidence that they were disposed of.

          23     Q.  Tell me this, Doctor:  Is there a reason

          24         why nobody from the Medical Center ever

          25         called the Davises after learning that the

                                                               93



           1         remains were missing or incinerated to

           2         apologize to them?

           3     A.  Well, I believe I did that myself.

           4     Q.  I think you said you extended your

           5         condolences.

           6                   MR. BELL:  And -- Well, he said

           7             more than that.  But go ahead.

           8     A.  I believe I said apologize.  I certainly

           9         meant to do that.  I meant to say that,

          10         and that was the intent of the call was to

          11         express our apologies, in part.  So, you

          12         know, I'm hopeful that was received in

          13         that way.  If it was not, then that was

          14         probably due to inadequacy on my part

          15         because that's what the intent was, at

          16         least in part.

          17                I'm not sure if others did as well,

          18         but I thought Dr. Clark did and I thought

          19         I did, and I don't know if others did as

          20         well, but I can't speak to those others, if

          21         anyone else did or did not.

          22     Q.  When a request is made to the IRB for

          23         permission to undertake research, is there

          24         documentation accompanying a request?

          25     A.  Oh, yes.  There's a form -- a formal

                                                               94



           1         request for that, approval.

           2     Q.  And is there -- As opposed to requesting

           3         formal permission, is the specific

           4         identification number for the tissue

           5         you're looking to do research on

           6         identified to the IRB?

           7     A.  No, that would be de-identified.  Any such

           8         case material would be de-identified.

           9         That's a standard.  You can seek special

          10         permission for specific materials if you

          11         have specific approval from that

          12         individual, but by and large, the vast

          13         majority of cases or instances in which

          14         you're seeking approval for research,

          15         materials are de-identified.

          16     Q.  When the research on that tissue for which

          17         permission is sought to do research from

          18         the IRB, what happens to that tissue?

          19     A.  I'm sorry.  I don't understand.

          20     Q.  When the research is completed on that

          21         tissue, what happens to that tissue?

          22     A.  I think that's written up in the protocol

          23         and usually it's disposed of, I believe,

          24         but I'm not sure.  It would depend on the

          25         protocol, I guess.  I'm not involved with

                                                               95



           1         the IRB here, so I don't know what their

           2         standards or requirements are.

           3                   MR. MILLER:  That's all we have.

           4             I appreciate your time.

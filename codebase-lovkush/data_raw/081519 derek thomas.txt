      20                EXAMINATION ON QUALIFICATIONS

      21    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

      22          Q    Good afternoon, Doctor.

      23          A    Hello.

      24          Q    Would you please you introduce yourself

      25    to the jury?


                                                                5






       1          A    I'm Dr. Derek Thomas.

       2          Q    And we are here today to take your

       3    testimony on behalf of one of your patients and

       4    one of my clients, Carlos Hawthorne following his

       5    January 2017 motor vehicle accident.  Any opinions

       6    you formed as an expert in this case as a result

       7    of that treatment and evaluation -- before we get

       8    there, I would like to ask you a couple questions

       9    about your qualifications so the jury understands

      10    why you're here and what your qualifications are.

      11              Can you tell me what type of physician

      12    you are.

      13          A    Orthopedic surgeon.

      14          Q    And what does that mean?

      15          A    Orthopedics is a study of bone and

      16    joint disorders.  In my case, specifically, I only

      17    deal with adult spinal problems.

      18          Q    And can you estimate for me what

      19    percentage of the patients you see require

      20    surgery?

      21          A    Probably -- I see about 120 patients

      22    per week and I do about eight spine surgeries a

      23    week.  But in that 120 patients are mostly

      24    non-operative patients, some are patients we've

      25    already operated on.  So I'm not sure how those


                                                                6






       1    numbers work out but that's what I see.

       2          Q    Fair enough.

       3              Are you licensed to practice in the

       4    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?

       5          A    Yes.

       6          Q    And you told us already you focus on

       7    adult spine surgery.  Can you tell the jury how

       8    you became a surgeon.

       9          A    Sure.  Went to four years of college,

      10    University of Notre Dame.  Medical school at the

      11    Medical College of Virginia followed by a

      12    five-year orthopedic surgery residency in South

      13    Carolina, followed by a one-year adult spine

      14    surgery fellowship at Stanford.  And then returned

      15    to Pittsburgh and started working.

      16          Q    Are you board certified?

      17          A    Yes.

      18          Q    In what specialty?

      19          A    Orthopedics.

      20          Q    What is board certification?

      21          A    Board certification in orthopedics

      22    means at the end of your five years of residency

      23    you have to take a written test.  If you pass the

      24    written test then two years later you take an oral

      25    examination.  And if you pass that then you're


                                                                7






       1    considered board certified.

       2          Q    Have you been published in the field?

       3          A    Yes.

       4          Q    And have you previously been qualified

       5    to testify as an expert witness in Allegheny

       6    County?

       7          A    Yes.

       8          Q    And do you do work for both plaintiff

       9    and defense firms?

      10          A    Yes.

      11          Q    I'm going to show you -- well, please

      12    take a look at the document I've marked as Exhibit

      13    1 in front of you; do you recognize that?

      14          A    Yes, that's my CV.

      15               (Dr. Thomas Deposition Exhibit No. 1

      16            was marked for identification.)

      17    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

      18          Q    And can you tell me a little bit about

      19    your current practice.

      20          A    Current practice is, as I said, 120

      21    patients a week.  About eight surgeries a week.

      22    Mostly -- 99 percent of what I do revolves around

      23    adult spine surgery.

      24          Q    And do you have operating privileges at

      25    any hospitals around here?


                                                                8






       1          A    St. Clair Hospital.

       2          Q    Is that where you primarily practice

       3    now?

       4          A    Yes.

       5          Q    And what kind of procedures do you

       6    perform on a weekly basis?

       7          A    Most common surgeries I do are lumbar

       8    fusions, cervical or neck fusions and lumbar and

       9    microdiscectomies.

      10          Q    And as part of your practice, do you

      11    diagnose and treat patients who have been injured

      12    in auto accidents and other accidents?

      13          A    Yes.

      14          Q    Do you treat people with neck and back

      15    injuries?

      16          A    Yes.

      17          Q    As part of your practice do you

      18    routinely review and rely on medical records and

      19    diagnostic records from other providers?

      20          A    Yes.

      21          Q    And does your training include the

      22    ability to read and evaluate diagnostic records?

      23          A    Yes, it does.

      24          Q    Would that include MRIs?

      25          A    Yes.


                                                                9






       1          MR. FLAHERTY:  Thank you, Doctor, I don't

       2    have any other questions on your qualifications

       3    ,Mr. Olszewski may.

       4          MR. OLSZEWSKI:  Thank you, Doctor, just one

       5    or two questions.

       6             CROSS-EXAMINATION ON QUALIFICATIONS

       7    BY MR. OLSZEWSKI:

       8          Q    I see on your curriculum vitae that you

       9    identified earlier that it lists your employer as

      10    Greater Pittsburgh Orthopaedic Associates.  Are

      11    you still with that organization?

      12          A    No, I moved to St. Clair Orthopedics

      13    three months ago.

      14          Q    So other than that change to your

      15    curriculum vitae, are all the other bits of

      16    information here accurate and correct?

      17          A    Yes.

      18          Q    And the move from Greater Pittsburgh

      19    Orthopaedic Associates to St. Clair Hospital, has

      20    that in any way changed the practice that you do

      21    and the operations that you perform?

      22          A    No.

      23          MR. OLSZEWSKI:  No further questions.  Thank

      24    you.

       1    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

       2          Q    Doctor, at the time of Mr. Hawthorne's

       3    surgery, November of 2017, were you working at

       4    Greater Pittsburgh Orthopaedics?

       5          A    Yes.

       6          MR. FLAHERTY:  Thank you.  I would offer

       7    Dr. Derek Thomas as an expert in the field of

       8    orthopedics and orthopedic surgery.

       9          MR. OLSZEWSKI:  No objection.

      10                      DIRECT EXAMINATION

      11    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

      12          Q    As I mentioned before, we're here to

      13    talk about Carlos Hawthorne and what happened to

      14    him after he was rear ended back in January of

      15    2017.  During your testimony I'm going to ask you

      16    for a couple of opinions today.  So I'm going to

      17    put a qualifier on that; please don't give me any

      18    opinions unless you can do so to a reasonable

      19    degree of medical certainty; is that fair?

      20          A    Yes.

      21          Q    Now, my office asked you to prepare a

      22    narrative report in this case.  Would you take a

      23    look at Exhibit 2 please.

      24               (Dr. Thomas Deposition Exhibit No. 2

      25            was marked for identification.)


                                                               11






       1    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

       2          Q    Is that the report you prepared on

       3    Mr. Hawthorne's behalf?

       4          A    Yes, it is.

       5          Q    When did you first see Carlos.

       6          A    I first met Mr. Hawthorne on

       7    September 22, 2017.

       8          Q    And did you evaluate him, yourself, in

       9    person?

      10          A    Yes.

      11          Q    Were you, in fact, his surgeon?

      12          A    Yes.

      13          Q    And did you perform a physical exam

      14    when you first encountered him?

      15          A    Yes.  When I saw him on that day he

      16    was, I believe, 42 years old.  Reported a motor

      17    vehicle accident of January 23, 2017.  He had told

      18    me he had been through some other nonoperative

      19    treatments.  And so when I saw him we -- on

      20    physical exam that day, basically what he had was

      21    a pretty classic L5-S1 problem towards the left

      22    side.  He had weakness in his plantar flexion, in

      23    other words couldn't stand on his toes

      24    (indicating) on that left side.

      25               He had no ankle jerk reflex on the left


                                                               12






       1    side compared to the right.  Once again,

       2    consistent with a S1 nerve problem.  Positive

       3    straight leg raise test.  Just a basic test we do

       4    to investigate these types of problems.

       5          Q    And how is the straight leg test

       6    performed?

       7          A    He had a positive straight leg raise

       8    test.

       9          Q    How do you perform that test?

      10          A    Should have him lying down, then you

      11    raise the leg up, you get to a certain level and

      12    they start recomplaining of pain which goes down

      13    their leg.

      14          Q    And when he presented to your office,

      15    did you have the benefit of an MRI at that time?

      16          A    Yes.

      17          Q    Can you tell the jury what an MRI is.

      18          A    MRI is magnetic resonance imaging.

      19    It's a wonderful type of image we have that shows

      20    us great anatomical pictures of the spine.  And in

      21    this case, the ones I look at the most are lumbar

      22    and cervical MRIs which show the discs, the

      23    nerves, the bones and potential pinching of

      24    nerves.

      25          Q    Let's start with the conclusion in this


                                                               13






       1    case.  Was he injured in this accident?

       2          A    Yes.

       3          Q    How?

       4          A    I believe he had a herniated disc at

       5    L5-S1 towards the left side.

       6          Q    And is this a surgical case?

       7          A    Well, at first we try to treat most

       8    people nonoperatively, as he went through several

       9    months of trying to treat this nonoperatively, but

      10    if the pain persists and weakness, even some

      11    numbness, loss of reflex, those are all good

      12    surgical indications.

      13          Q    Did you perform surgery on Carlos?

      14          A    Yes.

      15          Q    What kind of procedure?

      16          A    L5-S1 microdiscectomy.

      17          Q    And can you tell the jury what that is.

      18          A    Sure.  So, I'll just go to the model

      19    here.  I will show you the model.  This is a model

      20    of the spine.  What you have here are bones and in

      21    between are discs.  You can see the yellow nerves

      22    coming out the side and -- a disc is like a jelly

      23    doughnut, if you squeeze it hard enough a piece of

      24    jelly can come out through the back and hit on one

      25    of these nerves.


                                                               14






       1               In his case, his disc comes outs of the

       2    left side in the back, hits on the S1 nerve like

       3    this and sends the pain down the back of his left

       4    leg down to his foot.  When that piece of jelly

       5    comes out it impinges upon the nerve.  And when

       6    you do a surgery for this, what we basically do is

       7    the patient is asleep, we flip the patient over,

       8    we make a small incision in the back and then

       9    we'll drill a hole in the bone on this side;

      10    that's called a laminotomy.  Underneath that is

      11    going to be some ligament.  You slowly remove away

      12    the ligament until you see the nerve.  Take the

      13    nerve and pull it to the side and, underneath

      14    that, you should see the piece of herniated disc

      15    sitting there (indicating throughout).

      16          Q    In this case, did you see pieces of

      17    herniated disc sitting there?

      18          A    Yes.

      19          Q    And do you remove that disc?

      20          A    Sure.  You basically -- what happens is

      21    the piece of jelly that comes out basically forms

      22    a little capsule around it and you just pop it

      23    (indicating) and out -- comes out a couple

      24    fragments, maybe one nice big fragment if you're

      25    really lucky, but usually it comes out in two or


                                                               15






       1    three fragments of disc.  And you remove that and

       2    the nerve is able to fall back down to where it's

       3    supposed to be, it gives it more room and people

       4    wake up and feel better.

       5          Q    What is the interplay between

       6    Mr. Hawthorne's symptoms of having difficulty

       7    walking, difficulty sitting and the lack of a

       8    reflex correlated with that lumbar herniation?

       9          A    So an L5-S1 herniation usually, as I

      10    said, describes pain in the back, pain in the

      11    buttock area, pain down the leg; it can be

      12    numbness and tingling; it can be a loss of reflex

      13    like he has.  In other words, the nerve is pinched

      14    and you do not get your normal reflexes like

      15    you're supposed to have.  People with herniated

      16    discs often will have the leg symptoms, they can

      17    often have back pain.  A lot of these people have

      18    trouble sitting.  The way I describe them as,

      19    they're very fidgety people, in other words they

      20    can't sit very long, can't stand very long, really

      21    can't walk very long either.  They're kind of

      22    always of moving around because nothing is very

      23    comfortable for them.

      24          Q    I would like to look the at actual MRI

      25    in this case.  Did you use the films yourself?


                                                               16






       1          A    Yes.

       2          Q    Okay.

       3          MR. FLAHERTY:  Off the record please.

       4          VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off record.  The time

       5    on screen is 5:28.

       6          (Brief recess from 5:28 p.m. - 5:29 p.m.)

       8    5:29.

       9    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

      10          Q    Doctor, what are we looking at here?

      11          A    This is called -- this is a

      12    cross-section of the lumbar spine at L5-S1.  In

      13    other words, cross-section means if we cut you off

      14    and look down at you or really look up at you,

      15    but -- and what you see here is, there's our disc,

      16    kind of like a jelly doughnut, dark on the

      17    outside, kind of jelly in the middle.

      18               These are your nerves back here, the

      19    little black things bathing in white spinal fluid.

      20    This is the left side.  That's the right.  And if

      21    we come down one frame you can see a piece of disc

      22    that's come out this side over here impinging upon

      23    the nerves on this side, versus the nerve on the

      24    right side has plenty of room.  So that's a pretty

      25    classic herniated disc towards the left side


                                                               17






       1    (indicating throughout).

       2          Q    And are those nerves the nerves you

       3    showed us on the model that go down the legs?

       4          A    Correct.  The S1 nerve begins right

       5    about there (indicating).

       6          Q    And with that nerve, where should --

       7    where would a classic presentation of pathology

       8    present?

       9          A    Pretty much how I described it, back

      10    pain, buttock pain, back of the leg pain, kind of

      11    your hamstring area down to your calf.  And if it

      12    gets really specific, as I said, you can start

      13    losing some strength or even a reflex on that

      14    side.

      15          Q    Thank you.

      16          MR. FLAHERTY:  Off the record.

      17          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off record.  The

      18    time is 5:30.

      19          (Brief recess from 5:30 p.m. - 5:31 p.m.)

      20          VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on record.  Time is

      21    5:31.

      22    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

      23          Q    Doctor, you mentioned when he first

      24    presented to you in September he had already gone

      25    through some nonoperative care.  Could you tell


                                                               18






       1    the jury what kind of treatment he had?

       2          A    He had told me he had been through some

       3    chiropractic treatments for several months.  Had

       4    had at least one, I think, maybe two epidural

       5    injections or steroid injections in the back.

       6          Q    What are the goal of those treatments?

       7          A    Well, about 60 percent of herniated

       8    discs will just get better if you treat them

       9    nonoperatively.  That still leaves about 30 or 40

      10    percent that don't get better.  Chiropractic

      11    treatments, epidural injections are all there to

      12    try to help with the pain and the symptoms in

      13    hopes that the body will just continue to get

      14    better over time.

      15          Q    And is that -- is the standard of care

      16    prior to these operations to try some

      17    nonoperative --

      18          A    Yes.

      19          Q    -- interventions?

      20          A    Yes.

      21          Q    Okay.  What -- what's significant about

      22    the loss of reflex in the leg?

      23          A    It's just a sign that you see on

      24    physical exam that the nerve is pinched.  If it's

      25    pinched for a while, it doesn't even have to be


                                                               19






       1    that long, but people can lose the reflex, it's

       2    just something we look for on physical exam.

       3          Q    Okay.  And when you first saw him did

       4    you schedule the surgery right after that initial

       5    operation -- or after the initial visit?

       6          A    I believe we did, yes.

       7          Q    Okay.

       8          A    Because his surgery was then done on

       9    November 6th.

      10          Q    And where is -- where do you perform

      11    these surgeries?

      12          A    This surgery was done, I believe, at

      13    St. Clair Hospital.

      14          Q    Is the patient put under?

      15          A    Yes, they are asleep.

      16          Q    And when you remove that fragment, is

      17    that you in there with a knife physically?

      18          A    Yes.

      19          Q    Okay.  So this isn't a laser procedure

      20    or anything like this, you physically open them

      21    up?

      22          A    Correct.

      23          Q    Are there stitches involved?  Is there

      24    a scar involved?

      25          A    Yeah, a scar for a guy like him is


                                                               20






       1    probably about an inch, maybe an inch and a

       2    quarter.  The stitches are all put under the skin.

       3          Q    And immediately postoperatively what

       4    does this mean for Mr. Hawthorne's life?  What's

       5    his recovery like?

       6          A    Most people that you do the surgery on,

       7    if you've chosen the patient well and they have an

       8    MRI like that, they should feel an instant change.

       9    They should know it from the moment they wake up,

      10    they should feel some difference, at least a

      11    decrease in their leg pain.  The back usually is

      12    pretty sore just from where we cut them for at

      13    least, you know, two, three weeks.

      14               As far as recovery, most people who

      15    have a labor job we likely will not let them to

      16    get back to heavy labor for about eight weeks, two

      17    months, somewhere in there.  If they have some

      18    sort of desk job or light-duty job they can

      19    probably get back sooner than that.

      20          Q    And did you take Carlos off of work?

      21          A    Yes.

      22          Q    I saw a note in your file that he can

      23    return the 22nd of November.  Does that sound

      24    right to you?

      25          A    Yes.


                                                               21






       1          Q    Okay.  Is that typical for someone who

       2    has a desk-type job?

       3          A    Yes, I think that's pretty good.  Yeah,

       4    that's maybe a little earlier than some of our

       5    patients but, yeah, two weeks is great.

       6          Q    Okay.  And do you have an opinion as to

       7    the cause of the injuries you told us about

       8    earlier?

       9          A    I do believe it does date back to the

      10    motor vehicle accident, January of 2017.

      11          Q    And do you hold that opinion to a

      12    reasonable degree of medical certainty?

      13          A    Yes.

      14          Q    Has the treatment that Carols

      15    Hawthorne's had to date, including the surgery,

      16    been reasonable and necessary?

      17          A    Yes.

      18          Q    And have you given us all of your

      19    opinions today to a reasonable degree of medical

      20    certainty?

      21          A    Yes.

      22          MR. FLAHERTY:  Thank you Doctor, I don't

      23    have anything further for you.

      24          MR. OLSZEWSKI:  I do have a few questions.

      25                      CROSS-EXAMINATION


                                                               22






       1    BY MR. OLSZEWSKI:

       2          Q    Doctor, let me ask you a little bit

       3    about your evaluation of Mr. Hawthorne.  I know

       4    that you've indicated to us here in the room and

       5    the jury that you believe that Mr. Hawthorne's

       6    need for the surgery was related to the January

       7    23, 2017, accident.  Have I accurately summarized

       8    what you've told us today?

       9          A    Yes.

      10          Q    Now, what information did you have on

      11    the accident, was it only from Mr. Hawthorne or

      12    for from some other source?

      13          A    Yes, Mr. Hawthorne.

      14          Q    And based on the description of what

      15    Mr. Hawthorne told you, that is the basis for you

      16    to say that the surgery that he had to undergo was

      17    related to that event?

      18          A    Yes.

      19          Q    Is that typical that you would base

      20    your medical opinion on what the patient tells

      21    you?

      22          A    Yes.

      23          Q    Do you not need to review records or

      24    anything of that nature to give you, I guess, more

      25    of a basis for your opinion on that point?


                                                               23






       1          A    Sometimes it's nice to but not always.

       2    I mean, we try to listen to our patients a best we

       3    can and try to believe them as best we can.

       4          Q    Did you ask Mr. Hawthorne if he did

       5    anything else between January 23 and 2017, and

       6    when you saw him on September 22 that would have

       7    impacted his back in any way?

       8          A    He did not report anything.

       9          Q    Did you ask him?

      10          A    I'm sure we discussed things, I don't

      11    have it written down in any notes.  But he did go

      12    through the chiropractic and epidural injections

      13    which is pretty typical for most people.

      14          Q    But do you have a recollection of

      15    asking him if he did anything to his back after

      16    January 23, 2017, until you first saw him on

      17    September 22?

      18          A    No.

      19          Q    Okay.

      20              So then Mr. Hawthorne comes to you after

      21    receiving some therapy, and you've described that

      22    in general today.  Just so I understand,

      23    Mr. Hawthorne was working when he came to see you

      24    on September 22, 2017, was he not?

      25          A    Yes.


                                                               24






       1          Q    He works in an office setting; is that

       2    correct?

       3          A    Yes.

       4          Q    And was able to return to work, do you

       5    recall that being sometime in March of 2017?

       6          A    We had -- I believe I released him back

       7    to full duty in November of 2017.

       8          Q    No, I understand.  But what I was

       9    asking -- and maybe you don't have that in your

      10    notes there and I understand that.

      11              But were you aware then that

      12    Mr. Hawthorne was released to do his

      13    time-of-injury job -- I think there was some

      14    accommodations made -- but he was released to his

      15    time-of-injury job as of March 2017.

      16          A    I know that he was working when I did

      17    see him, so that makes sense, yeah.

      18          Q    Okay.  All right.

      19              And I suppose that someone with the

      20    condition that you've described, the herniation,

      21    they can work; is that right?

      22          A    A lot of times, yes.

      23          Q    And I think that you've told us in a

      24    lot of cases, 60 percent, I think was your number,

      25    those people with herniations do not require


                                                               25






       1    surgery, they can recover without the need for

       2    surgery?

       3          A    Yes, definitely.

       4          Q    And was Mr. Hawthorne's problem, the

       5    area that you've shown us on the video screen, was

       6    that a problem that could resolve without surgery?

       7          A    Some do, yes.

       8          Q    In this case you thought surgery was

       9    the appropriate way to go?

      10          A    Yes.

      11          Q    And you performed the surgery as you've

      12    done on many, many other patients, I understand?

      13          A    Yes.

      14          Q    Do you do the surgery that you

      15    performed on Mr. Hawthorne on a monthly, weekly

      16    basis?  I mean, how often do you do that type of

      17    surgery?

      18          A    Every week.

      19          Q    I know no surgeries are routine, but is

      20    it a surgery that you're very familiar with?

      21          A    Yes.

      22          Q    When you were doing the surgery, when

      23    you were performing the operation as you've

      24    described for us today, did you see anything else

      25    in there that would have caused you to be


                                                               26






       1    concerned about Mr. Hawthorne's ability to

       2    recover, I won't say fully, but to a large degree

       3    from the procedure?

       4          A    No.

       5          Q    And I think that you've told us today

       6    and you've written it in some documentation, that

       7    Mr. Hawthorne did make a very good recovery from

       8    the surgery?

       9          A    Yes.

      10          Q    So when you last saw him in November of

      11    2017, you released him to return to his

      12    time-of-injury job?

      13          A    Yes, I did.

      14          Q    And I understand that that release was

      15    without restrictions; is that correct?

      16          A    Correct.

      17          Q    I also understand that you saw

      18    Mr. Hawthorne back in your office on July 10,

      19    2018, the following year; is that correct?

      20          A    Yes.

      21          Q    And why did you see him back the

      22    following year?  Did you think there would be a

      23    problem or was this just a follow-up, your

      24    routine, why did you see him again?

      25          A    He came back to see us.


                                                               27






       1          Q    Okay.  And when you saw Mr. Hawthorne

       2    on July 10, 2018, was he, again, in good shape and

       3    there were no problems noted?

       4          A    That's what he reported, yes.

       5          Q    As of July 10, 2018, did you see

       6    anything in Mr. Hawthorne's exam or any

       7    descriptions that he provided you which would

       8    indicate that he could not continue working in his

       9    time-of-injury capacity?

      10          A    No.

      11          Q    Did you make any follow-up or schedule

      12    any follow-up appointments for Mr. Hawthorne after

      13    July 10?

      14          A    No.

      15          Q    Was he only to come back to you if he

      16    had a problem?

      17          A    Yes.

      18          Q    And as of today, when you're providing

      19    us with your testimony, has Mr. Hawthorne been

      20    back to see you?

      21          A    No.

      22          Q    Would that indicate to you that he is

      23    recovered from the problems that you treated him

      24    for?

      25          A    Hopefully, he's doing well, yes.


                                                               28






       1          Q    Were you happy with the surgery that

       2    you performed?

       3          A    Yeah, his was great.

       4          Q    Okay.  Is this the result that you like

       5    to see in a lot of your patients?

       6          A    Yeah, I would love to.  Yes.

       7          Q    Okay.  So this was a very positive

       8    result --

       9          A    Yes.

      10          Q    -- that Mr. Hawthorne received --

      11          A    Yeah, surgery was simple, recovery was

      12    easy.  Pain went away quickly.

      13          Q    Does it help in Mr. Hawthorne's case

      14    that he's a fairly young man --

      15          A    Well --

      16          Q    -- 42 years old.  Does that impact in

      17    the positive?

      18          A    No.  No.  I think the younger people do

      19    worse.  The older the patient the better.

      20          Q    Oh, okay.  But whatever the case, in

      21    Mr. Hawthorne's situation, the result was great,

      22    he's back to work and you're not seeing him any

      23    further; is that correct?

      24          A    Correct.

      25          Q    Doctor, if Mr. Hawthorne had complaints


                                                               29






       1    about, you know, ongoing problems, in your mind

       2    that would not be related to your surgery would

       3    it?

       4          A    No, I wouldn't think so.

       5          Q    And did you put any limitations,

       6    Doctor, on Mr. Hawthorne's ability to drive or

       7    walk?

       8          A    For the first couple weeks we ask that

       9    they not drive.  We encourage them to walk every

      10    day.  But after we put them back to work, no, no

      11    restrictions.

      12          Q    And would that be the same for -- I

      13    know he's got a very large dog, 130 pounds or

      14    something -- any restrictions on ability to take

      15    care of his dog?

      16          A    No.

      17          Q    And obviously no restrictions on his

      18    ability to work?

      19          A    Correct.

      20          Q    Doctor, would you have released

      21    Mr. Hawthorne to work and the activities that you

      22    mentioned if you were uncomfortable with his

      23    recovery in any way?

      24          A    I may have held him a little bit

      25    longer, sure.  I mean, I'm very happy when


                                                               30






       1    patients comes in after two weeks and say they

       2    want to go back to work; that's great.

       3          Q    Right.

       4          A    I have a lot of people, even with desk

       5    jobs who still even take three, four, five, six

       6    weeks; just depends on what their desk job is.

       7    You know, some people are really stuck in a desk

       8    and that probably doesn't feel too great for eight

       9    or ten hours a day but...  No, but if they come in

      10    and, at two weeks, if this -- a gentleman like

      11    this says they can go back, sure, that's great.

      12          Q    You were happy with that result?

      13          A    Yes.

      14          Q    And you're happy to accommodate him?

      15          A    Yes.

      16          Q    Doctor, you mentioned that you

      17    thought -- last, last topic area -- you thought

      18    that all of the care that Mr. Hawthorne had

      19    received up to the point when you saw him in

      20    September was reasonable and necessary, I think

      21    you said something to that effect?

      22          A    Yes.

      23          Q    How close did you look at that

      24    procedure to come up with that opinion?  Did you

      25    have all the records in front of you?  Did you


                                                               31






       1    scour that to determine what was necessary and not

       2    necessary?

       3          A    The general progression of things after

       4    a herniated disc, most patients you will see

       5    usually go through some form of physical therapy,

       6    some form of -- and/or chiropractic treatment.  A

       7    lot will have at least one, if not two injections.

       8    So that's pretty standard.

       9               So when I did review the records that

      10    were given to me to look at these things, I mean,

      11    it all seemed pretty reasonable as far as how you

      12    would treat people nonoperatively who just come

      13    into the office.

      14          Q    And Doctor, was there any chance in

      15    this case that Mr. Hawthorne could have gotten to

      16    the point where he is now without the surgery that

      17    you performed?

      18          A    I think it's probably unlikely.  You

      19    know, he's a classic example of someone who has,

      20    you know, quote/unquote failed nonoperative

      21    treatment.  You know, they come to see you three,

      22    four, five, six months after the pain begins.

      23    They've been through nonoperative things.  They

      24    start progressing -- unfortunately he was starting

      25    to get some weakness in his leg and those are the


                                                               32






       1    good people to operate on.

       2          MR. OLSZEWSKI:  Okay.  I think those are all

       3    of my questions, Doctor.  Thank you very much for

       4    your time today.

       5          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

       6          MR. FLAHERTY:  Just one follow up for you.

       7                     REDIRECT EXAMINATION

       8    BY MR. FLAHERTY:

       9          Q    Why do you ask them not to drive after

      10    the surgery?

      11          A    For the first two weeks we ask people

      12    not to drive usually because we write them for

      13    some narcotic medication afterwards and it's just

      14    easier to tell people no driving for two weeks.

      15          MR. FLAHERTY:  Fair enough.  That's all I

      16    have.

      17          MR. OLSZEWSKI:  Nothing further.  Thank you

      18    Doctor.

      19          THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

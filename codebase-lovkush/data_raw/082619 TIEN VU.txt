          15   Q.     Did you have insurance on that car?

          16   A.     Yes, I did.

          17   Q.     Back at the time of this accident, did

          18   you have a job?

          19   A.     At the time, I was laid off.

          20   Q.     What kind of job were you laid off

          21   from?

          22               THE INTERPRETER:  I want to

          23   correct this in my misunderstanding him.

          24               Mr. Vu is saying he was not laid

           1   off from a job at the time.  He suffered from

           2   a stroke.

           3   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

           4   Q.     When did you have a stroke?

           5   A.     June 2016.

           6   Q.     What part of your body was affected by

           7   the stroke?

           8               THE INTERPRETER:  I want to

           9   clarify.  Mr. Vu is pointing to his right leg

          10   and his right arm, but he's speaking

          11   Vietnamese left leg.

          12               Do you need the interpreter to

          13   clarify?

          14               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Okay, let's

          15   clarify.

          16               THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, I

          17   pointed at the right side, so it's my right

          18   side.  Now, it's getting better because I

          19   took medication.

          20   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          21   Q.     When did it start getting better?

          22   A.     I did not pay attention.  I just feel

          23   that I get better.  I can walk.

          24   Q.     How long has it been since you could

                                                           13



           1   walk?

           2   A.     I remember in 2018.

           3   Q.     In 2018, you were able to walk again?

           4   A.     Yes, walk and stand normally.

           5   Q.     Before 2018, you weren't able to walk

           6   or stand normally because of the stroke?

           7   A.     No, I still could walk and stand at

           8   the time, but I felt weaker.  At the time of

           9   the accident, I feel pain on both my

          10   shoulder, my lower back.  I have my own

          11   accident when I admit to the ER room, but the

          12   hospital didn't accept my insurance and they

          13   want the insurance from me.

          14   Q.     But let me go back.  You said after

          15   your stroke, which was earlier in 2016,

          16   correct?

          17   A.     Yes.

          18   Q.     Because of the stroke in 2016, your

          19   right arm and right leg and right side were

          20   all weakened from that; is that right?

          21               THE INTERPRETER:  I still need to

          22   relay what he said, but it doesn't relate on

          23   the question.

          24               He said after the accident he

           1   went to the physical therapy, and he got the

           2   injection, three injections.

           3   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

           4   Q.     I'm talking just about your stroke

           5   right now.

           6   A.     My stroke is just normal, nothing.

           7   Q.     Listen.  The stroke that you had was

           8   before this accident; is that right?

           9   A.     June 2016.  The accident happened in

          10   December 2016.  After the accident, I admit

          11   to the therapy, and they got me three shots.

          12   I want one more shot, a fourth one, and they

          13   refused me to give a fourth shot.

          14               THE INTERPRETER:  Do you need to

          15   remind him to only answer the question.

          16   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          17   Q.     Listen to my question and try to

          18   answer just my question, okay?  We'll talk

          19   about the accident in a minute, but I'm

          20   talking about the stroke.

          21   A.     Okay.

          22   Q.     The stroke in June of 2016 affected

          23   your right side?

          24   A.     No.

           8   Q.     Sir, do you remember in the beginning

           9   of the deposition when I told you, if you

          10   didn't understand a question, to let me know?

          11   A.     Yes.  It's a mistake.  That's why I

          12   didn't fully understand your question.

          13   Q.     Are you telling me that from the

          14   beginning of the deposition you have not

          15   understood my questions?

          16   A.     I just understood the questions you

          17   ask.

          19   asked?

          20   A.     No.

          21   Q.     When you were pointing to the right

          22   side of your body as being affected by the

          23   stroke, was that a misunderstanding, as well?

          24   A.     What did you mean?  I don't

                                                           16



           1   understand.

           2   Q.     You tell me.  You told me two minutes

           3   ago that you understood my questions, and

           4   then you said you didn't understand my

           5   questions.  I'm trying to figure out which

           6   one it is.

           7   A.     What do you mean?  What do you want to

           8   say?

           9   Q.     What I'm trying to get is the truth

          10   out of you, sir.  I need you to tell me the

          11   truth.

          12   A.     I was telling you the truth.

          13   Q.     The truth was that in June of 2016,

          14   when you had a stroke, your whole right side

          15   was weakened, right?

          16   A.     Yes, that's right.

          17   Q.     You were weakened in that side until

          18   2018 when you were able to walk like normal?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     It wasn't until 2018 when you were

          21   able to stand like normal?

          22   A.     I don't understand this.

          23   Q.     You told me earlier in this deposition

          24   you weren't able to walk or stand like normal

                                                           17



           1   from the stroke until 2018.

           2          Was that the truth, or no?

           3   A.     Yes.

           4   Q.     That was the truth?

           5   A.     Yes, right now I'm normal.

           6   Q.     The car that you had back in 2016, did

           7   that have handicap plates on it for any

           8   reason?

           9   A.     No.

          10               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Counsel, is

          11   there any wage loss claim, loss of earning

          12   capacity claim?

          19   Q.     Did you have a health card?

          20   A.     Yes, I do.

          22   Q.     Did you see anyone have a conversation

          23   with the driver of the other car?

          24   A.     No, I didn't know anything.

                                                           23



           1   Q.     Did you ever get out of the car at the

           2   scene of the accident before the ambulance

           3   came?

           4   A.     I can't recall.  Probably somebody

           5   carry me out and check on me to the

           6   ambulance.

           7   Q.     After you went to the emergency room,

           8   did they release you?

           9   A.     Yes, I was released from the hospital

          10   after they took some x-ray on the back of my

          11   neck.  I gave them my insurance, and they did

          12   not accept my insurance.  They want insurance

          13   from Minh and the other driver, and I didn't

          14   have it.  They released me, and I had to call

          15   my friend to come and pick me up.

          16   Q.     Who's your friend?

          17   A.     Mr. Pham.  Mr. Pham told me to wait at

          18   the hospital.  He took Minh to the

          19   immigration.  After that, he will come back

          20   and pick me up.

          21   Q.     When the accident happened, were you

          22   bleeding at all afterwards?

          23   A.     I did not pay attention.  I don't

          24   recall.

                                                           24



           1   Q.     Did you hit anything inside the car?

           2   A.     Yes, because after the impact, I

           3   jerked forward and then backward.  If you ask

           4   me if I bleed, I didn't recall that.  You

           5   have to get the information from the

           6   ambulance.

           7   Q.     Sir, just a couple minutes ago you

           8   told me you didn't feel anything.

           9          Now, you're telling me you were jolted

          10   forward and backward.  Which one is it?

          11               MR. KELLY:  I'm going to object.

          12   I think they're two different questions.

          13               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  He said he

          14   didn't feel anything.  If you don't feel

          15   anything, how are you moving forward and

          16   backwards?

          17               MR. KELLY:  You can answer.

          18               THE WITNESS:  Because the earlier

          19   question you posed to me asking if I see --

          20   if I saw anything.

          21   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          22   Q.     Then I asked you if you felt anything.

          23   You said you did not feel anything.

          24          Are you saying you didn't say that?

                                                           25



           1   A.     You have to explain to me the

           2   question.  If you just ask me did I feel

           3   anything, I don't understand your question.

           4   Q.     Well, then you're supposed to tell me

           5   that you don't understand the question, not

           6   answer it.  I told you that three times now,

           7   sir.  I'm not sure what's funny.

           8          Now, you're speaking English, sir.

           9   I'm trying to find out what's going on here,

          10   sir.  If you understand me talking to you

          11   right now, it doesn't matter what the

          12   interpreter says.

          13          Are you saying that the interpreter is

          14   not saying what I'm saying?

          15   A.     If I fully understand English, I don't

          16   need you to do the interpretation for me.

          17   But if you translate for me, do

          18   interpretation for me, you have to interpret

          19   in detail so that I understand.

          20   Q.     Well, sir, I don't know how else to

          21   ask you if you felt anything other than

          22   asking you did you feel anything.

          23          How else would you like me to explain

          24   how do you feel?

                                                           26



           1   A.     I want you to ask me how do I feel

           2   with my body or about outside the car.

           3   Q.     The question was to you, sir, you

           4   didn't see anything, but did you feel

           5   anything.  Your answer to me was that you did

           6   not feel anything.  Then at a later question

           7   you tell me that you moved forward and

           8   backward.

           9          Are you telling me that when you moved

          10   forward and backward that you didn't feel

          11   that?

          12   A.     I misunderstood your question because

          13   I thought that the first question you posed

          14   and the one that you're posing later is the

          15   same.

          16   Q.     The one I said before and later is the

          17   same, and you gave me two different answers.

          18   A.     You asked me the first question that

          19   if I saw anything, so I told you that I did

          20   not see anything.  Then you asked me if I

          21   felt anything, and I say I didn't feel

          22   anything.  How do you want me to answer?

          23   Q.     I just want you to tell me the truth,

          24   sir.

                                                           27



           1   A.     I'm telling you the truth.

           2   Q.     After Mr. Pham picked you up from the

           3   hospital, what did you do then?

           4   A.     I didn't do anything.  I went back

           5   home.

           6   Q.     When you went home, what is the next

           7   time you called anybody or went anywhere for

           8   treatment for any injury?

           9   A.     If you pose a question like that, I

          10   can't recall it.

          11   Q.     When was the first time you went to

          12   any treatment?

          13   A.     I want to ask you before I can answer

          14   you, to go to treatment, is that for physical

          15   therapy or for my personal illness?

          16   Q.     For physical therapy.  Let's try that

          17   first.

          18   A.     For the physical therapy, I can't

          19   recall.  I just remember that I went there

          20   all together with my three other friends.

          21   Q.     The two other people in the car,

          22   Mr. Pham and Mr. Nguyen?

          23   A.     Yes, Tien drive his car and take us

          24   there.

           1   Q.     How did you know you were going to

           2   therapy?

           3               THE INTERPRETER:  May you repeat

           4   the question?

           5   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

           6   Q.     Who told you to go to therapy?

           7   A.     I don't understand what you mean who

           8   told me to go to therapy.

           9   Q.     Did someone say you had to go to

          10   therapy?

          11   A.     Yes, my lawyer right here told me to

          12   go to treatment at physical therapy.

          13   Q.     Did you ever go to any other doctor

          14   between the time of the emergency room and

          15   when you went to therapy for anything?

          16   A.     Seek treatment for what?  I want to

          17   know for therapy or my personal illness.

          18   Q.     From the time Mr. Pham picked you up

          19   from the emergency room until the time you

          20   first went to physical therapy, did you see

          21   any other doctors between those two times for

          22   anything?

          23   A.     I have to know which doctor you want

          24   to know because I can't tell you now or I

                                                           29



           1   give you different answers.

           2   Q.     I just said a doctor for anything.

           3          Any doctor for anything, did you see

           4   any one from the time Mr. Pham picked you up

           5   from the emergency room until the first time

           6   you went to physical therapy?

           7   A.     You're asking me from the time that I

           8   was picked up from the ER to the time that I

           9   first went to visit the physical therapy or

          10   are you asking me before then?

          11   Q.     I don't know how other clear way I can

          12   say this.

          13          From the time that Mr. Pham picked you

          14   up from the emergency room until the time you

          15   went to physical therapy for the first time,

          16   did you see any doctor for anything anywhere

          17   anyhow?

          18   A.     No.

          19   Q.     Do you have a family doctor?

          20   A.     Yes, I do.  Vangore on US 1 Roosevelt.

          21   Q.     Did you ever see Dr. Vangore at any

          22   time after this accident from the day of the

          23   accident until today?

          24   A.     No, I cancelled.  I said then I have

                                                           30



           1   change three to four doctors.

           2   Q.     Have you told any of those three to

           3   four doctors about this accident?

           4   A.     No.

           5   Q.     Why not?

           6   A.     Because I think that the accident I

           7   was involved in doesn't have anything that

           8   have to do with the primary doctors.

           9   Q.     You don't think that any of your

          10   injuries have anything to do with the primary

          11   doctor?  Did I understand that right?

          12   A.     No, it doesn't because I don't

          13   understand what you want to know.

          14   Q.     I want to know if you told any of your

          15   family doctors about any injuries from this

          16   accident.

          17   A.     I did not tell them because, even

          18   though I told them about the accident, I

          19   don't think they can do anything to help.

          20   Q.     Did you tell them about the accident

          21   or didn't you?

          22          Now, you're telling me you told them

          23   about the accident, but two minutes ago

          24   you're saying you did not.

                                                           31



           1   A.     I just asked you to ask or pose a

           2   question that related only to the accident

           3   because this is my privacy and how to answer.

           4   Q.     I'm allowed to ask these questions and

           5   if I wasn't allowed --

           6   A.     I want you to tell her that only ask

           7   or pose a question related to the accident

           8   only because this is my privacy.

           9   Q.     Are you refusing to answer questions?

          10               MR. KELLY:  Can you tell him from

          11   me, from his attorney, that the attorney has

          12   a right to the answer to these questions, for

          13   him to answer.  She's not asking him

          14   questions about his illnesses.  She's just

          15   asking him about --

          16               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Well, I may.

          17               MR. KELLY:  You may, but the

          18   question just related to whether or not he

          19   told those doctors about the accident.

          20   That's what the question is related to.

          21               THE WITNESS:  I don't want to

          22   answer.

          23   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          24   Q.     Are you refusing to answer any

                                                           32



           1   questions about your medical history?

           2   A.     Yes, I will answer.

           3   Q.     The question is, did you tell your

           4   family doctor about the accident, or did you

           5   not?

           6   A.     No, I did not.

           7   Q.     Did you tell them about any pain you

           8   were feeling in your neck and low back?

           9   A.     No, I did not.

          10   Q.     Were you being treated by your family

          11   doctor for any kind of illness?

          12   A.     I want to ask, do you mean I got the

          13   treatment?  What does that mean?

          14   Q.     Have you been treating with your

          15   family doctor for the stroke?

          16   A.     My stroke was treated at the hospital.

          17   It doesn't relate to any family doctor.

          18   Q.     Your stroke was at the hospital.

          19          Did you see any other doctors for the

          20   stroke issues after the hospital?

          21   A.     No.

          22   Q.     Did you ever tell the doctors who were

          23   treating you at physical therapy for this

          24   accident about your stroke?

                                                           33



           1   A.     I don't understand.

           2   Q.     When you were going to treatment for

           3   this accident with Mr. Pham and Mr. Nguyen,

           4   did you ever tell those doctors about your

           5   stroke?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Why not?

           8   A.     I don't remember.  That's why I didn't

           9   tell them.

          10   Q.     You didn't remember you had a stroke

          11   less than six months before the accident?

          12   A.     I meant that I don't remember about

          13   the doctor, not I don't remember the stroke.

          14   Q.     Did you tell any of the doctors that

          15   you were treating with for this accident

          16   about your stroke or any results from the

          17   stroke, any physical disabilities from the

          18   stroke?

          19   A.     No, I did not.

          20   Q.     Every time you went to physical

          21   therapy was Mr. Pham and Mr. Nguyen with you?

          22   A.     Yes, that's right.

          23   Q.     Were you only being treated for issues

          24   for your neck and low back?

                                                           34



           1   A.     Yes, I got treatment for my lower

           2   back, my neck and shoulders.

           3   Q.     Which shoulder?  Both shoulders?

           4   A.     Both shoulders and my back.  I told

           5   them that I have pain on my shoulder, and I

           6   was referred to a hospital somewhere and I

           7   got shots.  If you want more information

           8   about that, you should call the therapy

           9   center.

          10               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Counsel, do you

          11   have any records of any injections?

          12               MR. KELLY:  I can't remember if I

          13   saw them in the report.

          14               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  I don't have any

          15   records of them.  Whether there is a report

          16   of them, that's one thing, but I don't have

          17   any actual records of him actually getting

          18   any shots.

          19               MS. KATHOPOULIS:  I also have no

          20   records of any injections.

          21               MR. KELLY:  I don't remember

          22   seeing the injection records.  I don't

          23   remember if it was in Brady's report or not.

          20   A.     I remember that, after I got treatment

          21   the three times at the therapy center, I

          22   stopped feeling pain because the therapist

          23   got me massage on my shoulder.

           1   correctly.

           2          After two or three times of treatment,

           3   the pain in your shoulder went away?

           4   A.     I don't recall how many times I got

           5   treatment over there.  After I stop feeling

           6   pain, he give me massage.  I start feeling

           7   pain after massage.  After I told him that,

           8   he referred me to see another doctor to give

          10   Q.     Do you know when you got injections,

          11   sir?

          14          Where did they put the needles?

          15   A.     Right here.

          16   Q.     In your neck or shoulder?

          17   A.     I can't remember because I know it's

          18   at the back right here.  I was told that they

          19   give injection to the vein.

          20   Q.     Through the vein?

          21   A.     The vein, so I can't recall.  If you

          22   want to know, you can call her.

          23   Q.     I'm not allowed to call her.

          24   A.     I got a total of three injections and

                                                           37



           1   I asked for the four but she said no.  I only

           2   got three.  That's the limit.

           3   Q.     Were all of those injections to the

           4   same part of your body?

           5   A.     I don't remember, but I remember both

           6   sides.

           7   Q.     But it was only up in your neck and

           8   upper back, right?

           9   A.     I don't know.  It's next to my neck

          10   right here.

          11   Q.     None to your lower back, though?

          12   A.     No, because I complain about the pain

          13   on my shoulder.

          14   Q.     Before this accident, did you ever

          15   have any pain, problem, discomfort, anything

          16   in your low back?

          17   A.     No.

          18   Q.     How about any pain, problem, or

          21   A.     After the accident, at first I didn't

          22   feel any discomfort or pain, but I can't

          23   recall exactly.  One to two weeks later I

          24   stopped feeling the pain.

           2   A.     Pain on both my shoulders and the back

           3   of my neck, the lower back.  At night when I

           4   sleep, I feel discomfort.

           5   Q.     All I'm asking you, sir, is that are

           6   you telling me you didn't feel any pain in

           7   your lower back until two to three weeks

           8   after the accident?

           9   A.     The low back pain, I just mean I have

          10   shoulder pain.  At night, when I lay down, I

          11   feel very discomfort.

          12   Q.     I understand you're saying that now.

          13   What I'm saying is, in the beginning of this

          14   accident, when the accident happened, when

          15   did you start feeling pain in your low back?

          16   A.     I can't recall.  I just remember that

          17   when I went to the physical therapy center I

          18   asked them for treatment and they give me

          19   massage.

          20   Q.     Did you ask them for treatment for

          21   your neck and low back the first day you went

          22   there?

          23   A.     No.

          24   Q.     Where did you tell them to treat you

                                                           39



           1   when you first went there?

           2          Where did you tell the therapist to

           3   treat you on your body when you first went to

           4   therapy?

           5   A.     No, I just asked them to treat

           6   anything.  The first day I went over there

           7   they asked me to lay down on back and they

           8   give me massage.  They let me lay on the

           9   back.

          10   Q.     Did they ask you where you were

          11   hurting when you went there the first day?

          12   A.     No, they did not ask me, and I didn't

          13   tell them either.  I just sign up for

          14   physical therapy.

          15   Q.     You just went in and circled for

          16   therapy?

          17   A.     Yes.  After that week or two later, I

          18   start feeling pain.

          19   Q.     Where?

          20   A.     The pain come mostly from my shoulder.

          21   So I told the therapist that I feel pain on

          22   my shoulder and asked him if he can give me

          23   more massage.

          24   Q.     That was two weeks after the accident,

                                                           40



           1   right?

           2   A.     Yes, that's correct.  I don't remember

           3   exactly how many weeks.  After I got the

           4   injection, I felt better and I liked it.

           5   That's why I asked for more.

           6   Q.     After you left therapy, were you

           7   feeling back to normal?

           8   A.     I felt better after I get injection,

           9   and I don't remember because it's been a long

          10   time ago.

          11               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  I don't have any

          12   more questions.

          11   surgery done, I may have got cancer.  At

          12   first, I told him I just wanted to leave.  I

          13   don't want surgery, but he didn't let me go

          14   and told me I have to have the surgery done.

          15   Q.     That was Dr. James, and we don't know

           1   A.     I start using insulin recently.

           2   Before that, I have a long time ago.

           3   Q.     Did you take insulin before the

           4   accident?

           5   A.     No.

           7   accident?

           8   A.     Yes.

           9   Q.     Who prescribed you that?

          10   A.     It's been a long time ago, so I can't

          11   recall exactly.

          12   Q.     You can't recall if you took the

          13   insulin before or after the accident, is what

          14   you're saying?

          15   A.     I don't remember.  That's correct.

          16   Q.     Do you remember who prescribed you

          17   insulin?

          18   A.     I got this from the hospital.  I don't

          19   remember.

          20   Q.     How long have you had diabetes for?

          21   A.     It's been a long time ago.  I can't

          23   Q.     Has it been more than ten years?

          24   A.     No, below ten years.  I guess it's

                                                           47



           1   between six to seven years.

           2   Q.     You had diabetes before the accident?

           3   A.     That's correct, but it's not as severe

           4   as now.  In the past, I worked and I got

           5   insurance from the company.  Every year I

           6   have to go to check up, and sometimes I

           7   didn't go.

           8   Q.     How long have you had hypertension

           9   for?

          10   A.     I don't remember.

          11   Q.     Did you have hypertension before the

          12   accident?

          13   A.     I can't remember.

          14   Q.     How long have you had high cholesterol

          15   for?

          16   A.     I can't recall how many years, but I

          17   remember after I was discharged from Enten

          18   Hospital they prescribed me the medication

          19   for high cholesterol and insulin.

          20   Q.     Did you have high cholesterol before

          21   the accident?

          22   A.     I remember before the accident because

          23   I went to Enten Hospital, and they checked me

          24   out and found out I have hypertension and

                                                           48



           1   high cholesterol.

           2   Q.     Are you still treating for your

           3   injuries that you sustained as a result of

           4   this accident?

           5   A.     I do not have any appointment or

           6   treatment with any doctor right now, but I

           7   remember a doctor -- I don't know which

           8   doctor -- told me not to lift anything that

           9   is more than 10 pounds.

          10   Q.     Do you remember the last time that you

          11   treated for your injuries as a result of this

          12   accident?

          13   A.     I don't understand what injury you're

          14   talking about.

          15   Q.     The injuries that you said earlier

          16   that you sustained to your shoulder, neck,

          17   and back.

          18   A.     I can't recall.  If you want to know,

          19   you might have to contact my doctor.

          20   Q.     Can you estimate for me if it's been

          21   more than a year since you stopped any

          22   treatment for your shoulders, neck, or back?

          23   A.     I don't understand for less or more

          24   than a year.

                                                           49



           1   Q.     Can you estimate years or months when

           2   the last time you saw any doctor for your

           3   neck, shoulder, or back?

           4   A.     I can't remember.

           5   Q.     In the past six months, have you seen

           6   any doctor for any injuries you sustained as

           7   a result of this accident?

           8   A.     No.

           9   Q.     In the past year, have you seen any

          10   doctor for any injuries that you sustained as

          11   a result of this accident?

          12   A.     I can't remember.  I didn't pay

          13   attention.

          14   Q.     Did you pay any co-pays as a result of

          15   any treatment you completed as a result of

          16   this accident?

          17   A.     No, because my insurance cover.

          18   Q.     As you sit here today, how is the pain

          19   in your neck?

          20   A.     If I sit straight, it's okay.  But if

          21   I have to turn a lot, then I feel pain.

          22   Q.     When do you have to turn a lot?

          23   A.     Like right now I have to turn to look

          24   at the interpreter and then look at you, but

                                                           50



           1   if I just look straight, it doesn't matter.

           2   Q.     As you sit here today, if you can rate

           3   for me 1 to 10, 10 being the most pain you've

           4   ever felt in your life, how would you rate

           5   your neck pain?

           6   A.     Around 5 to 6.  If I stay still, I

           7   feel okay.

           8   Q.     As you sit here today, if you can rate

           9   for me between 1 and 10, 10 being the worst

          10   pain you've ever felt, what is the pain in

          11   your shoulders?

          12   A.     I didn't feel pain in my shoulder.  I

          13   just feel pain in my vein.

          14   Q.     As you sit here today, you don't feel

          15   any pain in your shoulders?

          16   A.     No, I just feel tiring.

          17   Q.     You said you feel pain in your vein.

          18          What do you mean by that?

          19   A.     I just feel it.  I feel like not sort

          20   of pain, but it's my vein.

          21   Q.     But no shoulder pain as you sit here

          22   today?

          23   A.     I feel tiring, so I don't know if the

          24   shoulder is together.

           1   Q.     Can you point to the vein you say is

           2   feeling tired?

           3   A.     (Witness complies with request.)

           4               MS. KATHOPOULIS:  For the record,

           7   the back.

           8   BY MS. KATHOPOULIS:

           9   Q.     Mr. Vu, as you sit here today, 1 to

          10   10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt,

          11   how is the pain in your back?

          12   A.     No back pain.

          13   Q.     No back pain?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     Is there anything that you absolutely

          16   cannot do now that you could do before the

          17   accident?

          18   A.     I can't lift anything that is more

          19   than 10 pounds.  I cannot do sweeping, even

          20   though sometimes I can do it, but cannot do

          21   it as quick as I did before.  It look like I

          22   feel like I'm lazy.

          23   Q.     How often do you sweep now?

          24   A.     I can't tell you how many time I sweep

                                                           52



           1   because any time when the floor has needed

           2   sweeping than I do it.

           3   Q.     Is it more than one time a week?

           4   A.     Yes, more than once a week.

           5   Q.     Is it more than five times a week?

           6   A.     I can't recall.  I didn't pay

           7   attention.  One time I may remember.

           8   Q.     Besides lifting anything more than 10

           9   pounds and sweeping, can you not do anything

          10   right now that you could do before the

          11   accident?

          12   A.     What else?  Let me think about it.  I

          13   don't remember because I didn't pay

          14   attention.

          15   Q.     Have you ever applied for Medicare?

          16   A.     Yes, I did.

          17   Q.     When?

          18   A.     I do not need to apply.  I just get

          19   it.  They just give me.

          20   Q.     Can you show your attorney before you

          21   show me.

          21   Q.     If you saw the car immediately before

          22   the impact.

          23          Did you see the vehicle that hit you?

          13   indicate that you have severe right carpal

          14   tunnel syndrome and moderate left carpal

          15   tunnel syndrome, do you have any reason to

          16   dispute those records?

          17   A.     I don't understand, because I don't

          18   have no pain.

       15    Q.          Good morning.

       16    A.          Hello.

       17    Q.          My name is Anthony Trozzolillo and I

       18    represent Horace Mann in the lawsuit that your

       19    daughter's brought.  Could you state your full name,

       20    please?

        1    client I represent is Horace Mann.  Just a few

        2    guidelines before we start.  It's important that you

        3    give verbal answers to my questions.  So if you just say

        4    uh-huh or huh-uh, I'm going to follow up with, is that a

        5    yes or is that a no because the court reporter's taking

        6    everything down so that we can read it later on, okay?

        7    A.          Okay.

        8    Q.          And you and I can't speak at the same time.

        9    So you might anticipate what my question's going to be

       10    before I finish it.  Let me finish it.  And by the same

       11    token, if you haven't finished your answer, let me know

       12    so I don't cut in and cut you off before you're done,

       13    okay?

       14    A.          Okay.

       15    Q.          If you don't hear a question, I can repeat

       16    it.  If you don't understand a question, I can rephrase

       17    it.  And if you answer a question, I'm going to assume

       18    that you heard it, you understood it and you're giving

       19    me your best answer, all right?

       20    A.          Okay.

       21    Q.          And finally, if you need a break to confer

       22    with your attorney, let me know and we can accommodate

       23    that, okay?

       24    A.          Okay.

       25    Q.          What is your current address?

        1    Q.          And can you give me an estimate when you

        2    think you had Horace Mann?

       10    would that comport to when you came back to Horace Mann?

       11    A.          It may.

       12    Q.          Back in 2004, do you remember who the agent

       13    was?

       14    A.          I can't recall.

       15    Q.          From 2004 and 2010, do you remember if you

       16    had full tort or limited tort?

       17    A.          I can't recall.

       18    Q.          Why did you come back to Horace Mann in 2012?

       19    A.          The insurance that I had no longer offered it

       20    at a Pennsylvania residence.

       21    Q.          Who was that?

       22    A.          Liberty Mutual.

       23    Q.          So from 2010 to 2012, you had Liberty Mutual?

       24    A.          Estimate, yes.

       25    Q.          Estimate.

                                                                    11





        1    A.          Uh-huh.

        2    Q.          And do you remember if you had full tort or

        3    limited tort over that period?

        4    A.          I can't recall.

        5    Q.          When you came back in 2012 to Horace Mann, do

        6    you recall who your agent was there?

        7    A.          Al Papada.

        8    Q.          Going back to when you first selected Horace

        9    Mann as your insurance company, why did you select

       10    Horace Mann?

       11    A.          It was who my husband had.

       12    Q.          So you were familiar with Horace Mann, that's

       13    why you would have come back to it in 2012?

       14    A.          Yes.

       15    Q.          Do you remember what type of vehicle you were

       16    driving back in 2012?

       17    A.          I had two vehicles back then.

       18    Q.          Do you remember what they were?

       19    A.          One was a 2004 Mazda 3 and the other one was

       20    a Nissan Rogue -- but I can't remember the actual year

       21    of it -- were the two I had insured through Horace Mann.

       22    Q.          I forgot to ask you.  Between 2004 and

       23    2012 -- or 2010, excuse me, did you make any claims on

       24    the Horace Mann policy?  Any accidents where you made a

       25    claim?

                                                                    12





        1    A.          Not that I can recall.

        2    Q.          I may have asked you this and I apologize if

        3    I repeat myself.  But do you remember if you had limited

        4    tort or full tort with Liberty Mutual?

        5    A.          I don't remember.

        6    Q.          When you came back to Horace Mann, was

        7    Destiny of driving age at that time?

        8    A.          In 2012?

        9    Q.          Yeah.  Well, do you remember when she turned

       10    16?

       11    A.          Well, she was born in 1996.

       12                    MR. PISANCHYN:  If you know, answer; if

       13    you don't, just tell him you don't know.

       14                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't know.

       15    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       16    Q.          She was born what year?

       17    A.          1996.

       18    Q.          So that would have been around 2012 if we add

       19    16 onto 1996?

       20    A.          Okay.

       21    Q.          Any reason to disagree with that?

       22    A.          No.

       23    Q.          Did she drive as soon as she became 16?

       24    A.          No.

       25    Q.          At what age did she start driving?

                                                                    13





        1    A.          She got her license January of 2017 -- not

        2    2017.  I'm sorry.

        3    Q.          I was going to say, her accident was 2014.

        4    A.          Yeah, I'm sorry.  It would have been 2013.

        5    Because it was six months after she turned 16.

        6    Q.          When you came back to Horace Mann in 2012,

        7    did you go to Mr. Papada's office or did you do

        8    everything over the phone?

        9    A.          Everything over the phone.

       10    Q.          Had you ever met him in person?

       11    A.          No.

       12                    MR. PISANCHYN:  By "him," you mean

       13    Papada?

       14                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Mr. Papada.

       15    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       16    Q.          Can you tell me everything you can remember

       17    when you called Mr. Papada and -- well, how did you get

       18    Mr. Papada's name?  Let me ask that first.

       19    A.          I called Horace Mann to inquire about

       20    insurance and they gave me Al Papada's number.

       21    Q.          Okay.  And tell me everything you could

       22    remember about how -- what was said back and forth

       23    between you and him when you signed back up with Horace

       24    Mann.

       25    A.          Could you be more specific about which car

                                                                    14





        1    or --

        2    Q.          Did you have both cars at the time?

        3    A.          No.

        4    Q.          You just had the one car?  Do you remember

        5    which one of the two you had?

        6    A.          Well, I can't remember the exact date I went

        7    back to Horace Mann or which vehicle I had before I went

        8    back to Horace Mann.

        9    Q.          Regardless of what vehicle you had, can you

       10    tell me what was explained to you when you spoke to Mr.

       11    Papada?

       12                    MR. PISANCHYN:  And just so we're clear,

       13    you were talking about the first time that they would

       14    have spoke?

       15                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Yes.

       16                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Okay.

       17    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       18    Q.          When you signed back up with Horace Mann.

       19    A.          I just called Al inquiring about car

       20    insurance.

       21    Q.          What did he say?

       22    A.          He just explained what car insurance they

       23    offered and gave me prices on car insurance.

       24    Q.          What did he explain?

       25    A.          I can't remember specifics.

                                                                    15





        1    Q.          Do you remember if he explained to you the

        2    difference between full tort and limited tort?

        3    A.          That I can't remember.

        4    Q.          How was it that you selected the coverage

        5    that you selected?  Did you go with the lowest price?

        6    Like what was your thought process when you picked a

        7    policy that he had told you they offered?

        8    A.          I selected the best coverage that he told me

        9    would best benefit me and my family.

       10    Q.          Do you remember what he said?

       11    A.          Not specifically.

       12    Q.          Do you remember if full tort or limited tort

       13    was discussed at all during that conversation?

       14    A.          Not that I remember.

       15                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Why don't we mark

       16    this?

       17      (Exhibit Minalda-1 was marked for identification.)

       18    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       19    Q.          This at the top says The Horace Mann

       20    Company's Pennsylvania Auto Insurance Application.  And

       21    in the middle of the page it has the Mazda 3 and it's

       22    dated effective -- it says effective date 9-14-12.  Do

       23    you remember if on 9-14-12, you only had the Mazda 3 or

       24    if you still had the Nissan Rogue?

       25    A.          No, I still had the Nissan Rogue also.

                                                                    16





        1    Q.          You still did.  Okay.

        2    A.          No, actually, I didn't.  I had another

        3    Nissan.  It wasn't a Rogue.  I stand incorrect.

        4    Q.          Do you remember what kind of Nissan it was?

        5    A.          Because I traded the Nissan Rogue in

        6    September.

        7                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Do you know if you had

        8    any other cars?

        9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I had two; I had two

       10    cars.

       11    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       12    Q.          In the middle of the page here it says, tort

       13    option, limited tort.  Do you remember back in 2012

       14    telling Mr. Papada you would go along with the limited

       15    tort selection?

       16    A.          No.

       17    Q.          Do you remember if he explained the

       18    difference between full tort and limited tort to you

       19    back in 2012?

       20    A.          Not that I can recall.

       21    Q.          Did he send you any forms to sign back in

       22    2012?

       23                    MR. PISANCHYN:  At any time in 2012?

       24                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Yeah.

       25                    THE WITNESS:  He may have.

                                                                    17





        1    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

        2    Q.          You don't recall, though?

        3    A.          No.

        4    Q.          I take it if he sent you any forms to sign,

        5    you didn't save any copies?

        6    A.          Not that I could recall.

        7    Q.          Well, do you have any copies at home of any

        8    forms you signed in 2012?

        9    A.          I'm not sure.

       10    Q.          Do you remember if in 2012 Mr. Papada

       11    explained to you underinsured and uninsured motorist

       12    coverage?

       13    A.          Not that I can recall him explaining that.

       14    Q.          Do you remember in September of 2012 whether

       15    it was your intention to have limited tort or full tort?

       16    A.          If I would know the difference now, it would

       17    be full tort.

       18    Q.          Well, I understand now.  But back in 2012 --

       19    September 2012, do you recall if it was your intention

       20    to have full tort or limited --

       21    A.          Full tort.

       22    Q.          It was your intention in 2012 for full tort?

       23    A.          Yes.

       24    Q.          Between September of 2012 and August of 2014,

       25    were any of your vehicles involved in any motor vehicle

                                                                    18





        1    accidents?

        2    A.          Not that I can recall.  Oh, yes, from August

        3    of --

        4                    MR. PISANCHYN:  You mean in this case?

        5                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Yes.

        6    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

        7    Q.          Yeah.  Not the one with Destiny.

        8    A.          Oh, wait.  Not in this case.

        9    Q.          And did you have -- let me rephrase the

       10    question.  Between September 12th, 2012 when you

       11    re-signed up with Horace Mann and -- Destiny's accident

       12    was August 24, 2014 -- any time before her accident,

       13    were there any accidents that any of your vehicles were

       14    involved in?

       15    A.          No, not that I could recall.

       16    Q.          Do you remember, if prior to Destiny's

       17    automobile accident, whether you made any claims with

       18    Horace Mann?

       19    A.          Not that I could recall.

       20    Q.          If you could just look through Exhibit 1.

       21                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Just for clarification,

       22    I'm just going to do 1A, B, C, D, E, F and G. So it will

       23    be just one and then the pages, if that's okay.

       24                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Sure.

       25                    MR. PISANCHYN:  So what we were talking

                                                                    19





        1    about before for the clarification when you were going

        2    over would have been 1A.  So then he wants you to look

        3    through the rest of the documents, A through G.

        4    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

        5    Q.          Have you ever seen that packet of documents

        6    before?

        7    A.          Not the first page.  But I did see -- I

        8    remember seeing the last couple of pages.

        9    Q.          From, I guess, C to the end?

       10    A.          Yes, C to G.

       11    Q.          C to G?  The Mazda 3 that's listed on the

       12    front page, did you own that?  Was that registered in

       13    your name?

       14    A.          Yes.

       15    Q.          Was there a time that you added Destiny to

       16    the Horace Mann policy?

       17    A.          Yes.

       18    Q.          Do you remember when?

       19    A.          I don't know the specific date, no.

       20    Q.          Can you give me an estimate?

       21    A.          I'm unsure.

       22    Q.          If she started driving in January of 2013,

       23    would it have been around that time?

       24    A.          I'm not sure.

       25    Q.          Do you know how you added Destiny to the

                                                                    20





        1    policy?

        2    A.          I remember speaking to Al about adding her to

        3    it.

        4    Q.          Do you remember what you spoke about?

        5    A.          Not specifics, no.

        6    Q.          Do you remember if you spoke to Al about

        7    adding Destiny before or after her accident?

        8    A.          I'm not sure.

        9    Q.          So you could have spoken to him after the

       10    accident about adding her on the policy?

       11    A.          I'm not sure.

       12    Q.          Do you remember what, if anything, Al

       13    explained to you when you called about adding Destiny?

       14    A.          The only thing I can remember Al explaining

       15    was where her license address was at as to who she

       16    needed to be insured by, whether it was me or her

       17    father.

       18    Q.          In other words, he asked you what house -- or

       19    who she was living with, whether she was living with you

       20    or her father?

       21    A.          Correct.

       22    Q.          And how did you respond to that?

       23    A.          She lives with me, so I had to insure her.

       24    Q.          When she had the accident on August the 24th

       25    of 2014, do you remember how you went about reporting

        1    the accident to Horace Mann?

        2    A.          I believe I spoke with Al.

        3    Q.          You put the claim in through Al?

        4    A.          I think I -- I'm not really sure, but I did

        5    speak with Al about the claim.

        6    Q.          Well, do you remember if Al gave you a number

        7    to call or if Al said, I'll put it in for you?

        8    A.          I'm not sure.

        9    Q.          To your knowledge, do you know how Destiny's

       10    accident occurred?

       11    A.          I know that she was hit head-on by another

       12    driver.  But as specifics, no, other than that.

       13    Q.          When you called Al, do you remember what you

       14    told Al?

       15    A.          That my daughter was in an accident and that

       16    I needed to file a claim.

       17    Q.          Do you remember what his response was?

       18    A.          Not specifics, no.

       19    Q.          Do you remember generally?

       20    A.          No.  Probably -- not specifics, no.

       21    Q.          Do you recall if Horace Mann opened a medical

       22    payment file to pay Destiny's medical bills out of the

       23    policy?

       24    A.          Could you be more specific?

       25    Q.          Sure.  Did you or Destiny submit your medical

                                                                    22





        1    bills to Horace Mann -- her medical bills to Horace Mann

        2    to be paid?

        3    A.          We didn't directly.  I'm not sure if the

        4    hospitals did.  But we didn't directly, no.

        5    Q.          So you think the hospital gave -- see if I

        6    could rephrase this.  That the hospital sent their bills

        7    directly to Horace Mann?

        8    A.          We provided everybody with our Horace Mann

        9    claim number.

       10    Q.          Explain to me how we get from Destiny goes to

       11    the hospital and how you get a Horace Mann claim number.

       12    A.          I'm not sure what you're asking me.

       13    Q.          Well, do you have a Horace Mann claim number

       14    that you submitted the medical bills under?

       15    A.          I was provided the claim number by Horace

       16    Mann.  So then whenever I would take her for

       17    appointments or if I got a hospital bill, I would call

       18    them and give them this Horace Mann claim number.

       19    Q.          And how did you get the Horace Mann claim

       20    number?

       21    A.          From my adjuster.

       22    Q.          And how did you get an adjuster?

       23    A.          From -- I guess Al Papada provided me with

       24    someone to call -- or Horace Mann provided me with

       25    someone to call.

        1    Q.          You said when you got those, you would call

        2    the medical care provider and say, submit it under this

        3    claim number?

        4    A.          Correct.

        5    Q.          Do you remember if you ever spoke to a Horace

        6    Mann adjuster yourself?

        7    A.          Yes, I have.

        8    Q.          Do you remember who it was?

       10    Q.          Do you remember how many times you did?

       14    Q.          More than five?

       15    A.          I'm unsure.

       16    Q.          Did you ever have any issues with Horace

       17    Mann's payment of Destiny's medical bills?

       18    A.          Not that I'm aware of.

       19    Q.          To your knowledge, they paid all of her bills

       20    that were submitted to them?

       21    A.          Yes.

       22    Q.          Did you ever have to call Horace Mann and

       23    say, hey, you haven't paid this bill or this bill's

       24    getting turned over to collection, why haven't you paid

       25    it, anything like that?

        6    Q.          Did you deal with a separate adjuster on the

        7    damage done to the vehicle?

        8    A.          You mean the other driver?

        9    Q.          Is that who paid for your car?

       10    A.          No.

       11    Q.          Who --

       12    A.          Horace Mann paid for the car to be -- or the

       13    car.

       14    Q.          They totaled the car out?

       15    A.          Yes.

       16    Q.          Did you deal with an adjuster personally on

       17    the car issue -- the property damage issue?

       18    A.          Other than Horace Mann?

       19    Q.          With Horace Mann.

       20    A.          Horace Mann is the only one I dealt with.

       21    Q.          I'll represent to you that there was a woman

       22    at Horace Mann that dealt with paying your daughter's

       23    medical bills and there was a man at Horace Mann that

       24    dealt with the property damage to the car.  Do you

        1    adjuster about the property damage to the car?

        2    A.          I spoke with a male.

        6    A.          Yes.

        7    Q.          And was the property damage issue resolved to

       22    A.          Yes.  Yes.

       10    A.          Other than Al?

       11    Q.          I'm talking about the male adjuster that

       12    dealt with paying you for the car.

       13    A.          No.

       14    Q.          Do you believe he ever dealt with you

       15    unfairly?

       16    A.          No.

       17    Q.          And the woman that was handling paying

        8                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Okay.

        9    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       10    Q.          And how do you know that date?

       11    A.          Because I was going in for surgery.

       12    Q.          And did you speak to him personally?

       13    A.          Yes.

       17    Q.          Cellphone or home phone?

       18    A.          Cellphone.  He left a voicemail for me.

       19    Q.          Yeah, we'll talk about the voicemail in a

       21    him?

       22    A.          Yes.

       23    Q.          And what did he say?

       24    A.          That somebody was requesting my file, that he

       25    needed to send me paperwork that I needed to sign and

                                                                    28





        1    send back to him ASAP.

        2    Q.          So he called your cellphone numerous times.

        3    Did he leave a message each time or were they missed

        4    calls?

        5    A.          They were missed calls.

        6    Q.          And we have the one message that he did leave

        7    that you've provided your attorney, correct?

        8    A.          Correct.

        9    Q.          And at some point during the several calls he

       10    made, you and he actually connected, correct?

       11    A.          I called him back.

       12    Q.          You called him back?

       13    A.          Yes.

       14    Q.          After you got the voicemail?

       15    A.          Correct.

       16    Q.          And he told you somebody was requesting your

       18    A.          Yes.

       19    Q.          And he said he was going to send you some

       20    paperwork, you needed to sign and return it ASAP?

       21    A.          Yes.

       22    Q.          Did he say anything about dating the

       23    paperwork?

       24    A.          He said that I needed to date them from the

       25    day that I got the policy -- that he would place an X on

                                                                    29





        1    the spots that I needed to sign, that I needed to date

        2    them from the day I got the policy because if I didn't,

        3    it would look like I didn't have any car insurance and

        4    my claim would not be paid.  And provided me with the

        5    date that needed to be put on the forms.

        6    Q.          And he provided you the date to put on the

        7    forms?

        8    A.          Yes.

        9    Q.          Did you write that date down?

       10    A.          Yes.

       11    Q.          Do you still have that piece of paper?

       12    A.          Yes.

       13                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Michael, do you have

       14    it?

       15                    MR. PISANCHYN:  I don't believe so.

       16    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       17    Q.          Could you turn that --

       18    A.          What do you mean, these papers?

       19    Q.          Oh, no.  I'm talking about when Al -- when

       20    you and Al speak on the phone, he told you the date to

       21    put on the forms when you got the forms, correct?

       22    A.          Yes.

       23    Q.          Did you write -- when you were on the phone

       24    with him, did you write that date down?

       25    A.          No.

        1    Q.          Okay.

        2                    MR. PISANCHYN:  And just for the record,

        3    when she was referencing your question, she put her hand

        4    out on the forms meaning the forms C through G and then

        5    that's what led you to ask the follow-up questions.

        6    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

        7    Q.          And then you've looked through -- what is it,

        8    C through G?  Are those the forms that you subsequently

        9    got from Al?

       10                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Just with the

       11    clarification, of course, these ones are already signed.

       12    So she would have gotten the blank forms.  I just want

       13    to make sure.

       14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

       16    Q.          Okay.  So the C through G, you would have

       17    gotten them from Al and they were blank?

       18    A.          Correct.  The forms I received from Al Papada

       19    via e-mail were blank.

       20    Q.          They came via e-mail?

       21    A.          Yes.

       22    Q.          Do you still have the e-mail?

       23    A.          Yes.

       24    Q.          Did the e-mail say anything other than sign

       25    the forms?

                                                                    31





        1    A.          It said he placed an X where I needed to sign

        2    and to get them back to him.

        3    Q.          Does the e-mail say, date them back to 2012?

        4    A.          I'm not sure if it says that.  I would have

        5    to re-read it.

        6                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Michael, do you

        7    have --

        8                    MR. PISANCHYN:  I do not.  But I'd ask

        9    that you send me the e-mail and I'll send it to them,

       10    okay?

       11    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       12    Q.          Yeah, if you could send the e-mail that Al

       13    sent you to Attorney Pisanchyn.

       14                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Do so today if you can.

       15    And once I get it, I will e-mail it to them, okay.

       16                    THE WITNESS:  Sure.

       17    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       18    Q.          And if we look at the forms, you dated them

       19    September 14th, 2012?

       20    A.          Correct.

       21    Q.          And if we look at Letter A -- Page Letter A,

       22    I know you hadn't seen this before, but that has an

       23    effective of 9-14-12 on it?

       24    A.          Correct.

       25    Q.          So this date of September 14, '12 is the date

                                                                    32





        1    that Al gave you over the phone?

        2    A.          Correct.

        3    Q.          And I know you haven't given the e-mail yet

        4    to your attorney, but do you remember if the e-mail says

        5    date the forms 9-14-12 or words to that effect?

        6    A.          I'm not sure.  He had just threatened on the

        7    phone that I needed to get the forms back ASAP.

        8    Q.          And you needed to date it 2012 -- 9-14-12 or

        9    it would look like you didn't have coverage?

       10    A.          Correct.  Is it okay if I take a break?

       11                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Oh, sure.

       12     (A recess was taken from 10:52 a.m. until 11:01 a.m.)

       13    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       14    Q.          And then Exhibit 1C through G is what he sent

       15    you in the e-mail?

       16                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Just look at each page

       17    and see if that's what he had sent you.

       18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it looks familiar.

       19    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       20    Q.          Okay.  Did you ever have any conversations

       21    with Mr. Papada again after this conversation on

       22    September the 25th?

       23    A.          Not that I can remember.

       24    Q.          And looking at the forms on Page C, you dated

       25    it -- well, is that your signature?

                                                                    33





        1    A.          Yes.

        2    Q.          And you dated it 9-14-12 as you indicated

        3    Mr. Papada told you to sign it, correct?

        4    A.          Yes.

        5    Q.          And he signed it 9-25-14.  Do you know why he

        6    signed it as of 9-25-14 instead of 9-14-12?

        7    A.          I'm not sure why he signed that date.

        8                    MR. PISANCHYN:  And just so we know, I

        9    don't know if I'm agreeing that that's the date he

       10    signed initially.  It may be something he put after he

       11    got caught doing what he did.  But again, that's our

       12    position.

       13                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Yeah.  I'm going by

       14    what's on the document.

       15                    MR. PISANCHYN:  That's why I let her

       16    answer the question before I put that there.  But of

       17    course, I don't want me to not object, meaning that I

       18    agree.  But I let her answer first to be fair to you

       19    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       20    Q.          Earlier in the deposition, I asked you about

       21    what it was -- your intent back in 2012, what kind of

       22    tort option to select in 2012.  And you said your intent

       23    in 2012 was for full tort.  Do you recall that?

       24    A.          Yes.

       25    Q.          If you'd look at Page G, you signed under

                                                                    34





        1    limited tort.  If it was your intention in 2012 to

        2    obtain full tort coverage, can you tell me why in 2014

        3    when you signed this form you signed it for limited

        4    tort?

        5    A.          Because I trusted Al to send me the correct

        6    documents that I was supposed to sign.

        7    Q.          Well, this is not the correct document?

        8    A.          Not that I should have had, no.

        9    Q.          Did you call Al and say you sent me the

       10    limited tort form, I told you two years ago I wanted

       11    full tort?

       12    A.          It was kind of like a threatening situation

       13    where I, kind of, had to sign the forms and get them

       14    back ASAP.

       15    Q.          I understand you had to get them back ASAP.

       16    But if it was your intention for full tort, why did you

       17    sign a limited tort form when he sent it to you?

       18    A.          I'm not sure.

       19                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Other than what she

       20    said, she trusted him and she felt threatened.

       21    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       22    Q.          When you felt threatened by Al, did you

       23    immediately retain counsel?

       24                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Don't answer that

       25    question.  It's attorney-client privilege when she

                                                                    35





        1    obtained counsel and the reasoning behind why she did.

        2    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

        3    Q.          Well, when you felt threatened by Al, what

        4    did you do?

        5                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Other than getting a

        6    lawyer, you can say if you did anything else.

        7                    THE WITNESS:  Just retained a lawyer,

        8    asked questions.

        9    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       10    Q.          Did you report being threatened by Al to

       11    Horace Mann?

       12    A.          No, because at that point, I really didn't

       13    think I could trust Horace Mann Insurance Companies.

       14    Q.          Well, what did Horace Mann do that made you

       15    believe you couldn't trust them to report Al to?

       16    A.          They provided me with an agent that I

       17    couldn't trust and he was employed by Horace Mann.

       18    Q.          Why didn't you go over his head and report

       19    him, that he threatened you?

       20    A.          Because at that point, I didn't know if I

       21    could trust anybody in the Horace Mann Company.

       22    Q.          Well, up until the point that Al threatened

       23    you, you believed you were treated fairly with the

       24    medical bill payments and with the property damage

       25    payments, correct?

                                                                    36





        1    A.          At that point.

        2    Q.          And Al told you -- if I'm restating your

        3    testimony, Al told you if you didn't sign the forms

        4    dated 2012 -- September 14, 2012, it would look like you

        5    didn't have insurance, correct?

        6    A.          Correct.

        7    Q.          But up until that point, Horace Mann was

        8    paying the medical bills, gave you a claim number and

        9    paid for the property damage, correct?

       10    A.          As for specific dates when all of it was

       11    paid, I'm unsure of the claim date and when bills were

       12    paid and who I spoke to.

       13    Q.          Horace Mann, the records show, opened a claim

       14    for you on September -- I'm sorry, August 29th, 2014,

       15    which is about a month before you spoke to Al where he

       16    threatened you.  Does that sound right to you?  Any

       17    reason to disagree with that date, that they opened a

       18    claim for you early -- or the end of August?

       19    A.          No.

       20    Q.          If you go to Page F.  And is that your

       21    signature on Page F?

       22    A.          Yes.

       23    Q.          And it looks like it's written 9-12-12 and

       24    then over the first 12 is a 14 and written over the

       25    second 12 is another 14.  Does that look right to you,

                                                                    37





        1    what I just said?

        2                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Meaning -- I don't want

        3    her to characterize what it says.  I mean, we're looking

        4    at the same thing you're looking at and it speaks for

        5    itself.  So, I mean, if you can rephrase the question

        6    just about what exactly --

        7    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

        8    Q.          Sure.  Does it look like under the first 14,

        9    that there's a 12?

       10                    MR. PISANCHYN:  If you --

       11                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

       12    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       13    Q.          And under the second -- under the last --

       14                    MR. PISANCHYN:  4.

       15    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       16    Q.          Does it look like someone wrote 14 over the

       17    number 12?

       18    A.          Yes.

       19    Q.          Did you do that?

       20                    MR. TROZZOLILLO:  Don't tell her what to

       21    say, Michael.  You're shaking your head no.

       22                    THE WITNESS:  I can't say for sure.

       23    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       24    Q.          And you had no other telephone conversations

       25    with Al Papada except for that one?  And the voicemail

                                                                    38





        1    he left you, those are the only -- I'm going to

        2    rephrase.  You had no other phone conversations with Al

        3    Papada after the 25th -- September the 25th?

        4    A.          Not that I can recall.  Looks like my

        5    handwriting underneath, then somebody's handwriting over

        6    it.

        7    Q.          Do you know if your daughter ever spoke to Al

        8    Papada?

        9    A.          Not that I'm aware of.

       10    Q.          Are you aware if your daughter spoke to

       11    anyone at Horace Mann?

       12    A.          Not that I'm aware of.

       13    Q.          Did you tell your daughter about the

       14    conversation you had with Papada?

       15    A.          No, that I'm aware of.

       16    Q.          You said you felt threatened by Papada?

       17    A.          Yes.

       18    Q.          Did you ever feel threatened by anyone from

       19    Horace Mann who was handling your daughter's claim?

       20                    MR. PISANCHYN:  Other than Papada.

       21    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       22    Q.          Yeah.

       23    A.          No.

       24    Q.          And other than reporting the accident to

       25    Papada and having to -- dealing with Papada over these

                                                                    39





        1    signatures, you had no other dealings with him after

        2    your daughter's accident, correct?

        3    A.          What do you mean?  Like, can you rephrase

        4    that?

        5    Q.          Sure.  You reported the accident to Papada,

        6    correct?

        7    A.          Uh-huh.

        8    Q.          Yes?  You have to say yes.

        9    A.          Yes.

       10    Q.          And you talked to Papada over the signing of

       11    the forms, correct?

       12    A.          I don't recall.

       13    Q.          Well, you just said he threatened you.

       14    A.          Oh, yes.

       15    Q.          And you don't recall ever speaking to him

       16    again after that?

       17    A.          Not about the car accident.

       18    Q.          Did you speak to him about other things?

       19    A.          Yes, I did speak to him about other things

       20    when I needed insurance on other vehicles.

       21    Q.          And when was that?

       22    A.          I can't remember.

       23    Q.          Well, let me ask you this.  When did you --

       24    I'm assuming you left Horace Mann.  I'm assuming they

       25    don't insure you anymore.

                                                                    40





        1    A.          No.

        2    Q.          When did you leave Horace Mann?

        3    A.          In 2017.

        4    Q.          Why did you leave Horace Mann?

        5    A.          Because of Al Papada.

        6    Q.          Why didn't you leave Horace Mann in 2014 when

        7    Al threatened you?

        8                    MR. PISANCHYN:  I don't want her to say

        9    anything in regard to attorney-client privilege.  So

       10    anything other than what your lawyer would tell you.

       11    BY MR. TROZZOLILLO:

       12    Q.          Anything that -- any conversations you had

        2    A.          MR. PISANCHYN:  Well, I'd object.  Maybe she

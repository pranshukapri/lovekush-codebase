           2           JASMIN CHOUR, after having been duly

           3   sworn, was examined and testified as

           4   follows...

           5                       - - -

           6               MR. LOMBARDO:  Let's put on the

           7   record that defendant Andrea Baxter was

           8   noticed for the deposition today, and

           9   Ms. Andrea Baxter is not available.  She's

          10   not present.

          11               The reason for that is what?

          12               MR. MANARA:  I would actually ask

          13   if I can see the notice because I never got

          14   one.

          15               MR. LOMBARDO: Yes, you did.  The

          16   notice was sent.  Just place on record that

          17   Ms. Baxter was noticed for the deposition

          18   today, and she's unavailable.

          19               MR. MANARA:  Note my objection

          20   because counsel never received a notice, and

          21   I would ask counsel provide a notice of

          22   today's deposition for my client.  I never

          23   received it.

          24               MR. LOMBARDO:  If this goes to a

           1   motion before the Court, I will provide that

           2   notice of the deposition to counsel for his

           3   client.

           4               MR. MANARA:  Could I just ask

           5   where did you send it, and who did you sent

           6   it to?

           7               MR. LOMBARDO:  I sent it to

           8   e-mail, fax, regular address.  I think I'm

           9   running out of options.  I could send it

          10   certified, but definitely e-mail, electronic

          11   e-mail, fax and regular mail.

          12               But if this goes to a motion,

          13   we'll address it then.  Let's continue.

          14               MR. MANARA:  I don't recall ever

          15   seeing it.  My client wouldn't be notified if

          16   I never saw a notice of deposition.

          20   BY MR. MANARA:

          21   Q.     Good morning, Ms. Chour.

          22   A.     Chour.

          23   Q.     Good morning, Ms. Chour.  My name is

          24   Michael Manara.  I represent Andrea Baxter

           1   for a car accident that occurred February 6th

           2   of 2017.

           3          We are here today to take your

           4   deposition.

           5   A.     Okay.

           6   Q.     Have you ever been deposed before?

           7   A.     Never.

           8   Q.     A couple ground rules before we begin.

           9   A deposition is a question-and-answer

          10   session.  It's not designed to trick or

          11   confuse you.  We're just trying to find out

          12   what happened.

          13   A.     Okay.

          14   Q.     You're testifying here today through

          15   an interpreter?

          16   A.     Yes.

          17   Q.     You're being responsive to my

          18   questions?

          19   A.     Yes.

          20   Q.     Are there any issues you have

          21   understanding the interpreter?

          22   A.     No problem.

          23   Q.     It seems like you do understand some

          24   English?

                                                            8



           1   A.     Some.

           2   Q.     Answer in your native language, and

           3   allow the interpreter to interpret, okay?

           4   A.     Okay.

           5   Q.     A couple of ground rules for the

           6   deposition.  First, I need you to answer

           7   verbally.  As you can see, there is a court

           8   reporter here typing down everything we're

           9   saying, and she can't take any head nods or

          10   hand gestures.

          11   A.     Okay.

          12   Q.     Same with uh-uh and uh-huh.  I don't

          13   think it should be a problem because we have

          14   the interpreter, but they read the same way

          15   on the record.  If we ask is that a yes or is

          16   that a no, we just want to make it clear,

          17   okay?

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     If at any time I'm speaking too fast

          20   or you need me to rephrase the question or

          21   you don't understand the question, let me

          22   know, and I'll be happy to rephrase the

          23   question.

          24   A.     Yes.

                                                            9



           1   Q.     Because if you answer my question, I

           2   will assume two very important things; one,

           3   that you understood the question; two, the

           4   answer is the truth; is that fair?

           5   A.     Yes.

           6   Q.     Do you understand the oath you took

           7   today is the same oath you'd take in a

           8   courtroom?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     It's subject to the same penalties?

          11   A.     Yes.

          12   Q.     We're here to discuss essentially

          13   three things; one, the accident that

          14   occurred.

          15   A.     Yes.

          16   Q.     Two, the injuries you're claiming; and

          17   three, any effects on your life.

          18   A.     Yes.

          19   Q.     Is there any reason you can't discuss

          20   those three things with me here today?

          21   A.     I can just tell you all my injuries

          22   today?

          23   Q.     Yes.  Is there any reason why you

          24   can't discuss that with me here today?

                                                           10



           1               MR. LOMBARDO:  Just to make sure

           2   she understands your question.  Is there any

           3   reason why she can't?  There is many reasons

           4   why she can't.

           5               Why don't you ask the question

           6   first, and then she can address if she's able

           7   to answer that accurately and truthfully.

           8               On behalf of my client, yes, if

           9   she understands the question.

          10               Is that fair enough?

          11               MR. MANARA:  No.

          12               MR. LOMBARDO:  You rephrase then.

          13   BY MR. MANARA:

          14   Q.     Is there any reason why you can't

          15   discuss the accident, your injuries, and the

          16   effects on your life here today?

          17   A.     No reason.

          18   Q.     Can you state your full name for me,

          19   please.

          20   A.     Jasmine Chour.

          21   Q.     Have you ever gone by any other names?

          22   A.     No, never.

          23   Q.     Are you under the influence of any

          24   medication or substances that would affect

                                                           11



           1   your ability to understand what's going on

           2   here today?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     Prior to your deposition, did you

           5   review any documentation?

           6   A.     No, I didn't.

           7   Q.     Other than your attorney, did you

           8   discuss your deposition with anybody else?

           9   A.     No never.

          10               MR. MANARA:  Off the record.

          11                       - - -

          12               (Whereupon, a discussion was held

          13    off the record.)

          15               MR. LOMBARDO:  I'm instructing my

          16   client that she's not presenting a wage loss

          17   claim.

          18               You can ask her if she has any

          19   criminal background.

          20               MR. MANARA:  I will.  I'll do

          21   that.

          22               MR. LOMBARDO:  I feel she's not

          23   entitled to give you a Social Security number

          24   if she's not making a wage loss claim.

           1               MR. MANARA:  It's a standard

           2   question in the Philadelphia interrogatories,

           3   which cannot be objected to, and that is

           4   sanctionable per the local rules.

           5               MR. LOMBARDO:  You show that rule

           6   to me.

           7               MR. MANARA:  4005.

           8               MR. LOMBARDO:  That my client has

           9   to give you a Social Security number to run a

          10   criminal background check?

          11               MR. MANARA:  That's one of the

          12   reasons.  The issue is it's a standard rule.

          13   It's sanctionable under Rule 4005.

          14               MR. LOMBARDO:  Nevertheless,

          15   given that fact, if that is in case the fact,

          16   you have her Social Security number in the

          17   interrogatories.

          18               MR. MANARA:  Did you answer all

          19   of them?

          20               MR. LOMBARDO:  Of course.

          21               MR. MANARA:  Because most of your

          22   interrogatories were objected to.

          24   Q.     Ma'am, off the record I asked you what

           2   back to you.

           2   A.     I was just a passenger.

           3   Q.     Is that because you don't have a

           4   license?

           6   form.

           7               You can answer.

           8               THE WITNESS:  Say that again,

           9   please.

          10   BY MR. MANARA:

          11   Q.     Is that because you don't have a

          12   license?

          13   can answer one of your questions?

          14               MR. MANARA:  Are you instructing

          20   sometime in 2018.

          21               MR. LOMBARDO:  That wasn't it.

          11   Q.     Where is the store located?

          12   A.     4325 Chestnut.

          13   Q.     How long have you been there?

          14               MR. LOMBARDO:  She's not making a

          15   wage loss claim.  I'm going to instruct my

          16   client not to answer anything about her

          17   employment because she's not making a wage

          18   loss claim.

          19               MR. MANARA:  It would also go to

          20   limitations.

          21               Are you still instructing her not

          22   to answer?

          23               MR. LOMBARDO:  Repeat your last

          24   question.

           1               MR. MANARA:  I asked her how long

           2   she's been there.

           3               MR. LOMBARDO:  This goes to,

           4   quote, limitations.  Again, she's not making

           5   a wage loss claim.

           6               MR. MANARA:  You already stated

           7   for the record, Counsel, no wage loss claim

           8   and no loss of future earnings; is that

           9   accurate?

          10               MR. LOMBARDO:  No, it's not

          11   accurate.  She's not making a present wage

          12   loss claim.  There is a possibility of future

          13   wage loss, but right now we are not

          14   submitting any loss of wage claim.

          15               MR. MANARA:  When you say right

          16   now, do you intend to submit?

          17               MR. LOMBARDO:  We haven't made

          18   that determination yet.  Can we continue with

          19   the deposition, please.

          20               MR. MANARA:  If you're not --

          21               MR. LOMBARDO:  Continue to ask

          22   her.  Please follow up with your questions.

          23               MR. MANARA:  Because you don't

          24   know if you're making a wage loss claim --

           1               MR. LOMBARDO:  No.  I don't want

           2   to repeat myself, but I will.  We are not

           3   presently making a wage loss claim.  We have

           4   yet to determine whether or not a future or

           5   potential loss of earning claim will be made.

           6   We still have yet to make that determination.

           8   Q.     Working at Donuts Plus, what are your

           9   duties there?

          10   A.     I'm a seller, and I also do some

          11   cleaning around there.

          12   Q.     What type of cleaning?

          13   A.     Just cleaning the machine and cleaning

          14   in the area, and there's dust of flower and

          15   powders here and there, so I make it nice and

          16   clean.

          17   Q.     Any mopping, scrubbing?

          18   A.     I only use some broom to clean the

          19   dust but not mopping.

          20   Q.     How many hours a day do you work?

          21   A.     Four to five hours a day.

          22   Q.     How many days a week do you work?

          23   A.     It's hard to really say.  Probably

          24   mostly around 25 hours a week because I only

           1   get called when she needs my help.  So it's

           2   on a calling base.

           3   Q.     I understand you're currently working

           4   there, were you working there at the time of

           5   the accident.

           6          Were you employed at the donut shop in

           7   February of 2017?

           8               MR. LOMBARDO:  Note my objection

           9   as to form.

          10               MR. MANARA:  Are you instructing

          11   her not to answer?

          12               MR. LOMBARDO:  Michael, please

          13   don't ask me that question.  If I instruct my

          14   client not to answer, I will verbally tell

          15   you that I'm instructing my client not to

          16   answer.

          17               Please refrain from continuing to

          18   ask me whether or not I'm instructing my

          19   client not to answer.

          20               Are we clear?

          21               MR. MANARA:  Counsel --

          22               MR. LOMBARDO:  Are we clear?  Are

          23   we clear?

          24               MR. MANARA:  I'm an adult.

           1   You're an adult.  I'm trying to be civil

           2   here.

           3               MR. LOMBARDO:  So am I.  That's

           4   all I need to know.

           5               Are we clear that you will not

           6   ask me whether or not I'm instructing my

           7   client not to answer?

           8               MR. MANARA:  No, we're not.

           9   Here's why:  Earlier in the deposition I said

          10   to your client you may answer, and you told

          11   me that was a determination that I'm not

          12   allowed to make.  Based on your conversation

          13   and your questions --

          14               MR. LOMBARDO:  I'm not

          15   instructing my client not to answer, though.

          16   All I said was note my objection as to form.

          17               MR. MANARA:  Fair enough.

          19   Q.     Ma'am, at the time of the accident in

          20   February 2017, were you employed at Donuts

          23   as to form.

           1               THE WITNESS:  After the accident,

           2   I have to stop working for about two, three

           3   months because I was unable to work.

           4   BY MR. MANARA:

           5   Q.     Did any doctor put a restriction and

           6   tell you you could not work as a result of

           7   the accident?

           8   A.     No, not like that, but I know myself.

           9   I was hurt because of the injuries.  I wasn't

          10   able to perform my duty.

          11   Q.     My question was, did any doctor put a

          12   restriction on you telling you you couldn't

          13   work?

          14   A.     No.

          15   Q.     What parts of your body stopped you

          16   from working -- I'll rephrase the question.

          17          You indicated you were unable to work

          18   for about two to three months after the

          19   accident?

          20   A.     Correct.

          21   Q.     What parts of your body stopped you

          22   from working and an injury?

          23          Was there any injury that stopped you

           4               THE WITNESS:  Like half of my

           5   hand and my body up to my neck.  I wasn't

           6   able to make a good motion to do anything.  I

           7   couldn't move much.  It was painful whenever

           8   I tried to move or do anything with it.

           9   BY MR. MANARA:

          10   Q.     What side of your body?

          11   A.     On my right side.

          12   Q.     Anything to the left?

          13   A.     My left side is okay, I'm fine.

          14   Q.     After those two to three months, did

          15   you go back to work?

          16   A.     Yes, I did.

          17   Q.     Were any accommodations made for you

          18   when you got back to work?

          19   A.     Just being at the register, just

          20   selling the donuts.

          21   Q.     Is that what you did before the

          22   accident?

          23   A.     Before the accident, I was able to do

          24   more work for them, like lifting up or

                                                           28



           1   stocking sodas and drinks and picking up

           2   heavy stuff.  Now, I'm not able to do any of

           3   that.  Especially, it cause more pain at

           4   night, too.  I tried to do other heavy

           5   lifting, but I wasn't able to.

           6   Q.     At the time of the accident, how much

           7   were you making?

          11               MR. MANARA:  There is potential

          12   future wage loss claim.

          13               MR. LOMBARDO:  I'm instructing my

          14   client not to answer.  She's not making a

          15   present wage loss claim.

          16               MR. MANARA:  It would go to

          17   future wage loss.

          18               MR. LOMBARDO:  We haven't yet

          19   made the determination.  I'm instructing my

          20   client not to answer.

           9   Q.     Tell me how the accident happened in

          10   your own words.

          11   A.     At the time, I wasn't the driver, so I

          12   didn't really pay attention to anything

          13   around me.  I was just sitting there.

          14   Q.     At some point while you were sitting

          15   there, did you feel an impact?

          17   Q.     Were any cars stopped in front of you?

          20   of you was stopped?

          21   A.     I didn't really pay attention to that

          22   when the impact happened or before that.  I

           1   in front?

           2   A.     It did push the vehicle but not far

           3   enough to hit the other vehicle in front

           4   because that vehicle in front was a bit far

           5   from our car.

           6   Q.     Do you know how far you were pushed?

           7   A.     I don't know.

           8   Q.     Did the impact push your car in any

           9   other lanes, or did your car stay in the

          12   lane.

          17               THE WITNESS:  After the impact,

          18   my cousin got out of the vehicle to take a

          19   look.  I do know that that vehicle wasn't

          20   able to move or go anywhere because whatever

          21   is in front of that vehicle was smoke and

          22   stuff was coming out in the front of the hood

          23   of the vehicle.

           5   the vehicle to take a look at it, but it

           6   might be just right in the middle of the back

           7   bumper.  I'm not sure because I didn't get

           8   car?

          11               MR. MANARA:  I asked if she saw

          12   damage.  I'm asking if she ever saw the car.

          13               MR. LOMBARDO:  She already said

          14   she never saw your client's vehicle.

          15               MR. MANARA:  I understand you're

          16   saying it.  You're not testifying.

          17               MR. LOMBARDO:  Note my objection.

          20   car after the impact?

          21   A.     Never seen it.

          22   Q.     Immediately after the impact, what

          23   happened?

          24   A.     Just right after impact, suddenly I

                                                           46



           1   felt like my neck got tight.  It's like it's

           2   being held in a certain tight position unable

           3   to move, and I feel numbness on my arms and

           4   on my shoulder.

           5   Q.     Which arm?

           6   A.     The right side.

           7   Q.     Did you feel that immediately?

           8   A.     No.  Actually, right away was just to

           9   my neck, and then at nighttime is when I

          10   start to feel the numbness sensation.

          11   Q.     After the impact happened while you

          12   were sitting in the car, what happened?

          13   A.     Right at that moment I wasn't aware of

          14   anything yet, and I just know I felt the

          15   impact.  I felt a strong force.  I asked my

          16   cousin what happened, and my cousin said

          17   someone just hit us from behind.

          18   Q.     You indicated your cousin got out of

          19   the car?

          20   A.     Correct.

          21   Q.     Did you see where he went at all?

          22   A.     I believe he got out to take a look at

          23   the vehicle or probably to meet with the

          24   driver that hit his car.

           2   Q.     While you were sitting in the car on

           3   scene, did you ever speak to my client at

           4   all?

           5   A.     No, I did not.

           6   Q.     Did your cousin ask you if you were

           7   hurt at all?

          16   neck just got locked up.  My neck just locked

          17   up.  I wasn't able to move, but I don't know

          18   if my hands or shoulder were hurt or not;

          19   I'll let you know.  The next morning is when

          20   I let him know.

          21   Q.     Did anybody call an ambulance?

          22   A.     Not that I know of.

          21   Q.     Do you remember when that was?

          22   A.     Around February 14th.

          23   Q.     How did you find out about -- where

          24   was it?

          16               MR. LOMBARDO:  Objection as to

           1   started at therapy, did you seek any

           2   treatment during that time?

           3   A.     No, I did not.

           4   Q.     Is there a reason why not?

           5   A.     Because at the time I did not know

           6   where to go and where would be a good place

           7   to go.

           8   Q.     When you got to therapy at

           9   Dr. D'Angelo, what were your complaints?

          10   What did you tell him hurt?

          11   A.     I told him I felt like my neck got

          12   locked up and got so stiff, and my arms, I

          13   feel very numb from time to time.  Mostly,

          14   it's just numb.

          15   Q.     Again, when you say arm, is that just

          16   your right arm?

          17   A.     Correct.

          18   Q.     No issues with your left arm as a

          19   result of this accident; is that fair?

          13   Q.     Other than that laying down on that

          14   steam and the massage, did they do any other

          15   treatment for you at the therapist's office?

          21   A.     No, never.

          22   Q.     Did they do any diagnostic testing?

          23   A.     Well, I did get some images done to my

          24   neck and arms.

                                                           54



           1   Q.     An MRI, does that sound about right?

           2   A.     Correct.

           3   Q.     That MRI, do you remember if you were

           4   put in a tube, or were you sitting down?

           5   A.     I was just sitting.

           6   Q.     I see an MRI on April 25th of 2017 to

           7   your lower back, does that ring a bell?

           8   A.     Well, I remember getting the MRI

           9   sitting.  They just tell me to sit.  I don't

          10   know where they did the image or the

          11   pictures.  I don't know.

          12   Q.     Just to be clear, did you injure your

          13   lower back as a result of the accident in

          14   February 2017?

          15   A.     At the time, I did have feeling of

          16   pain or discomfort to my lower back.

          17   Q.     Earlier, I asked you what parts of

          18   your body you injured.  You told me your neck

          19   and right shoulder.  I'm just trying to get

          20   all of it, okay?

          21   A.     Correct.

          22   Q.     Are you saying you injured your lower

          23   back as a result of this accident?

          24   A.     Well, yes.  It's just that, if you

                                                           55



           1   compare the pain and suffering I have to my

           2   neck and my shoulder, it's less.  Because

           3   it's so less, I don't pay much attention to

           4   it because I was able to get by with it

           5   unless I lift something heavy.  Once I start

           6   to lift something heavy to trigger it, that's

           7   when the pain come up and became more

           8   discomfort.

           9   Q.     Other than your neck, right arm, and

          10   your lower back, any other parts of your body

          11   you're claiming injury to as a result of this

          12   accident?

          13   A.     That's all.

          14   Q.     Did anybody ever discuss the results

          15   of your low back MRI to you?

          21   of 2017.

          22          Does that sound about right?

          10   with at therapy?

          14   remember.  I don't think so.  Every time I go

          15   there I just have to tell them where I feel

          16   the pain or discomfort, what do I need help

          17   in, and they continue to do what they can do

          18   to help, mainly with the steams and massage

          19   most often.

           2   A.     I don't remember any.

           3   Q.     Not that they recommended, did you

           4   ever have surgery or injections as a result

          16   Q.     Other than therapy, have you treated

          17   anywhere else as a result of this accident in

          18   February of 2017?

          19   A.     No, not that I remember.

          20   Q.     Your therapy with Dr. D'Angelo, did it

          21   help?

          22   A.     Yes, it did help a little bit.

          23   Q.     Since your discharge in September of

          24   2017, have you sought any treatment at that

           2          Have you sought any treatment for this

           3   accident since September 2017?

           4   A.     No, no other treatment except when I

           5   go home or when I'm at home.  I do continue a

           6   certain exercise just to help, some

           7   stretching and some exercise here and there.

           8   Q.     Those home exercises, were they given

           9   to you by somebody at therapy?

          10   A.     It's not recommended from the therapy

          11   place.  It's just people that I know that

          12   know me recommended me to do a certain

          13   exercise at home because it helped them, so

          14   they thought it might help me, as well.

          15   Q.     Those people who recommended the home

          16   exercises, are they medical professionals?

          17               MR. LOMBARDO:  Note my objection

          18   as to form.

          21   Q.     As you sit here today, do you have any

          22   plans on seeking treatment as a result of

           5   Q.     Are you taking any medication as a

           6   result of this accident?

           7   A.     Not on a daily basis.  It's just that

           8   when I start to feel discomfort and pain I

           9   take Aleve to help me get better.

          10   Q.     Does the Aleve help?

          11   A.     Yes, it does help some.

          12   Q.     Prior to this accident, have you ever

           1   the ER as a result of this accident?

           2   A.     I thought it was just temporary pain.

           3   I didn't think it was going to be anything

           4   severe or carry on for a long time.  That's

           5   why my thinking wasn't really to go to the

           6   emergency.

           7   Q.     Have you ever been treated by a

           8   chiropractor or physical therapist before

           9   this accident?

          10   A.     No, never.

          11   Q.     Did anybody at therapy refer you to

          12   another doctor, like an orthopedist, a

          13   neurologist or a neurosurgeon?

          14   A.     I don't quite remember.  I believe

          15   there was one time they recommended me to go

          16   to some kind of bone place related to bone.

          17   I don't know exactly what it's called or what

          18   they did or what it is that they're looking

          19   to find.  I don't remember all of that.

          20   Q.     They recommended you a bone place, you

          21   think?

          22   A.     It's probably something that they want

          23   to see to look at the pictures or whatever

          24   they took, if there is anything that affects

                                                           61



           1   inside the bones or anything that would cause

           2   the pain or discomfort.

           3   Q.     Did you go to that bone place?

           4   A.     I didn't.

           5   Q.     Is there a reason why you didn't go?

           6   A.     Because I was thinking I don't think

           7   there is any broken bone or fractures in my

           8   body.  I didn't think I would need to go see

           9   any bone doctor.

          10   Q.     Ma'am, have you paid anything out of

          11   pocket as a result of this accident?

          14               THE WITNESS:  Yeah, but I didn't

          15   think it was a big deal to mention it.

          16   BY MR. MANARA:

          17   Q.     What did you pay?

          18   A.     Some medicines for pain and stuff like

          19   that that I need to take when I feel pain.

          20   Q.     Are these over the counter or

          21   prescription?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     Do you know how much?

          24   A.     A couple dollars each time.

          19   Q.     Ma'am, very briefly I would just like

          20   to do a quick pain scale with you, okay?  10

          21   would be the worst pain you've ever

          22   experienced in your entire life, and 0 would

          23   be no pain at all.

          24          Does that make sense?

                                                           63



           1   A.     Okay.

           2   Q.     You indicated to me earlier you

           3   injured your neck down your right arm and

           4   your lower back.

           5   A.     Correct.

           6   Q.     Discussing your neck, when you first

           7   started to feel pain in your neck, how would

           8   you rate that pain?

           9   A.     About 5 and 6.

          10   Q.     At the end of treatment in September

          11   of 2017, how would you rate the pain to your

          12   neck?

          13   A.     It's better, around 3 and 4.  It's

          14   still there.

          15   Q.     As you sit here today, how would you

          16   rate the pain to your neck?

          17   A.     Around 2 or 3, because as I'm sitting

          18   for a certain amount of time, I still feel

          19   some numbness sensation there.

          20   Q.     Discussing your right arm, does that

          21   right arm pain travel from your neck, or is

          22   it actually your shoulder?

          23   A.     It's separate from the neck.  No

          24   traveling from there.

                                                           64



           1   Q.     The pain in your neck stayed in your

           2   neck?

           3   A.     Correct.

           4   Q.     The pain in your right shoulder, did

           5   that travel anywhere or stay in your right

           6   shoulder?

           7   A.     Just pain down to my right shoulder

           8   from the right shoulder and arms.

           9   Q.     Your lower back, did that stay in your

          12   Q.     Discussing your right arm, when you

          14   how would you rate the pain in your right

          15   arm?

          16   A.     About same number as the neck.  The

          17   problem is this with the neck:  When I take

          18   the medicine, the pain would go away.  It

          19   helped relieve the pain.  But in terms of the

          20   shoulder, it doesn't seem to go away.  It

          21   doesn't seem to help much with medicine.

          22   Q.     You indicated when you first started

          23   to feel pain, it was the same as your neck,

          24   about a 5 or 6?

                                                           65



           1   A.     Correct.

           2   Q.     At the end of treatment, how would you

           3   rate the pain to your right arm and shoulder

           4   area?

           5   A.     Around 2 or 3.

           6   Q.     As you sit here today, how would you

           7   rate the pain to your right arm and shoulder

           8   area?

           9   A.     Around 2.  That is just sitting, not

          10   doing anything, not making much movement or

          11   not lifting anything.

          12   Q.     How about lifting things and making

          13   movement, how would you rate that pain to

          14   your right arm/shoulder area?

          15   A.     Not the same as when I was first

          16   injured, up to about 4 to 5.

          17   Q.     Discussing your low back, how would

          18   you rate your pain to your low back when you

          19   first started to feel pain?

          20   A.     Around 4 when it start.

          22   of 2017, how would you rate the pain to your

          23   low back?

          24   A.     Around 1 or 2.  That's if I'm not

                                                           66



           1   doing anything, lifting, or bending so much.

           2   Q.     As you sit here today, how would you

          11   Q.     Ma'am, I understand you didn't get out

          12   of the car on scene.

          13          Did you ever see the rear of the car

          14   you were in after the accident?

          15   A.     No.  I got so scared and nervous at

          16   the time.  I just wanted to get home and rush

          17   to get home and go and relax.

          18   Q.     After you got home following the

          19   accident, maybe not that day, maybe within

          20   the week or month, did you ever see the back

          21   of the car you were in at the time of the

          22   accident?

          23   A.     No, I did not.

          24   Q.     You never took any pictures of the

                                                           67



           1   rear of the car you were involved in because

           2   you never saw it after the accident, right?

           3   A.     Correct.

           4   Q.     Ma'am, did this accident affect your

           5   life in any way?

           6   A.     Yeah, of course a little bit here and

           7   there.  It did affect of what I can do.  I

           8   have to restrict myself from doing stuff that

           9   I used to, like moving, picking things up,

          10   lifting certain things, stocking certain

          11   things, stuff that every day that I'm used to

          12   I couldn't do much.

          13   Q.     First, as a result of this accident,

          14   is there anything that you physically cannot

          15   do anymore?

          16   A.     Well, it's more like I can still do

          17   some of them, but I would need help.  I can't

          18   do it by myself.  I will always have to ask

          19   for help.

          20   Q.     I'll get to that.  I'll ask you what

          21   you have difficulty doing later.

          22          I want to know if there is anything,

          23   as a result of this accident, you cannot do?

          24   A.     No, not like that.

           2   anything you have difficulty doing?

           3   A.     Well, it's mainly just that I can't do

           4   anything heavy.  I most often have to ask for

           5   help all the time when I have to do certain

           6   things that I can't do by myself.

           7   Q.     What are those things you can't do by

           8   yourself?

           9   A.     Just mainly at work.  I would always

          10   need someone else to come and help me carry

          11   certain things, lift up certain things, do

          12   certain things.  At home, I just do some

          13   housework, chores, and stuff like that,

          14   little things.

          15   Q.     When you say you have some difficulty

          16   carrying, what part of your body hurts when

          17   you're carrying these things at work?

          18   A.     Like if I try to lift up sodas or soda

          19   case stocks to put in a certain location at

          20   nighttime, I will start to feel very numbness

          21   to my shoulders through my arm and lower

          22   back, feeling a lot of discomfort.  So I have

          23   to take medicine to help.

          24   Q.     That lifting, how much weight in

                                                           69



           1   pounds do you have difficulty lifting?

           2   A.     I really don't know how to estimate.

           3   I don't know the estimation of what soda

           4   product, how much it weighs.  I go and see it

           5   and I try to lift it, and I realize it's

           6   heavy and hurting me.  I ask for help.  I

           7   never know in advance how much certain things

           8   weigh.

           9   Q.     You said earlier about a soda case?

          10   A.     Well, I know it's a soda case.  I

          11   don't know how many bottles of soda are in

          12   that.

          13   Q.     Do you have any difficulty doing

          14   housework?

          15   A.     Well, I manage a little cooking here

          16   and there, not much of any lifting, mainly a

          17   woman's job.

          18   Q.     Do you have any difficulty cooking?

          19   A.     I'm okay.

          20   Q.     Do you have any difficulty taking care

          21   of yourself, meaning getting dressed, using

          22   the restroom, showering, feeding yourself?

          23   A.     I'm okay.

          24   Q.     Other than that carrying and lifting,

           1   do you have any difficulty doing anything

           2   else as a result of this accident?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     Do you go to the gym at all?

           5   A.     No, I never did.

           6   Q.     Never did, not even before the

           7   accident?

           8   A.     Never ever.

           9   Q.     Do you go to church or have any

          10   activities for religion?

          11   A.     Once in a while, like do Cambodian New

          12   Years, stuff like that.

          13   Q.     Any difficulties celebrating at church

          14   or any religious function as a result of this

          15   accident?

          16   A.     No, because I don't really involve

          17   much of doing any activity.  I just go, make

          18   some donation and mainly go home.  I don't

          19   really do anything to help.

          20   Q.     Is that the same as it was before the

          21   accident, or did it change?

          22   A.     The same.  I don't do anything

          23   different.

          24   Q.     Have you traveled anywhere since the

           1   accident?

           2   A.     I don't remember.

           3   Q.     Did you get married in Cambodia?

           5   Q.     Did you travel to Cambodia, I'm

           6   assuming, for the wedding?

           7   A.     Yes.

           9   A.     Correct.

          10   Q.     Any difficulties traveling to Cambodia

          11   or getting married in 2018 as a result of

          12   this accident?

          13   A.     Well, yes, of course, there is some

          14   very discomfort, some pain here and there

          15   because it's a long flight.  I have to sit

          17   ceremony is difficult.

          18   Q.     Did you have any accommodations at

          20   accident?

          22   time, not to do everything, not to take too

          23   long because it's a very long wedding because

          24   of my discomfort.

          16               MR. MANARA:  Counsel, while we're

          17   here on the record, I would just ask if you

          18   could send me the notice of deposition you

          19   sent to my client that you previously

          20   provided.

          21               I think you said you faxed it, so

          22   I'll just ask for a fax confirmation, the

          23   e-mail you sent.  If you sent it certified

          24   mail, I would ask for that, as well.

           1               I just don't have it.  I've never

           2   seen it.  The only correspondence I have

           3   wasn't a notice of deposition.

           4               MR. LOMBARDO:  I understand.

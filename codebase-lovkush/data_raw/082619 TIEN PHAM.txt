          15   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          16   Q.     Good afternoon, Mr. Pham.  My name is

          17   Therese Schweikert.  I already gave

          18   instructions to you as well as the other two

          19   parties here before all the depositions

          20   began.

          21          Do you recall those?

          22   A.     Yes.

          23   Q.     You speak English; is that correct?

          24   A.     I do.

                                                            6



           1   Q.     Do you have any problems understanding

           2   the English language?

           3   A.     No.

           4   Q.     Do you have any problems communicating

           5   in English?

           6   A.     No.

           7   Q.     Do you feel as though you need an

           8   interpreter in order to complete the

           9   deposition?

          10   A.     No.

          11               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  If everybody

          12   else is okay, based on his answer, I can let

          13   the interpreter go.

          14               MS. KATHOPOULIS:  That's fine

          15   with me.

          16               MR. KELLY:  Okay.

          17               MS. SCHWEIKERT:  Actually, before

          18   you go.

          19   BY MS. SCHWEIKERT:

          20   Q.     Sir, do you understand that, if we go

          21   back and use this deposition transcript, you

          22   can't at that point say that you didn't

          23   understand English and that you needed an

          24   interpreter?

                                                            7



           1   A.     Understand.

           2   Q.     Before coming into to today's

           3   deposition, did you review any documents,

           4   look at any paperwork?

           5   A.     No, I did not read paper.

           6   Q.     As you sit here today, do you take any

           7   medication on a regular basis?

           8   A.     Right now I'm taking high blood

           9   pressure, high cholesterol and something like

          10   fish oil for my eyes, some kind of fish oil.

          11   Q.     Like a vitamin-type thing?

          12   A.     Something like fish oil, but the name

          13   is different.

          14   Q.     Is it prescription?

          15   A.     It's prescription.

          16   Q.     What's wrong with your eyes that you

          17   need that?

          18   A.     My eyes weak, and sometimes I see two

          19   pictures, double vision.

          20   Q.     How long has that been going on?

          21   A.     It happened just about a

          22   year-and-a-half ago.

          23   Q.     After this accident?

          24   A.     Yes.

           2   ever had to hire a lawyer for any other

           3   injury before?

           4   A.     Before, I have an accident before this

           6   Q.     How many accidents have you been in

          11   ago.  2006, 2007, somewhere around there.

          12   Q.     That's when the accident happened,

          13   2006 or so?

          14   A.     At that time, I have an accident in

           1   Q.     Then where did you go?

           2   A.     We go straight onto 5th Street because

           3   my house is 4th Street.  We were going 5th,

           4   and then we go straight down to Roosevelt

           5   Boulevard.  Then you make a right over there.

           6          Then we keep on the left lane of the

           7   boulevard so that we can get to the ramp and

           8   then we get into the expressway.

           9   Q.     When you got on the expressway, which

          10   lane did you get in?

          11   A.     For the first time, it's the right

          12   lane.  Because when we get off from the ramp,

          13   we have to get on the right lane first for a

          14   while, for about two minutes or three minutes

          15   later.  Then I told him to shift on the left

          16   because we have to go straight.

          17   Q.     When you shifted to the left, did you

          18   get into the middle lane or the far-left

          19   lane?

          20   A.     Actually, over there is two lanes.

          21   The left is the far lane, but when we go

          22   further it became three lanes.

          23   Q.     Okay.

           8   there, traffic over there.  The van come up

           9   on my right and then he shift over into the

          10   middle.  As he shift, he switch into our

          11   lane.  That's how the accident happened.

          13   when you saw this happening?

           5   Mr. Nguyen to watch out?

           6   A.     Not yet.

           7   Q.     How long was Mr. Nguyen in the middle

           8   lane before it switched to the left lane?

           9   A.     Very fast, like five seconds, very

          10   fast.

          11   Q.     Did you say anything to Mr. Nguyen?

          12   A.     When the van is moving over, I said

          13   watch out, and then the accident happened.

          14   Q.     Did you feel the brakes of the car hit

          15   before any impact?

          16   A.     Did I feel the brake?

          17   Q.     Yeah, did you feel Mr. Nguyen hit the

          18   brakes?

          19   A.     Yeah, sure.  I heard it, and

          20   Mr. Nguyen's car pushed over into the middle,

          21   the stone in the middle.  How do you call it?

          22   Q.     The guardrail?

           2   A.     When I seen the traffic.  I said

           3   traffic is jammed over there so cool down a

           4   little bit.  Then we keep driving, and

           5   Mr. Nguyen he keep driving.  I see the van

           6   switch very fast.

           7   Q.     When you told Mr. Nguyen to slow down

           8   because of the traffic, how long was that

          11   Q.     Yeah.

          12   A.     I think about ten or seven minutes

          13   before that.

          14   Q.     Ten minutes before this car accident

          15   you told Mr. Nguyen to slow down?

          16   A.     Yeah, because I saw the traffic.

          17   Q.     Do you understand how long 10 minutes

          18   are?

          19   A.     Maybe five minutes, but he got time.

          20   He slowed down.  I told him he got time.  He

           1   Q.     Yeah.

           2   A.     I have to say somewhere around

           3   half-mile.  He's about like two minutes.

           4   Q.     You see traffic about a half-mile in

           5   front of you, and it was about two minutes,

           6   not 10 minutes?

           7   A.     Yeah.

           8   Q.     You told Mr. Nguyen to slow down?

           9   A.     Yes.

          10   Q.     Then two minutes later, that's when

          11   the impact happens?

          12   A.     Yes.

          13   Q.     When the impact happens, how close is

          14   the traffic at that point?

          15   A.     Right on it, like on the right side

          16   it's traffic right there.  Into the middle

          17   side, it's traffic, also.  I don't know what

          18   happened to it.

          19          Then we are on the left side, but at

          20   that time it's traffic, so everybody got to

          21   cool down a little bit.

          22   Q.     Do you know what the speed limit is on

          23   the boulevard there?

           5   Q.     What's the conversation that you had?

           6   A.     I said, my, man, you shift lanes.

           7   It's not right.  He said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

           8   I didn't see you guys.  He told me about

           9   that.  I said maybe your van is too tall,

          10   that's why you cannot see us.

          11   Q.     Did you see anything happen in front

          12   of the van before this happened, like a car

          13   cut in?

          14   A.     Yes.

          15   Q.     You saw the car cut in front of my

          16   client before the accident happened?

          17   A.     Yeah, because at that time stopped

          18   traffic, and the guy switch over into the

          19   middle lane and then some car crossed by.

          20   Q.     And crossed in front of him?

          21   A.     That's why he crossed onto us, because

          22   he's late for work or something.  I think

          23   he's late for work or something.

          24   Q.     Do you know what time the interview

           2   A.     I don't remember, but I know in the

          14   to Delaware?

          15   A.     I don't remember, but from my estimate

          16   it's somewhere around two-hour-and-a-half, so

          17   we have to go early.

          18   Q.     Do you know what would happen if you

          19   didn't make that appointment?

           4   A.     We stopped into the left lane, but the

           5   traffic backed up.  I asked the guy, why

           6   don't we move to the right because there is

           7   no shoulder over there.  So we are slowly

           8   moving down to the right, and the police

           9   came.  Some guy called the police.

          10          The police came, and I talked to him

          11   for a while and then the ambulance came.  The

          12   man asked me, do you need an ambulance?  I

          13   said maybe my friend Mr. Vu need it, because

          14   he was seated in the back and he was so

          15   nervous.

          16   Q.     Then what happened?

           8   appointment at 12:00 or 1:00.  Right now it's

           9   still early, so why do we have to call them.

          18   first saw it?

          19   A.     Like I said, for the first time, he

          20   was in the far lane and then he shift into

          21   the middle lane and then he shift into our

          22   lane very fast.

          23   Q.     You said the first time that you saw

           4   Q.     Do you know why that van shifted to

           5   the middle?

           7   That's why he needed to change lanes.

           8   Q.     How long was that van in the middle

           9   lane before it shifted to the left lane?

          10   A.     Very fast.  I think about five

          11   seconds.  He shift right away.

          12   Q.     Do you know why that van shifted from

          13   the middle lane to the left lane?

          19   remember?

          21   attention was our car and his car.

          22   Q.     The road in that area, is it flat,

          23   uphill, downhill?

           4   for Mr. Nguyen.  For the first time, he said.

           5          He cannot drive.  I said you have to

           6   drive it because we tried to make an

           7   appointment, and you would be in trouble.

           8   Q.     Do you recall what time the accident

           9   happened?

          10   A.     I think early in the morning somewhere

          11   around 8:30 or 9:00.  We went really early.

          12   Q.     You said the appointment was around

          13   12:00 or 1:00?

          14   A.     Yeah, late, very late.  Yes, late,

          15   that's why we have to go down there.

          16   Q.     You left extremely early.  You said it

          17   took about two-and-a-half hours from

          18   Philadelphia to?

          19   A.     Delaware.  Plus, we don't want to miss

          20   an appointment.  That's why we have to go

          21   early.

          22   Q.     Have you had any surgery as a result

          23   of this accident?

          24   A.     No.

           1   Q.     Have you paid any co-pays as a result

           2   of this accident?

           3   A.     No.

           4               MS. KATHOPOULIS:  Counsel, we

           5   already confirmed no wage loss, no claim for

           6   past or future earnings?

           7               MR. KELLY:  Correct.

           8               MS. KATHOPOULIS:  I am finished.

           9   Thank you.
